We have identified several kinases that are likely to form a new MAP kinase pathway that suppresses synapse formation defects, but not axon termination defects, in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants. This pathway includes: MIG-15 (MAP4K), NSY-1 (MAP3K), JKK-1 (MAP2K) and JNK-1 (MAPK). Transgenic overexpression of kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is sufficient to impair synapse formation in wild-type animals. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions cell autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons, and these kinases localize to presynaptic terminals providing further evidence of a role in synapse development. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling also suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit that is likely to arise from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. Interestingly, habituation results are consistent with the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functioning as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1. These findings indicate the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway can restrict both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning.\\n\",\n          \"Increased incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has been recognized as a critical challenge to communicable disease control and public health response. This study aimed to quantify the association between climate variation and notified cases of HFMD in selected cities of Shanxi Province, and to provide evidence for disease control and prevention. Meteorological variables and HFMD cases data in 4 major cities (Datong, Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng) of Shanxi province, China, were obtained from the China Meteorology Administration and China CDC respectively over the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. Correlations analyses and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were used to identify and quantify the relationship between the meteorological variables and HFMD. HFMD incidence varied seasonally with the majority of cases in the 4 cities occurring from May to July. Temperatures could play important roles in the incidence of HFMD in these regions. The SARIMA models indicate that a 1\\u00b0 C rise in average, maximum and minimum temperatures may lead to a similar relative increase in the number of cases in the 4 cities. The lag times for the effects of temperatures were identified in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng. The numbers of cases were positively associated with average and minimum temperatures at a lag of 1 week in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng, and with maximum temperature at a lag of 2 weeks in Yuncheng. Positive association between the temperature and HFMD has been identified from the 4 cities in Shanxi Province, although the role of weather variables on the transmission of HFMD varied in the 4 cities. Relevant prevention measures and public health action are required to reduce future risks of climate change with consideration of local climatic conditions.\\n\",\n          \"Previous works showed that immunization with saliva from Lutzomyia intermedia, a vector of Leishmania braziliensis, does not protect against experimental infection. However, L. braziliensis is also transmitted by Lutzomyia whitmani, a sand fly species closely related to Lu. intermedia. Herein we describe the immune response following immunization with Lu. whitmani saliva and the outcome of this response after L. braziliensis infection.\\nBALB/c mice immunized with Lu. whitmani saliva developed robust humoral and cellular immune responses, the latter characterized by an intense cellular infiltrate and production of IFN-\\u03b3 and IL-10, by both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Mice immunized as above and challenged with L. braziliensis plus Lu. whitmani saliva displayed significantly smaller lesions and parasite load at the challenge site. This protection was associated with a higher (p<0.05) IFN-\\u03b3 production in response to SLA stimulation. Long-term persisting immunity was also detected in mice immunized with Lu. whitmani saliva. Furthermore, individuals residing in an endemic area for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) presented antibody responses to Lu. whitmani saliva. However CL patients, with active lesions, displayed a lower humoral response to Lu. whitmani saliva compared to individuals with subclinical Leishmania infection.\\nPre-exposure to Lu. whitmani saliva induces protection against L. braziliensis in a murine model. We also show that Lu. whitmani salivary proteins are immunogenic in naturally exposed individuals. Our results reinforce the importance of investigating the immunomodulatory effect of saliva from different species of closely related sand flies.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"plain language summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26124,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"We explored the molecular mechanisms that govern synapse formation in vivo using the nematode C. elegans. Our results have identified a conserved MIG-15/JNK-1 MAPK pathway that restricts formation of glutamatergic, neuron-neuron synapses in the mechanosensory neurons, but does not restrict synapse formation in motor neurons. This could have important implications because synapses made by the mechanosensory neurons are reminiscent of synapses in the mammalian central nervous system, and relatively little is known about the signals that specifically influence central synapse formation in vivo. Interestingly, our results are consistent with the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway opposing RPM-1, a signaling hub and ubiquitin ligase that inhibits different JNK and p38 signaling pathways. This suggests RPM-1 might inhibit specific MAPK pathways, such as the DLK-1 pathway, rather than simply acting as a general inhibitor of JNK and p38 signaling in neurons. Our results are particularly interesting given emerging links between JNK MAPK signaling and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.\\n\",\n          \"The high fidelity of DNA replication is safeguarded by the accuracy of nucleotide selection by DNA polymerases, proofreading activity of the replicative polymerases, and the DNA mismatch repair system. Errors made by replicative polymerases are corrected by mismatch repair, and inactivation of the mismatch repair system results in a multiplicative increase in error rates when combined with a proofreading deficient allele of a replicative polymerase. In this study, we demonstrate that the deletion of two non-essential genes encoding for two subunits of Pol \\u03b5 give an increased mutation rate due to increased synthesis by the error-prone DNA polymerase \\u03b6. Surprisingly, there was no multiplicative increase in error rates when the mismatch repair system was inactivated. We propose that the deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 gives a defective replisome, which in turn gives increased synthesis, in part, by Pol \\u03b6 during an error-prone post-replication process that is not efficiently repaired by the mismatch repair system.\\n\",\n          \"Leprosy is an infectious disease with a strong host genetic component. The identification of host genetic lesions predisposing to disease is a powerful approach for mapping key junctions in the host pathogen interplay. Genetic variants located in the promoter region of the PARK2 gene are replicated leprosy susceptibility factors. To better understand a possible contribution of PARK2 to host effector mechanisms in leprosy patients, we developed a cellular model to test the contribution of the PARK2 encoded parkin protein to host responses to mycobacterial antigens. We observed that parkin was a mediator of IL-6 production in response to mycobacterial antigen in both THP-1 macrophages and human Schwann cells while human monocyte-derived macrophages needed to be pre-activated with VitD to show the same impact. Parkin also impacted on the constitutive production of MCP-1. The regulatory activity of parkin on cytokine production was found to be independent of the canonical TLR-NF\\u03baB signalling pathway. We also tested association of IL6 and CCL2 gene expression levels in whole blood assays with PARK2 polymorphisms. For both cytokines, we found significant associations with those PARK2 variants that were established leprosy susceptibility factors. Hence, our results show that genetic PARK2 variants that are correlated with leprosy susceptibility are also correlated with production of these cytokines following stimulation with M. leprae sonicate.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26124,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Information is relayed throughout the nervous system via chemical synapses, and the process of synapse formation is essential for construction of neural circuitry [1, 2]. In the central nervous system, most synaptic connections are glutamatergic and often referred to as central synapses.\\n\\nDifferent neurons in the nematode C. elegans have proven extremely valuable in identifying conserved regulators of synapse formation, including motor neurons, HSN neurons, and mechanosensory neurons [3, 4]. Of these, only the mechanosensory neurons form glutamatergic, neuron-neuron synapses that are reminiscent of central synapses. Genetic screens using mechanosensory neurons have revealed several molecules that regulate glutamatergic synapse formation including the intracellular signaling hub Regulator of Presynaptic Morphology 1 (RPM-1) [5], the F-box protein MEC-15 [6], the transcription factor SAM-10 [7], the focal adhesion protein ZYX-1/Zyxin [8], and the microRNA LIN-4 [9].\\n\\nC. elegans has two PLM mechanosensory neurons, which sense posterior gentle touch [10]. The PLM neurons form electrical synapses and glutamatergic chemical synapses with postsynaptic interneurons [10\\u201312]. Initial touch sensation is thought to rely upon both electrical synapses and glutamatergic transmission. Glutamatergic transmission is also required for more complex touch-response behaviors, such as habituation to repeated tap and arousal from a sleep-like state called lethargus [13, 14].\\n\\nRPM-1 is the C. elegans ortholog of mouse Phr1 and Drosophila Highwire, which are collectively referred to as Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) proteins. RPM-1 is a relatively broad regulator of synapse formation and axon termination affecting these processes in mechanosensory neurons and motor neurons [5, 15\\u201317]. Studies in flies and mice have shown these are conserved RPM-1 functions [18\\u201322]. Previous work showed RPM-1 functions in the mechanosensory neurons during development to regulate habituation to repeated tap stimulus, a behavioral deficit that likely results from abnormal glutamatergic synapse formation in rpm-1 mutants [23].\\n\\nPHR proteins are enormous intracellular signaling hubs that regulate numerous downstream pathways [15]. Proteomic screens identified several RPM-1 binding proteins that mediate RPM-1 function during development including: the RCC1-like protein GLO-4 [24], the microtubule binding protein RAE-1 [25, 26], the PP2C phosphatase PPM-2 [27], and the Nesprin ANC-1 [28]. Suppressor genetics revealed that RPM-1 inhibits p38 and JNK MAPK signaling [29\\u201331]. Studies from flies and mammals have shown this is a conserved PHR protein function [32\\u201334]. RPM-1 inhibits MAPK signaling by ubiquitinating MAP3Ks, such as DLK-1 and MLK-1, thereby targeting them for degradation by the proteasome [29, 35, 36]. At present, it remains unclear whether RPM-1 is a general inhibitor of MAP3Ks during neuronal development, or a potentially selective regulator of certain p38 and JNK pathways.\\n\\nJNK MAP kinase pathways play a conserved role in synapse formation in the developing nervous system [37]. Studies in worms [29, 30], flies [32, 38] and vertebrates [39, 40] have shown JNK signaling needs to be restricted for proper synapse formation. The role of JNK signaling in synapse formation has been primarily explored using the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in different organisms. Much less is known about how JNK signaling impacts the formation of neuron-neuron, central synapses in vivo. It also remains unclear if JNK isoforms have differential roles in mediating synapse formation in different types of neurons. The importance of addressing these gaps in our knowledge is highlighted by emerging links between altered JNK signaling and synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [41\\u201344].\\n\\nJNK activation is regulated by upstream kinase cascades that include MAP2Ks, MAP3Ks, and in some cases MAP4Ks. In vitro biochemistry and genetic studies on fly embryogenesis have shown Misshapen (Msn), called MIG-15 in worms and NIK (HGK/MAP4K4) in mammals, can function as a MAP4K that activates JNK signaling [45\\u201347]. While MIG-15 and Msn regulate axon guidance in the nervous system, they do so through the cytoskeletal regulators ERM-1 and Bifocal [48, 49]. To date, functional links in the nervous system between JNK signaling and MIG-15 or Msn have remained stubbornly elusive.\\n\\nUsing suppressor genetics, we identified several kinases that are likely to be part of a new JNK pathway that regulates glutamatergic, neuron-neuron synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons of C. elegans. This JNK pathway is composed of MIG-15 (MAP4K), NSY-1 (MAP3K), JKK-1 (MAP2K), and JNK-1. Loss of function mutations in kinases of the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway specifically suppress defects in synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants. Consistent with suppression results, transgenic overexpression of kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway in wild-type animals results in impaired synapse formation. Further biochemical support for the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway comes from our observation that NSY-1 can bind both MIG-15 and JKK-1 when expressed in HEK 293 cells.\\n\\nBased on prior work, the most likely signaling model that might explain our results is RPM-1 acting as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit an upstream kinase in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway, similar to RPM-1 effects on the DLK-1 and MLK-1 pathways. However, our behavioral analysis of habituation indicated the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is more likely to function as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1. These results provide the first potential link in the nervous system between the MIG-15 MAP4K and a JNK isoform, and indicate MIG-15/JNK-1 activity can affect synapse formation and short-term learning.\\n\\nPrevious studies showed that loss-of-function mutations in kinases of the DLK-1/PMK-3 p38 MAPK pathway and the MLK-1/KGB-1 JNK pathway suppress synapse formation defects in rpm-1 mutants [29, 30]. A different pathway consisting of JNK-1 and an MKK7 ortholog JKK-1 functions in the nervous system to regulate locomotion, and synaptic vesicle trafficking in GABAergic motor neurons [50, 51]. jkk-1 and jnk-1 also suppress synaptic position defects in cholinergic NMJs of arl-8 mutants [52]. These observations prompted us to test whether jkk-1 and jnk-1 could suppress defects in synapse formation and axon termination caused by rpm-1 loss of function (lf) in the mechanosensory neurons.\\n\\nC. elegans has two PLM mechanosensory neurons, one on each side of its body. Each PLM neuron extends a single axon that terminates growth prior to the cell body of the ALM mechanosensory neuron (Fig 1A and 1B). Glutamatergic chemical synapses are formed en passant with interneurons by a collateral branch that extends from the primary axon (Fig 1A and 1D). The transgene muIs32, which expresses GFP in the mechanosensory neurons, can be used to assess PLM neurons for axon termination, as well as formation of the synaptic branch and synaptic boutons [24]. Anatomical separation of axon termination and chemical synapse formation makes the PLM neurons an ideal system to assess these two developmental processes within the same neuron.\\n\\nConsistent with prior studies [5, 53], we observed that rpm-1 mutants display two phenotypes in the PLM neurons. The first is failed axon termination, which results in the PLM axon extending beyond the ALM cell body and hooking towards the ventral side of the animal, which we refer to as a hook defect (Fig 1B). The second phenotype is retraction of the synaptic branch, which results from impaired synapse formation (Fig 1D) [5]. Quantitation of axon termination defects, and synaptic branch defects in rpm-1 mutants are shown in Fig 1C and 1E, respectively.\\n\\nTo test if jkk-1 and jnk-1 affect axon termination and synapse formation of PLM neurons, we generated double mutants with previously described null alleles for jkk-1 (km2) and jnk-1 (gk7) [50, 54]. rpm-1; jkk-1 and rpm-1; jnk-1 double mutants did not show changes in the frequency of axon termination defects (Fig 1B and 1C). In contrast, synaptic branch defects were significantly suppressed in both double mutants (Fig 1D and 1E).\\n\\nGiven that both jkk-1 and jnk-1 suppress synaptic branch defects, but not axon termination defects, we tested whether they function in the same genetic pathway. To do so, we generated rpm-1; jkk-1; jnk-1 triple mutants. We observed no further suppression of synaptic branch defects in triple mutants (Fig 1E), and again saw no suppression of axon termination defects (Fig 1C). These results are consistent with jkk-1 and jnk-1 functioning in the same genetic pathway to specifically suppress synapse formation defects in the PLM neurons of rpm-1 mutants.\\n\\nNext, we explored MAP3Ks and MAP4Ks that might exist in the JKK-1/JNK-1 pathway. We began by testing the MAP3K NSY-1 because it regulates olfactory neuron fate during development [55], and its mammalian ortholog ASK activates JNK signaling in vitro [56]. To analyze genetic interactions between rpm-1 and nsy-1, we used a previously described nsy-1 allele, ok593, that deletes the kinase domain and is likely to be a null. Similar to outcomes with jkk-1 and jnk-1, we observed suppression of synaptic branch defects in rpm-1; nsy-1 double mutants, but did not see changes in axon termination defects (Fig 2A and 2D). Quantitation showed that suppression of synaptic branch defects in rpm-1; nsy-1 double mutants was significant compared to rpm-1 single mutants (Fig 2E). No significant decrease in axon termination defects occurred in rpm-1; nsy-1 double mutants (Fig 2B). Importantly, no increased suppression occurred in rpm-1; jnk-1; nsy-1 triple mutants compared to either double mutant (Fig 2E). These results are consistent with nsy-1 functioning in the same pathway as jnk-1 to suppress synapse formation defects.\\n\\nPrevious studies on MAP kinases regulating neuronal development in C. elegans have often identified three component pathways (MAP3K, MAP2K and MAPK) [29\\u201331]. At present, potential MAP4Ks that regulate JNK signaling in neuronal development remain unknown. MIG-15 is orthologous to mammalian NIK and fly Msn, which can act as MAP4Ks in cultured cells and during embryogenesis [46, 47]. In the developing C. elegans nervous system, MIG-15 regulates cell migration and axon guidance, but functional genetic links to JNK signaling in neurons remain absent [57, 58]. Therefore, we tested if loss of MIG-15 function specifically suppresses synapse formation defects in rpm-1 mutants similar to nsy-1, jkk-1 and jnk-1. We used a strong loss of function allele, mu342, that is a point mutation in the MIG-15 kinase domain and likely to disrupt kinase activity [58]. Axon termination defects were not suppressed in rpm-1; mig-15 double mutants (Fig 2A and 2C). However, synaptic branch defects were significantly suppressed in rpm-1; mig-15 double mutants (Fig 2D and 2F). It should be noted that in some mig-15 mutants, the PVM cell body did not migrate normally, which is consistent with previously described cell migration defects (Fig 2D). Similar to results with nsy-1, further suppression of branch defects was not observed in rpm-1; jnk-1; mig-15 triple mutants compared to rpm-1; mig-15 double mutants. This result is consistent with mig-15 functioning in the same genetic pathway as jnk-1.\\n\\nThe logic of how MAPK modules operate suggests the most likely order for this putative kinase pathway from most upstream to downstream kinase would be: MIG-15/NSY-1/JKK-1/JNK-1. However, our genetic results do not rule out the alternative possibility that these kinases are part of multiple MAPK pathways that function in parallel to suppress synapse formation defects, but not axon termination defects, caused by rpm-1 (lf).\\n\\nIn addition, we observed a low but significant level of synaptic branch defects in mig-15 single mutants (Fig 2F). This observation, and suppression of synaptic branch defects caused by rpm-1 (lf) suggest that a balance of MIG-15 activity is required for proper synapse formation in the PLM neurons.\\n\\nPrevious studies suggested impaired synapse formation in rpm-1 mutants leads to retraction of the PLM synaptic branch [5]. Therefore, the absence of the synaptic branch served as a proxy for assessing synapse formation in different double mutants of rpm-1 and kinases of interest. However, there are two possible cellular explanations for why synaptic branch defects are suppressed. The first is that synapse formation is improved. Alternatively, MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 kinases might be required for synaptic branch retraction.\\n\\nTo differentiate between these two possibilities, we simultaneously labeled PLM neurons with two transgenes: 1) jsIs1114 which expresses the synaptic vesicle marker GFP::RAB-3, and 2) jsIs973 which expresses mRFP and allows the morphology of the axon, synaptic branch and synaptic boutons to be visualized. RAB-3 is a small G-protein that associates with synaptic vesicles (SV), and has been used to assess synaptogenesis in PLM neurons [8]. Consistent with prior work, we observed GFP::RAB-3 at the presynaptic boutons of wild-type animals (Fig 3A). In confocal projections, it is possible to see synaptic boutons from both the left and right PLM neurons (PLML and PLMR) as they reside in the same z-plane in the ventral nerve cord. However, the morphology of only a single PLM axon can be visualized (Fig 3A). We observed two phenotypic groups of rpm-1 mutants. The first, and most common, lacked one of the two PLM synaptic branches. The example shown in Fig 3A (rpm-1 left absent) is missing the left PLM synaptic branch and accompanying GFP::RAB-3 accumulations, but GFP::RAB-3 from PLMR is still present. Less frequently, we observed rpm-1 mutants in which both PLM neurons lack a synaptic branch and show no presynaptic GFP::RAB-3 accumulation (Fig 3A, rpm-1 both absent). Quantitation showed accumulation of RAB-3 always corresponded with the presence of a synaptic branch in wild-type animals (Fig 3C). The frequency of complete synaptic branches, defined as branches with presynaptic boutons and GFP::RAB-3 accumulation, were reduced in rpm-1 mutants (Fig 3C). In rpm-1; mig-15 and rpm-1; jkk-1 double mutants, we observed an increase in the number of complete synaptic branches and corresponding accumulation of GFP::RAB-3 at presynaptic terminals (Fig 3B and 3C). Thus, mig-15 and jkk-1 suppression of rpm-1 results in improved synapse formation.\\n\\nLoss of function in NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 had minimal effects on PLM synapse formation, as assessed by the presence of the synaptic branch and presynaptic boutons (Figs 1E and 2E). Nonetheless, it was possible more subtle changes might exist in morphology or number of presynaptic terminals when these kinases are perturbed.\\n\\nTo test this, we utilized transgenic worms that express either the synaptic vesicle marker GFP::RAB-3, or the active zone marker UNC-10::tdTOMATO in the mechanosensory neurons (Fig 4A and 4B). Transgenes with an appropriate cell fill marker (GFP or mRFP) were evaluated simultaneously to anatomically identify PLM presynaptic terminals. Both presynaptic RAB-3 and UNC-10 puncta size and number showed no significant differences when wild-type animals were compared to jnk-1, jkk-1 or nsy-1 mutants (Fig 4C and 4D). Data for nsy-1 and GFP::RAB-3 is not shown because recombinants between nsy-1 and the RAB-3 transgene could not be obtained.\\n\\nTo further evaluate whether these kinases might affect synapse formation outside of rpm-1 suppression, we turned to the microtubule destabilizing drug colchicine. It was previously shown that treating wild-type worms with colchicine causes synapse formation defects in PLM neurons [59]. This provided us with a pharmacological manipulation to further examine the role of the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway in synapse formation. While no effect was observed with the vehicle DMSO, we found that low frequency synaptic branch defects caused by colchicine were enhanced in jnk-1, jkk-1 or nsy-1 mutants (Fig 4E and 4F). These observations indicate altering microtubule stability can also unveil a role for NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 in glutamatergic synapse formation.\\n\\nOur genetic analysis showed mig-15, nsy-1, jkk-1 and jnk-1 are likely to function in a linear genetic pathway to suppress synapse formation defects in rpm-1 mutants. Next, we wanted to determine if these kinases regulate synapse formation by functioning cell autonomously within PLM neurons, or non-cell autonomously in surrounding tissue. We addressed this with transgenic rescue experiments using double mutants of rpm-1 and different kinases. Transgenic expression of kinases was driven by the mec-7 promoter, which is expressed in mechanosensory neurons including the PLM neurons, and is not expressed in the postsynaptic interneurons or tissues that surround the PLM synapse, such as muscles or hypodermis. NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 were expressed using transgenic extrachromasomal arrays. MIG-15 was expressed using a MosSCI single-copy integrated transgene because mig-15 mutants have small body and brood size, which made deriving extrachromosomal arrays extremely difficult. Expression of each kinase in PLM neurons gave significant, robust rescue of suppression in kinase double mutants with rpm-1 (Fig 5A and 5B). For example, transgenic expression of JNK-1 (but not the negative control protein mCherry) in rpm-1; jnk-1 double mutants significantly rescued suppression of synaptic branch defects (Fig 5A and 5B). Our findings support the conclusion that MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 function cell autonomously in PLM mechanosensory neurons, and are consistent with these kinases functioning in a linear cascade to regulate synapse formation.\\n\\nOur observation that loss of MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1 or JNK-1 improves synapse formation defects in rpm-1 mutants suggests these kinases might inhibit synapse formation. To test this hypothesis, we transgenically overexpressed individual kinases in wild-type animals using the pan-neuronal rgef-1 promoter, which has been used previously for transgenic overexpression experiments with PLM neurons [30, 53]. PLM synaptic branches were not altered in wild-type animals carrying transgenic extrachromosomal arrays that overexpress mCherry, which was used as a negative control (Fig 6A and 6B). In contrast, transgenic overexpression of MIG-15, NSY-1 or JKK-1 in wild-type worms resulted in synaptic branch defects (Fig 6A and 6B). Transgenic overexpression of JNK-1 did not lead to defects (Fig 6B). This result with JNK-1, which is likely at the bottom of a possible MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway, is not surprising given the prior finding that kinases such as the p38 MAPK PMK-3 and the JNK isoform KGB-1 generate relatively low frequency defects when transgenically overexpressed [30]. Nonetheless, our results show that overexpressing MIG-15, NSY-1 or JKK-1 is sufficient to impair synapse formation. This indicates that these kinases need to be opposed functionally or restricted for proper PLM synapse formation to occur. Furthermore, synapse formation defects caused by overexpression of MIG-15, NSY-1 and JKK-1 occurred at similar levels, which provides further evidence these kinases could function in the same MAPK pathway.\\n\\nOur genetic experiments suggested that MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 potentially function in a novel MAPK pathway that regulates synapse formation in PLM neurons. We wanted to further evaluate the biochemistry that underpins these findings.\\n\\nPrevious in vitro experiments showed MAP3Ks often bind to both MAP4Ks and MAP2Ks in the same pathway [60]. For example, MEKK1 (MAP3K1) binds to both the MAP4K NIK and the MAP2K MKK4 [46, 61], while NSY-1 binds to the MAP2K SEK-1 [62]. To test whether similar interactions occur between the NSY-1 MAP3K and the MIG-15 MAP4K or JKK-1 MAP2K, HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLAG or HA tagged kinases and binding was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation. When NSY-1 was immunoprecipitated from transfected cell lysates, we detected coprecipitating MIG-15 (Fig 7A) and JKK-1 (Fig 7B). NSY-1 binding to both MIG-15 and JKK-1 provides biochemical evidence that these kinases could function in a linear MAPK pathway.\\n\\nBecause MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 affect synapse formation, it is plausible these kinases might localize to presynaptic terminals. To explore this, we generated transgenic extrachromosomal arrays that simultaneously expressed mCherry and GFP::JNK-1. As shown in Fig 8A, GFP::JNK-1 localized to the presynaptic boutons of PLM neurons. JNK-1 was also observed in the axon and synaptic branch. GFP::NSY-1 similarly localized to presynaptic boutons (Fig 8B). We tried to determine if MIG-15 and JKK-1 localize to presynaptic terminals, but these constructs were not readily detected in PLM neurons.\\n\\nTo further define presynaptic localization, we simultaneously expressed GFP::JNK-1 and the active zone marker UNC-10::tdTOMATO. Confocal microscopy showed colocalization between GFP::JNK-1 and UNC-10::tdTOMATO at presynaptic terminals (Fig 8C). This demonstrates that JNK-1 localizes to the presynaptic active zone of PLM mechanosensory neurons. Collectively, these results are consistent with NSY-1 and JNK-1 regulating glutamatergic synapse formation.\\n\\nRPM-1 and its orthologs, Drosophila Highwire and mouse Phr1, regulate synaptogenesis at NMJs [16, 18, 19]. Loss of function in the DLK-1/PMK-3 or MLK-1/KGB-1 kinase pathway suppresses synapse formation defects in the GABAergic motor neurons of rpm-1 mutants [29, 30]. Therefore, we tested whether NSY-1 and JKK-1 affect defects in GABAergic NMJs caused by rpm-1 (lf).\\n\\nThe GABAergic DD motor neurons of C. elegans form synapses with dorsal body wall muscles (Fig 9A). To visualize GABAergic NMJs we used juIs1, a transgene that expresses the synaptic vesicle marker Synaptobrevin-1 fused to GFP (SNB-1::GFP). We observed regularly spaced presynaptic puncta in wild-type animals labeled with SNB-1 (Fig 9A). Consistent with previous studies, rpm-1 mutants had synapse formation defects in which large sections of the dorsal cord lacked SNB-1 puncta, and SNB-1 puncta aggregated (Fig 9A). Interestingly, synapse formation defects were unchanged in rpm-1; jkk-1 and rpm-1; nsy-1 double mutants (Fig 9A). Quantitation of SNB-1 puncta confirmed synapse formation defects in GABAergic motor neurons of rpm-1; jkk-1 or rpm-1; nsy-1 double mutants were not suppressed compared to rpm-1 single mutants (Fig 9B). We observed a small, significant defect in NMJ formation in jkk-1 single mutants (Fig 9B). This suggests JKK-1 might regulate GABAergic synapse formation. Overall, these results demonstrate that NSY-1 and JKK-1 do not affect RPM-1 regulation of synapse formation in GABAergic motor neurons the way they do in PLM mechanosensory neurons. This indicates that loss of NSY-1 and JKK-1 specifically suppresses synapse formation defects at glutamatergic, neuron-neuron connections.\\n\\nThe mechanosensory neurons mediate gentle touch responses, including the response to non-localized mechanical stimuli such as vibrations caused by tapping the plate on which worms grow. The mechanosensory neurons, including the PLM neurons, propagate sensory activity primarily via electrical synapses at sites along the primary axon (Fig 10A) [10, 63]. Glutamatergic chemical synapses are formed in an anatomically distinct location on the collateral synaptic branch, and contribute to a lesser extent to touch sensation (Fig 10A) [10, 11]. Glutamatergic transmission has been implicated in short-term learning, specifically habituation to repeated tap stimuli [13, 23].\\n\\nPrevious work showed rpm-1 mutants respond normally to touch [5, 23], which is consistent with these animals having normal electrical synapses in their mechanosensory neurons [64] (Borgen and Grill, in press). In contrast, rpm-1 mutants have dramatic defects in habitation to repeated tap, which result from loss of RPM-1 function in the mechanosensory neurons [23]. This suggests that habituation defects in rpm-1 mutants are likely to result from defective chemical synapse formation. Thus, tap habituation is a reasonable behavioral readout to further test the genetic relationship between rpm-1 and kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway. Tap habituation also provided us with a whole-animal, physiological assay that is sensitive to impacts on chemical synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig 10B, wild-type animals displayed habituation to repeated tap, in which responses diminish with increasing tap stimuli over time. Consistent with prior findings [23], rpm-1 mutants were defective in habituation, and maintained a high probability of response over repeated tap stimuli (Fig 10B). Tap habituation defects were suppressed in double mutants of rpm-1 with jnk-1, jkk-1 or nsy-1 (Fig 10B, 10C and 10D). Defects in body morphology and locomotion prevented us from testing mig-15 mutants. These behavioral findings show that loss of NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 suppress rpm-1 in the context of tap habituation. This finding correlates nicely with our findings on chemical synapse formation in PLM neurons. It also provides further behavioral evidence that is consistent with NSY-1, JKK-1 and JNK-1 functioning in the same pathway.\\n\\nOur observation that impairing kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway suppresses rpm-1 (lf) could be explained by two different signaling models. First, RPM-1 might function as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway (Fig 10E, Model 1), similar to what occurs with the DLK-1/PMK-3 and MLK-1/KGB-1 pathways [29, 30]. Alternatively, RPM-1 could function in a parallel opposing pathway to MIG-15/JNK-1 (Fig 10E, Model 2). Our unexpected observation that jnk-1 and jkk-1 single mutants have more rapid habituation, the opposing phenotype to rpm-1, provided us with an ideal phenotypic relationship to test genetic epistasis (Fig 10B and 10C). rpm-1; jnk-1 and rpm-1; jkk-1 double mutants had an intermediate habituation phenotype similar to wild-type animals (Fig 10B and 10C). This suggests it is likely the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions in a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1 (Fig 10E, Model 2). It is not clear to us why nsy-1 mutants did not have increased habituation. One possibility is another, unknown MAP3K functions redundantly with NSY-1 to regulate JKK-1. Nonetheless, we also observed an intermediate habituation phenotype in rpm-1; nsy-1 double mutants (Fig 10D). Collectively, these habituation results with JNK-1, JKK-1 and NSY-1 are consistent with the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functioning as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1 (Fig 10E, Model 2).\\n\\nPrevious studies have shown the C. elegans PHR protein RPM-1 functions through multiple mechanisms to regulate synapse formation and axon termination [15]. One mechanism is RPM-1 acting as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit p38 and JNK signaling pathways. It remains unclear how broad a regulator of p38 and JNK signaling RPM-1 is. Furthermore, it is unknown if there are pathways that interact with RPM-1 to specifically affect synapse formation.\\n\\nHere we identify several kinases, that are likely to form a MAP kinase pathway, that specifically suppresses synapse formation defects caused by rpm-1 (lf) in the mechanosensory neurons. This pathway is composed of the MIG-15 MAP4K, the NSY-1 MAP3K, the JKK-1 MAP2K and the JNK isoform JNK-1 (Fig 10E). Mutations in kinases of the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway suppress synapse formation defects in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants, and suppress accompanying deficits in habituation. Furthermore, behavioral analysis is consistent with the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway most likely functioning as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1. Thus, our results suggest the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway needs to be opposed by RPM-1 signaling for proper glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning (Fig 10E, Model 2). Our results also address an important missing functional link between the MIG-15 MAP4K and JNK in the nervous system.\\n\\nBiochemical studies and genetics on fly embryogenesis showed the orthologs of MIG-15 (Msn and NIK) activate JNK signaling [46, 47]. In worms and flies, MIG-15 and Msn regulate axon guidance by functioning through the cytoskeletal regulators, ERM-1 and Bifocal, rather than acting on JNK signaling [48, 49]. At present, it is unknown if MIG-15, Msn or NIK function through JNK signaling in the nervous system.\\n\\nWe now provide evidence that MIG-15 is likely to function in a JNK pathway to regulate synapse formation in mechanosensory neurons. If this is the case, in the developing worm nervous system MIG-15 regulates axon guidance through the actin regulator ERM-1, and regulates synapse formation through a kinase pathway that includes the JNK isoform JNK-1. Our results show mig-15 mutants have mild defects in synapse formation, and suppress the strong synapse formation defects caused by rpm-1 (lf) (Figs 2 and 3). This suggests a balance of MIG-15 signaling is important for proper glutamatergic synapse formation. The importance of our finding is accentuated by recent work showing NIK potentially mediates synapse loss during neurodegeneration in ALS [65].\\n\\nNumerous observations collectively support the conclusion that mig-15, nsy-1, jkk-1 and jnk-1 function in the same pathway. 1) Suppression of synapse formation defects caused by rpm-1 is not increased when multiple kinases are eliminated compared to elimination of a single kinase (Figs 1 and 2). 2) The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway has a specific suppressor phenotype: These kinases suppress synapse formation defects, but not axon termination defects, in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants (Figs 1 and 2). 3) Kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway function cell autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons (Fig 5). 4) Transgenic overexpression of MIG-15, NSY-1 or JKK-1 causes synapse formation defects at a similar frequency (Fig 6). 5) nsy-1, jkk-1 and jnk-1 suppress defects in tap habituation in rpm-1 mutants (Fig 10). 6) Finally, our biochemical results show that NSY-1 binds to MIG-15 and JKK-1 (Fig 7). Our findings on the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway and the order we have assigned to kinases in the pathway agrees with prior in vitro biochemistry, genetic results on fly embryogenesis, and is consistent with how MAPK cascades generally operate [45]. However, our results do not definitively rule out the alternative possibility that theses kinases could function in multiple, parallel MAPK pathways. This is important to note, as prior work has shown that NSY-1 can stimulate activation of p38 MAPK [55].\\n\\nPrior work showed JKK-1 and JNK-1 function in the same pathway to regulate locomotion, synaptic vesicle trafficking and ARL-8 regulation of synaptic position [51, 52]. Our results now identify a new function for JKK-1 and JNK-1 in glutamatergic synapse formation, and suggest MIG-15 and NSY-1 are likely to be further kinases in this pathway. It is unlikely impaired synaptic vesicle trafficking in jnk-1 and jkk-1 mutants would explain our findings, as we observe the opposite phenotype, an improvement in synapse formation defects in rpm-1; jkk-1 and rpm-1; jnk-1 double mutants. However, if synaptic vesicle trafficking to glutamatergic presynaptic terminals is increased in jnk-1 and jkk-1 mutants, which remains unknown, it might explain our results. Whether MIG-15 and NSY-1 are involved in ARL-8 regulation of synaptic position like JKK-1 and JNK-1 remains an open question.\\n\\nWe have found that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway specifically suppresses synapse formation defects in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants. This differs from prior work showing the DLK-1/PMK-3 and MLK-1/KGB-1 pathways suppress both axon termination and synapse formation defects in mechanosensory neurons, as well as synapse formation defects in motor neurons of rpm-1 mutants [29, 30]. Because mechanosensory neurons form glutamatergic, neuron-neuron synapses that are reminiscent of mammalian central synapses, it is reasonable to speculate that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway might regulate central synapse formation in other organisms.\\n\\nRecent studies suggested axon termination defects are a remodeling phenotype that occurs due to retraction of the PLM synaptic branch [59, 66]. This is one possible explanation for why mutants, such as rpm-1, affect both axon termination and synapse formation. However, if this were true, we would expect genetic changes to affect both axon termination and synapse formation in all cases. Our discovery of the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway demonstrates distinct signals exist within the mechanosensory neurons that differentially influence chemical synapse formation compared to axon termination.\\n\\nAccompanying differing effects of the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway and the DLK-1/PMK-3 pathway on synapse development are differing results on habituation to tap, a form of short-term learning, that is dependent upon chemical synapse function in the mechanosensory neurons. Prior work showed rpm-1 mutants have dramatic defects in habituation to repeated tap stimulus, which is suppressed by dlk-1 [23]. Defects in habituation stem from RPM-1 function in the mechanosensory neurons. We have found nsy-1, jkk-1 and jnk-1 also suppress habituation defects in rpm-1 mutants. However, there were important differences between these kinases and DLK-1. First, jkk-1 and jnk-1 single mutants have increased habituation (Fig 10B and 10C), which was not observed in dlk-1 mutants [23]. Second, our results show that double mutants of rpm-1 with jnk-1, jkk-1 or nsy-1 are suppressed to an intermediate habituation phenotype with neither phenotype from single mutants dominating. The most likely explanation for these results is that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1 (Fig 10E, Model 2). This differs from the DLK-1/PMK-3 pathway, which is inhibited by RPM-1 [29]. While we favor the parallel opposing pathway interpretation of our data, it is important to note our genetic results do not rule out that RPM-1 might ubiquitinate and inhibit a kinase in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway, in which case the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway would function downstream of RPM-1 (Fig 10E, Model 1).\\n\\nOur finding that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is likely to function as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1 indicates that RPM-1 could be a relatively specific inhibitor of certain p38 and JNK pathways. This is consistent with prior work showing RPM-1 binds to the PP2C phosphatase PPM-2 to specifically inhibit DLK-1 [27]. Thus, our findings continue to support the concept that RPM-1 is a relatively sophisticated regulator of intracellular signaling, and not simply a general silencer of MAPK signaling [15, 27].\\n\\nOur discoveries that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway inhibits glutamatergic synapse formation, and that impairing certain kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway increases short-term learning have potentially important implications for neurodegenerative disease. This is particularly noteworthy, as a JNK inhibitor was shown to reduce synaptic dysfunction and improve cognitive outcomes in mouse models of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease [41\\u201343], and recent work showed genetically impairing JNK activation improves outcomes in ALS and Alzheimer\\u2019s models [44]. The specificity of the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway compared to the DLK-1/PMK-3 and MLK-1/KGB-1 pathways in worms suggests inhibitors of specific JNK isoforms could have differing efficacy in neurodegenerative disease models.\\n\\nThe N2 isolate of C. elegans was used for all experiments and worms were maintained using standard procedures. The following mutant alleles were used in this study: rpm-1 (ju44), jnk-1 (gk7), jkk-1 (km2), nsy-1 (ok593), and mig-15 (mu342). Genotyping was done by PCR and restriction digestion. nsy-1 (ok593) was maintained as a balanced strain with mIn1. mig-15 mutants were maintained at 20\\u00b0C and shifted to 23\\u00b0C for experiments. The MosSCI insertion strain EG6699, tTi5605 (Mos1 transposon on chromosome II); unc-119 (ed3), was used to generate the integrated transgene bggSi1 [Pmec-7MIG-15) that was used for mig-15 rescue experiments.\\n\\nOther integrated transgenes used included: muIs32 [Pmec-7::GFP] II, jsIs1114 [Pmec-7GFP::RAB-3] II, jsIs973 [Pmec-7mRFP] III, juIs1 [Punc-25SNB-1::GFP] IV and bggIs28 [Pmec-7::UNC-10::tdTOMATO] III.\\n\\ncDNA encoding jnk-1, jkk-1, nsy-1 or mig-15 were cloned with iProof High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (BIO-RAD) PCR from an N2 cDNA pool using standard conditions. cDNAs were Taq polished and TOPO cloned into pCR8 Gateway entry vector (Invitrogen). cDNA entry vectors were validated by sequencing and recombined into the necessary Gateway destination vectors to create final plasmids for microinjection or transfection into HEK 293 cells.\\n\\nFor construction of Pmec-7::UNC-10::tdTOMATO (pBG-GY757), tdTOMATO cDNA was initially subcloned by PCR, adding PpuMI and NheI sites to 5\\u2019 and 3\\u2019 ends, respectively. These enzyme sites were used to insert tdTOMATO into a Pmec-7 Gateway destination vector to create the C-terminal tagging vector pBG-GY747. unc-10 genomic DNA was TOPO cloned using pJH430 (kind gift of Dr. Mei Zhen, University of Toronto) as a PCR template, and recombined into pBG-GY747.\\n\\nTo build a targeting vector for mig-15 MosSCI insertion, the pCR8 mig-15 Gateway entry vector (pBG-GY596) was recombined with a Pmec-7 destination vector (pBG-GY119). The mec-7 promoter, mig-15 cDNA, and unc-54 3\\u2019UTR was amplified by PCR as a single sequence using iProof DNA polymerase. SpeI sites were included in the primers and added to the 5\\u2019 and 3\\u2019 ends of this construct. PCR product was TOPO cloned into pCR8 to create pBG-GY616 and verified by sequencing. pBG-GY616 plasmid was cut with SpeI and subcloned into the pCFJ350 MosSCI targeting vector.\\n\\nTransgenic strains were derived using standard procedures. For mechanosensory neuron rescue experiments, plasmid DNA mixtures were injected in double mutants of interest with muIs32 to derive transgenic extrachromosomal arrays that used the mec-7 promoter to drive expression from jnk-1, jkk-1 or nsy-1 cDNA. mig-15 rescue was done using a MosSCI single copy integrated transgene, bggSi1, that was crossed onto rpm-1 (ju44); mig-15 (mu342) double mutants. MosSCI was necessary due to technical limitations of injecting into mig-15 mutants, which have small body and brood size. MosSCI insertion was carried out with peel-1 negative selection [67].\\n\\nFor overexpression experiments, kinase cDNAs were expressed using the pan-neuronal rgef-1 promoter and extrachromasomal arrays were derived using wild-type animals. PCR amplification was performed using the Roche Expand Long Template PCR system.\\n\\nFor localization experiments, transgenic extrachromosomal arrays were generated in wild-type animals by injecting plasmids that used the mec-3 or mec-7 promoter to express nsy-1 or jnk-1 cDNA with N-terminal GFP fusions. For colocalization, GFP::JNK-1 was injected into bggIs28. The bggIs28 transgene was generated by TMP/UV genomic integration of a transgenic array containing Pmec-7::UNC-10::tdTOMATO (injected at 25 ng/\\u03bcL). We generated N and C-terminal GFP and tdTOMATO fusions with MIG-15 and JKK-1, but these constructs were not readily detected in PLM neurons across different injection concentrations using either the mec-3 or mec-7 promoters.\\n\\nAll injection mixes used to make extrachromasomal arrays included the co-injection marker Pmyo-2::mCherry at 1 ng/\\u03bcL, and were made up to total DNA concentration of 100 ng/\\u03bcL using pBluescript. S1 Table contains information for DNA concentrations for all individual injections. DNA was microinjected with using Zeiss AxioObserver.A1 microscope, Shutter Instrument XenoWorks Digital Microinjector and NARISHIGE MO-202U micromanipulator and standard injection procedures.\\n\\nPLM axon termination and synaptic branch morphology was analyzed and quantified using the transgene muIs32. L4 parent worms were grown at 23\\u00b0C and F1 progeny were picked to separate plates as L4 animals and maintained at 23\\u00b0C. Animals were scored or imaged 16\\u201324 hours later as young adults. This procedure was used to ensure consistent developmental staging across genotypes. Animals were anesthetized in 5 \\u03bcM levamisole or 1% (v/v) 1-phenoxy-2-propanol in M9 buffer on a 2% agarose pad, and mounted and visualized with a Leica DM5000 B (CTR5000) epifluorescence microscope using 40x or 63x oil immersion objectives. Images were acquired with a CCD Leica DFC345 FX camera.\\n\\nThe synaptic branch was scored as a proxy for synapse formation in the PLM neurons. Defects were scored by following PLM synaptic branches down to the ventral nerve cord (VNC). Branches with terminal GFP varicosities, representing presynaptic boutons, were scored as wildtype. The absence of terminal varicosities and incomplete branches, or total absence of branches were scored as mutant. A subset of mig-15 mutants had multiple collateral PLM branches, a phenotype previously documented in the DD motor neurons for mig-15 mutants [48]. If at least one complete branch reached the VNC to form a varicosity the neuron was not counted as mutant for synaptic branch. The position of the vulva was also used to assess which branch was the normal, wild-type synaptic branch in these animals. A small proportion of mig-15 mutants displayed severe migration and guidance problems; the PLM neurons from these neurons were not included in our analysis.\\n\\nTo score PLM neurons simultaneously expressing Pmec-7::GFP::RAB-3 (jsIs1114) and Pmec-7::mRFP (jsIs973), the same criteria for the synaptic branch was used as above, but the presence of GFP::RAB-3 puncta was scored simultaneously. Whenever GFP::RAB-3 puncta were observed at the presynaptic terminal, the PLM synaptic branch and presynaptic bouton morphology were also normal.\\n\\nAxon termination was scored as mutant if the axon overextended beyond the normal termination point (prior to the ALM cell body) and curved towards the VNC. These defects were referred to as \\u201chook\\u201d defects.\\n\\nTo evaluate synapse formation in the GABAergic motor neurons, we used the transgene Punc-25::SNB-1::GFP (juIs1). Analysis of SNB-1::GFP puncta was done on young adult worms grown at 25\\u00b0C. Worms were prepared for analysis as described for the PLM neurons, and anesthetized with 1% (v/v) 1-phoxy-2-propanol. Images of the dorsal cord were collected using a 40x oil immersion objective. Stretches of dorsal cord were measured using Leica Application Suite AF software, and the number of SNB-1::GFP puncta were manually counted.\\n\\nL4 worms were picked to a separate plate and young adults were imaged 18\\u201324 hours later. Slides were prepared with the same procedure described for PLM analysis with cytosolic GFP using 5 \\u03bcM levamisole. Coverslips were sealed with BIOTIUM CoverGrip Coverslip Sealant. Confocal images were collected with Leica SP8 confocal microscope under 25x or 40x objectives. The following acquisition conditions were used: Bidirectional, 1.00 AU pinhole, 2.5\\u20133.0x scan zoom factor, 400-600Hz, HyD detectors, 150\\u2013200 gain, 512x512 format, between lines sequential acquisition. Analysis conditions were kept identical across genotypes. Leica Application Suite (LAS) software was used to define Z-stacks that were collected at 1.0 to 1.5\\u03bcm intervals. Maximum intensity projections of Z-stacks were made using LAS software.\\n\\nExported TIFF files of confocal stacks were analyzed in FIJI (ImageJ). Regions of interest (ROI) were defined manually for GFP::RAB-3 and UNC-10::tdTOMATO puncta within PLM presynaptic boutons. Mean area and number of puncta were calculated based on ROIs, and data was pooled from three separate experiments for each genotype.\\n\\nColchicine (0.25 mM from a 0.5 M stock solution dissolved in DMSO) was added while pouring NGM plates. Control NGM plates were made by adding an equal volume of DMSO. OP50 bacteria lawns were seeded onto colchicine or DMSO plates and used within 10 days of pouring. P0 young adult worms were placed on colchicine or DMSO plates, and F1 young adults were analyzed.\\n\\n6-cm dishes of confluent HEK 293-T cells were transfected with 10 \\u03bcL of Lipofectamine using the designated amount of plasmid: pBG-GY711 (FLAG-NSY-1, 2 \\u03bcg), pBG-GY738 (MIG-15-HA, 4 \\u03bcg) and pBG-GY784 (HA-JKK-1, 4 \\u03bcg). pBluescript was added to reach 8 \\u03bcg of total DNA transfected per plate. 22\\u201326 hrs after transfection, cells were lysed with 0.1% NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1x Pierce HALT protease inhibitor cocktail). 0.25 to 0.5 mg of total protein from transfected cells was used for coIPs. Lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 30 min and precipitated for 4 h with 10 \\u03bcL protein G agarose (Roche Applied Science) at 4\\u00b0C. Precipitates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with \\u00df-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and run on a 4\\u201312% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Gels were transferred to PVDF membranes using Tris acetate transfer buffer and immunoblotted. Blots were visualized with HRP conjugated secondary antibodies, ECL (1:5 dilution of Supersignal West Femto (Thermo Scientific) in TBS) and x-ray film.\\n\\nFLAG tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma), and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (Cell Signaling). HA tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted with a rabbit monoclonal anti-HA antibody (C29F4, Cell Signaling). For anti-HA blots, anti-rabbit light chain specific secondary antibodies were used.\\n\\nTap habituation experiments were performed as described previously with minor modifications [23]. Behavioral recordings were collected using a modified Multi-Worm Tracker. Age-synchronized animals (~50\\u2013100) were cultivated from egg until gravid adult (~3 days) at 23\\u00b0C, and assayed on 5 cm NGM plates with 50 \\u03bcl of OP50 E. coli. Behavior of animals was recorded for 550 seconds, and animals were mechanically stimulated by tapping the side of the plate with an automated linear solenoid after the first 100 seconds. Plates were tapped 45 times with a 10 second inter-stimulus interval. Response was measured as reversal probability, which was estimated by the proportion of worms that reversed within 2 seconds of each tap stimulus. Because reversal probabilities to the initial response differed in some genotypes (mean \\u00b1 SEM, Fig 10B: wildtype = 0.90 \\u00b1 0.01, rpm-1 = 0.98 \\u00b1 0.01, jnk-1 = 0.78 \\u00b1 0.03, rpm-1; jnk-1 = 0.53 \\u00b1 0.03; Fig 10C: wildtype = 0.89 \\u00b1 0.02, rpm-1 = 0.96 \\u00b1 0.01, jkk-1 = 0.81 \\u00b1 0.02, rpm-1; jkk-1 = 0.75 \\u00b1 0.01; and Fig 10D: wildtype = 0.90 \\u00b1 0.01, rpm-1 = 0.93 \\u00b1 0.01, nsy-1 = 0.80 \\u00b1 0.02, rpm-1; nsy-1 = 0.82 \\u00b1 0.02), responses were standardized as the percent mean of initial response. For each plate, exponential curves were fit to the responses across stimuli, and habituation level was measured as the value of the fit at the final stimulus. All strains used contained the muIs32 transgene.\\n\",\n          \"The accuracy by which DNA polymerases synthesize DNA is essential for maintaining genome stability and preventing carcinogenesis. Eukaryotes utilize many DNA polymerases, with different properties, during DNA replication and in DNA repair [1]. DNA polymerase \\u03b4 (Pol \\u03b4), DNA polymerase \\u03b5 (Pol \\u03b5) and DNA polymerase \\u03b1 (Pol \\u03b1) (with associated primase activity) are required for bulk synthesis of DNA during chromosomal replication [2]. Several studies have suggested that there is a division of labor between Pol \\u03b4 and Pol \\u03b5 at the replication fork. Genetic and biochemical studies position Pol \\u03b4 on the lagging strand [3]\\u2013[6], whereas Pol \\u03b5 was shown to participate in the synthesis of the leading strand in S. cerevisiae [7]. These studies were preceded by genetic experiments showing that Pol \\u03b5 and Pol \\u03b4 proofread opposite strands [8]\\u2013[10]. In addition, the Pol \\u03b5 3\\u2032\\u2192 5\\u2032 \\u2013exonuclease activity, contrary to the Pol \\u03b4 3\\u2032\\u2192 5\\u2032 \\u2013exonuclease activity, does not participate in the correction of errors made by Pol \\u03b1. This suggests that the proofreading function of Pol \\u03b5 is restricted to the leading strand [11], while the exonuclease activity of Pol \\u03b4, or perhaps another exonuclease, may proofread both strands [12].\\n\\nThe organization of the replication fork during normal DNA replication, with Pol \\u03b5 on the leading strand and Pol \\u03b4 on the lagging strand [6], [7], can be disrupted by DNA lesions or sequence contexts in an undamaged template that influence the ability of the replicative polymerase to remain processive [12]\\u2013[14]. When polymerases dissociate, the replication machinery must accommodate to complete the replication process and if possible maintain high fidelity. To accomplish this, a variety of strategies are used, including translesion synthesis and recombination pathways [15]. DNA lesions which disengage Pol \\u03b4 or Pol \\u03b5 result in single-stranded gaps which are filled in during post-replication repair [16]\\u2013[18]. Furthermore, biochemical experiments have shown that collisions between DNA polymerase and transcribing RNA polymerase leads to the abortion of DNA synthesis followed by a reinitiation event when the RNA transcript is used as a primer [19]. To summarize, post-replication repair processes, uncoupled from the replication fork, are likely to occur on both leading and lagging strands to complete DNA replication.\\n\\nPol \\u03b1, Pol \\u03b4 and Pol \\u03b5 are all composed of several subunits encoded by separate genes. Besides the catalytic subunit, Pol2 (256 kDa), yeast Pol \\u03b5 consists of three auxiliary subunits, Dpb2 (79 kDa), Dpb3 (23 kDa) and Dpb4 (22 kDa) [20]. DPB2 is an essential gene in yeast with an unknown function [21], yet it is required for early steps in DNA replication and is regulated by Cdc28 kinase [22], [23]. Recently dpb2 mutations that increase spontaneous mutagenesis were found in S. cerevisiae, suggesting that the second subunit contributes to the fidelity of DNA replication by an unknown mechanism [24], [25]. DPB3 and DPB4 are non-essential genes. Deletion of DPB3 was previously shown to result in a modest mutator effect [26], [27]. Dpb3 and Dpb4 both contain histone fold motifs that are known to be important in protein-protein interactions [28], [29]. Interestingly, Dpb4 is a component of a chromatin-remodeling complex in S. cerevisiae, ISW2, corresponding to the CHRAC complex found in Drosophila and humans [30], [31].\\n\\nThe structure of the Pol \\u03b5 holoenzyme revealed two large domains separated by a flexible hinge [32]. It was suggested that the tail domain of Pol \\u03b5 was comprised of the Dpb2, Dpb3 and Dpb4 subunits and was important for the binding to and association with the primer-template dsDNA during DNA synthesis [32]. A purified Dpb3-Dpb4 heterodimer was shown to possess dsDNA binding properties, which in part could explain the properties of the tail-domain [29]. However, this does not exclude the possibility that Dpb2 by itself has properties which allow the tail-domain to interact with dsDNA even without Dpb3 and Dpb4.\\n\\nIn this work, we address whether the Dpb3 and Dpb4 subunits have an effect on the biochemical properties of Pol \\u03b5 and the fidelity of replication in yeast via a function at the tail-domain of Pol \\u03b5. We find that Dpb3 and Dpb4 are important for the processivity of Pol \\u03b5 polymerase and exonuclease activities, suggesting a role of these two subunits in stabilization of Pol \\u03b5 interaction with primer-template DNA. Evidently this indirectly affects the fidelity of the overall DNA replication process, since deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 increases both spontaneous frameshift and base substitution mutagenesis, despite an unchanged fidelity of the purified Pol2/Dpb2 complex. A genetic analysis suggests that REV3 contributes to the increased mutation rate in dpb3\\u0394dpb4\\u0394 and the mutational intermediates escape correction by the mismatch repair system.\\n\\nTo investigate the in vivo role of the Pol \\u03b5 accessory subunits Dpb3 and Dpb4, we constructed yeast strains wherein either DPB3, DPB4 or both of these genes were deleted. The frequency of spontaneous mutations in these strains was measured in two reversion assays and one forward mutation assay. We studied the his7-2 and lys2::insE-A14 reversion alleles to score frameshift mutations. The his7-2 allele contains a single base pair deletion in a run of 8 T(A) and revert via +1 insertions or -2 deletions [33]. The lys2::insE-A14 allele contains a homonucleotide run of 14 T(A) and revert mainly via -1 mutations [34]. The forward mutation assay scores various types of mutations that inactivate the CAN1 gene and result in resistance to canavanine. We found that the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 double deletion has a moderate mutator effect in all assays. Mutation rates for his7-2 reversions and lys2::insE-A14 were increased 2.7 and 2.6-fold when compared to the wt E134 strain (Table 1). The mutation rate in the forward mutation assay for canavanine resistance was increased 7.4-fold compared to the wt strain (Table 1). The individual contribution of dpb3\\u0394 or dpb4\\u0394 was comparable to the effect of the deletion of both these genes (dpb3\\u0394dpb4\\u0394) (Table 1). A proofreading deficient allele of the catalytic subunit, pol2-4, introduced in the same genetic background resulted in an elevation of the mutation rates similar to the dpb3\\u0394dpb4\\u0394 strain (Table 1).\\n\\nTo determine if the participation of Pol \\u03b5 in DNA replication depends on DPB3 and DPB4, we combined dpb3\\u0394, dpb4\\u0394, or dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 with the pol2-4 mutation. The analysis revealed different genetic interactions. Combining dpb3\\u0394 and pol2-4 led to an additive effect on his7-2 reversion (Table 1). A higher than additive increase in mutation rate was observed with the his7-2 allele when pol2-4 was combined with dpb4\\u0394 or dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 (Table 1). Reversions scored in the lys2::insE-A14 allele revealed a close to epistatic interaction between pol2-4, dpb3\\u0394, dpb4\\u0394, and dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 (Table 1). The pol2-4 mutation itself elevated the reversion rate of the lys2::insE-A14 allele 2.7-fold, which agrees with previous results [35], [36]. The forward mutation assay with the CAN1 gene revealed an additive effect of the pol2-4 mutation and the double dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 deletion. An additive interaction was also found in the pol2-4dpb3\\u0394 strain, but the combination of pol2-4 and dpb4\\u0394 gave a higher than additive increase in mutation frequency (Table 1). The disparate genetic interactions of DPB3 and DPB4 with the proofreading activity of Pol2 could be due to the separate function of Dpb4 in a chromatin remodeling complex, ISW2 [30], [31], [37], [38]. However, there are no reports demonstrating that ISW2 influence the mutation rate in S. cerevisiae. Another possibility could be that Dpb3 and Dpb4 influence the fidelity of DNA synthesis by Pol \\u03b5.\\n\\nTo measure the fidelity of Pol \\u03b5 lacking Dpb3/Dpb4, we purified the wild type (i.e., exonuclease proficient) Pol2/Dpb2 complex and the exonuclease deficient pol2-4/Dpb2 complex, and then measured their fidelity in an M13mp2 gap-filling assay [39]. The lacZ mutant frequency of the DNA synthesis reaction products generated by the wild type Pol2/Dpb2 complex was 0.0018, comparable to the previously reported value of 0.0019 for the four-subunit Pol \\u03b5 [40]. Both values are near the background lacZ mutant frequency of uncopied DNA, indicating that the exonuclease proficient Pol2/Dpb2 complex is highly accurate. The pol2-4/Dpb2 complex was less accurate, as expected because it is proofreading deficient. However, it was no less accurate than the exonuclease-deficient 4-subunit holoenzyme, as indicated by the similar lacZ mutant frequencies observed for both complexes (Table 2). To analyze if the error specificity of the 2-subunit enzyme differed from that of the holoenzyme, we sequenced 277 independent mutants generated by pol2-4/Dpb2, and compared the results to those reported in an earlier study [40] of 285 lacZ mutants generated by the holoenzyme. Comparable error specificity was observed (Table 2) for substitutions, frameshifts and other mutations. We conclude that the increased mutation rates in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain is unlikely to be due to a lower fidelity of DNA synthesis by Pol \\u03b5 per se.\\n\\nThe REV3 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase \\u03b6 (Pol \\u03b6), which is known to be a major contributor to both spontaneous and DNA damage inducible mutagenesis in wild type strains and in strains with defects in other DNA polymerases [27], [41], [42]. Yeast Pol \\u03b6 has relatively high fidelity for single-base insertions and deletions, and somewhat lower fidelity for base substitutions [43]. Deletion of the REV3 gene suppresses mutagenesis in CAN1 in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain but not mutagenesis in the his7-2 or lys2::insE-A14 allele (Table 3). Thus, the increase in frameshift mutagenesis observed in the his7-2 and lys2::insE-A14 alleles is Pol \\u03b6-independent.The independence of frameshift his7-2 and lys2::insE-A14 reversion from Pol \\u03b6 is consistent with an earlier observation that replication defects (e.g. in Pol \\u03b4 mutant, the pol3-Y708allele) cause Pol \\u03b6 dependent mutagenesis for base substitutions only [44].\\n\\nPublished results suggest that Pol \\u03b4 can proofread errors made by Pol \\u03b1 [11]. To ask if Pol \\u03b4 proofreads errors generated in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain, we combined the proofreading deficient Pol \\u03b4 allele pol3-5DV with dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394. The pol3-5DV dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain was viable, in contrast to pol3-01 pol2-4 and pol3-5DV pol2-4 haploid strains [9]. The mutation rates in pol3-5DV dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 and pol3-5DV in the CAN1 gene were similar (Table 1). In contrast, the reversion rate of the his7-2 allele was greater than additive in the pol3-5DV dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain, when compared to the pol3-5DV strain and dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain. We conclude that Pol \\u03b4 has the capacity to proofread a fraction of frameshift errors that occur in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain, but there could also be some other 3\\u2032\\u21925\\u2032 exonuclease that participates in the process.\\n\\nThe mismatch repair protein Msh6 is involved in recognizing a subset of replication errors, specifically single base mismatches and small insertion-deletion intermediates [45]. Although less severe than msh2\\u0394, pms1\\u0394 or mlh1\\u0394, inactivation of the MSH6 gene results in a strong increase in mutagenesis (Table 4). For instance, msh6\\u0394 leads to a dramatic increase of lys2::insE-A14 allele reversion rates as a result of single nucleotide deletions (Table 4, [34], [35]). To ask whether DPB3 and DPB4 interact with the mismatch repair system we measured the mutation rates in strains with dpb3\\u0394 and dpb4\\u0394 deletions in an Msh6-deficient background to score for base-base mismatches and small insertion-deletion errors.\\n\\nThe combination of the msh6\\u0394 with the dpb3\\u0394 and dpb4\\u0394 gave an additive increase in the his7-2 reversion and can1 mutation rates (Table 1). The strong synergetic interaction between proofreading defects (pol2-4, pol3-01) and defects in the mismatch repair system was previously observed for short homopolymeric runs and base substitutions, but not for long homopolymeric runs, such as the A14 run in the lys2::insE-A14 allele [34], [35], [46]. In agreement with that, we observed a synergetic interaction between pol2-4 and msh6\\u0394 when mutation rates in a pol2-4 msh6\\u0394 strain were estimated in the his7-2 and CAN1 loci (Table 1). In the short 8A run of the his7-2 allele, neither the deletion of DPB3 or DPB4 nor both genes affected the mutation rate of the pol2-4 msh6\\u0394. The multiplicative interaction of pol2-4 and dpb4\\u0394 is absent in the msh6\\u0394 background. The mutation rate in the lys2::insE-A14 gave a complex interaction between msh6\\u0394 and dpb3\\u0394 and dpb4\\u0394. The mutation rate was somewhat lower (though not statistically significant, see overlapping confidence limits in Table 1) when either dpb3\\u0394 or dpb4\\u0394 was combined with msh6\\u0394, than when the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 was combined with msh6\\u0394. When pol2-4 was added to the msh6\\u0394 strain, the combination with dpb3\\u0394, dpb4\\u0394 or dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 gave a mutation rate that was one third of the mutation rate in the pol2-4 msh6\\u0394 strain. At present, it is not clear why this small reduction in mutation rate occurs.\\n\\nThe lack of a synergetic interaction between dpb3\\u0394, dpb4\\u0394 and msh6\\u0394 was unexpected and led us to ask if this was also true for other genes that are required for mismatch repair. Msh2 forms a heterodimer with either Msh3 or Msh6. Thus, msh6\\u0394 strains still have active Msh2-Msh3 which corrects most replication errors. To completely abolish mismatch repair we deleted MSH2, MLH1, or PMS1. The combination of mlh1\\u0394 or pms1\\u0394 with dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 did not reveal a strong synergetic interaction on the his7-2 reversion or can1 mutation rates (Table 4). The combination of msh2\\u0394 and dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 gave only a two-fold increase in mutation rate on his7-2 reversions and no increase on can1 mutation rates. These data indicate that dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 do not act in series with the mismatch repair system.\\n\\nForward mutations giving resistance to canavanine can arise by many different mechanisms. Earlier studies have shown that even a small collection of sequenced can1 mutants can reveal significant changes in the mutation spectra (e.g. upon deletion of POL32, a small subunit of Pol \\u03b4, or inactivation of Pol \\u03b5 proofreading with the pol2-4 allele [9], [47]). To analyze if the deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 might drastically influence the distribution of types of mutations in the CAN1 gene, we sequenced 48 can1 mutants in four isogenic strains: wt, dpb3\\u0394dpb4\\u0394, pol2-4 and pol2-4 dpb3\\u0394dpb4\\u0394 (Table 5). The difference between strains carrying the pol2-4 allele and carrying POL2 was statistically significant according to a modified Pearson \\u03c72 test of spectra homogeneity (see Table S1 and Table S2). There was a characteristic reduction of CG\\u2192GC changes and an increase of frameshift mutations in the pol2-4 spectrum (Table 5). The comparison between wt and dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 or pol2-4 and pol2-4 dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 showed that the deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 did not give a statistically significant alteration in mutation spectra (see Table S1). The sample size was insufficient to demonstrate the enhancement of an error signature for Pol \\u03b6 despite the increased contribution of REV3 dependent mutations in CAN1. We conclude that the CAN1 mutations appearing in the pol2-4 background and in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 mutants arise by different mechanisms.\\n\\nThe contribution of Pol \\u03b6 to the elevated mutation rates suggested that a Pol2/Dpb2 complex does not support a fully functional replisome. To ask if Dpb3 and Dpb4 influence the processivity of Pol \\u03b5, we purified a Pol2/Dpb2 complex with an intact polymerase and exonuclease activity. We measured the processivity of the polymerase activity on a singly-primed, single stranded circular DNA template under single-hit conditions [48]. We found that a 40-fold molar excess of the primer-template over Pol \\u03b5 and a 20-fold molar excess of the primer-template over Pol2/Dpb2 fit the criteria for single-hit conditions. The processivity of Pol \\u03b5 on this template was comparable to a previous report, with a strong pause-site 63 nucleotides from the primer (Figure 1B) [48]. The absence of Dpb3 and Dpb4 from Pol \\u03b5 lowers the processivity of polymerization. Some products reached a length of 63 nucleotides, but products were terminated with a higher probability at numerous positions (Figure 1C). On average, the termination probability at each position on the template increased two to three-fold for Pol2/Dpb2 as compared to the four subunit Pol \\u03b5.\\n\\nNext, we asked if the Dpb3 and Dpb4 subunits are required for processive exonucleolytic degradation of DNA. We carried out an exonuclease assay with a 57-nt long primer annealed to a 75-nt long template to generate 57-nt dsDNA region. Again, the conditions were empirically determined to achieve single-hit kinetics. This time a five-fold molar excess of primer-template over the four-subunit Pol \\u03b5 was used, whereas an equimolar ratio of primer-template and enzyme was used for Pol2/Dpb2. We found that the Pol \\u03b5 holoenzyme efficiently degraded the first 24 nucleotides of the primer (Figure 2B). At this point only \\u223c32 nt of the primer remained. This correlates well with the minimal length of dsDNA required for processive synthesis of DNA by Pol \\u03b5 [32]. By analogy, the processivity of Pol \\u03b5 exonuclease activity could depend on a specific interaction between the tail-domain and the dsDNA. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found the exonuclease activity of Pol2/Dpb2 to be less processive. Very few primers were degraded further than 11 nucleotides. On average, the termination probability at each position on the primer increased two to three-fold for Pol2/Dpb2 as compared to four-subunit Pol \\u03b5 (Figure 2C). In addition, the absence of Dpb3 and Dpb4 did not result in a general inactivation of the exonuclease activity, since the exonuclease activity of the Pol2/Dpb2 complex and four-subunit Pol \\u03b5 was comparable on single-stranded DNA (data not shown). We conclude that Dpb3 and Dpb4 stabilize the interaction of Pol \\u03b5 with primer-template DNA and therefore positively affect the processivity of the polymerase and exonuclease activities of Pol \\u03b5. The removal of Dpb3 and Dpb4 would then lead to frequent dissociation of Pol \\u03b5 that may disrupt the synthesis of the leading strand and potentially result in single-strand gaps.\\n\\nIn general, defects at the replication fork which give higher mutation rates act in series when combined with an inactivated mismatch repair system, i.e. mutator alleles of the catalytic subunit of Pol \\u03b1, Pol \\u03b4, and Pol \\u03b5, temperature sensitive mutations of DPB2 (subunit of Pol \\u03b5), rfa1-29t, or the rfc1::Tn3 allele (subunit of clamp loader) [9], [24], [25], [49]\\u2013[52]. The interpretation has been that errors made in the proximity of the replication fork are corrected by mismatch repair and this results in a synergistic increase in mutation rates when mismatch repair is inactivated. In this study we show that deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 have the unique property among replication fork associated genes to give an increased mutation rate, but do not act in series with the mismatch repair system.\\n\\nThe unaltered fidelity of the Pol2/Dpb2 complex suggested that Dpb3 and Dpb4 are not important for the fidelity of DNA synthesis by Pol \\u03b5 per se. In contrast, our genetic analysis demonstrated that the inactivation of DPB3 and DPB4 in yeast elevates the mutation rates comparable to the proofreading deficient pol2-4 allele of Pol \\u03b5. This suggests that the dynamics of the replication fork was altered in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain and the defect influenced the fidelity of the replisome. The hypothesis was supported by the observation that a Pol2/Dpb2 complex (lacking Dpb3 and Dpb4) was less processive both when polymerizing new DNA and degrading DNA (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\\n\\nRecently, it was shown that Pol \\u03b6 participates in the synthesis on undamaged DNA templates during defective replisome-induced mutagenesis as well as synthesis on stretches of single-stranded DNA carrying DNA lesions [42], [53]. Our genetic analysis supports a role for Pol \\u03b4 and Pol \\u03b6 in spontaneous mutagenesis in dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strains since the mutagenesis in CAN1 depends in part on Pol \\u03b6 and Pol \\u03b4 proofreading suppresses mutations in his7-2. One explanation for our observations could be that Pol \\u03b5 dissociates more frequently from the template when DPB3 and DPB4 are deleted. After reinitiation, a gap is left that will be filled in by a post-replication repair mechanism analogous to what might happen when a replicative polymerase encounters a DNA lesion that cannot be bypassed. During this process, there will be time for the 3\\u2032-end to repeatedly melt and reanneal. A short homonucleotide run at the his7-2 site may frequently reanneal at the wrong nucleotide creating 1 or 2 nt loops. Such errors could be corrected by proofreading by the replicative polymerases [34] and the presence of Exo+ Pol \\u03b4 during the gap-filling process would lead to decreased level of mutations. In a pol3-5DV strain, this proofreading is absent leading to a more than additive increase in mutation rate. In this scenario, we detect errors that appear not because of synthetic errors by Pol \\u03b5 but instead due to an intermediate DNA structure that is prone to frameshift mutations. Thus a greater than additive interaction could be expected because Pol \\u03b5 without Dpb3 and Dpb4 and proofreading by Pol \\u03b4 act in series. The effect is detected because of the property of the reversion assay, which focuses on a single mutational pathway. We do not observe the same effects in the CAN1 gene because, in this case, we detect mutations generated by many different pathways. There is, however, a strong synergetic interaction between pol3-5DV and inactivation of mismatch repair. This can easily be explained by the proofreading deficiency of pol3-5DV that generates errors on the lagging strand at the replication fork. In addition, pol3-5DV is a mutator allele due to a defect in Okazaki fragment maturation [54]. Because of the multiple roles of Pol \\u03b4 and its proofreading activity, more experiments are required to establish the nature of the effect of the pol3-5DV that we observed for his7-2 reversion.\\n\\nThe deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 could also result in lesser overall DNA synthesis by Pol \\u03b5 on the leading strand. This is not likely to be the case as the mutation rate in the pol2-4 strain is not higher than in the pol2-4 dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain and the mutation signature from pol2-4 in the CAN1 gene is also found in the pol2-4 dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain, suggesting that exonuclease deficient pol2 synthesize approximately the same amount of DNA regardless if Dpb3 and Dpb4 are present or not.\\n\\nIt was earlier shown that defective replicative DNA polymerases (encoded by pol1-1, pol2-1, pol3t and pol3-Y708A) lead to an increased mutation rate that is in part dependent on Pol \\u03b6. To our knowledge, the in vitro fidelity of the enzymes encoded by the four mutant alleles, pol1-1, pol2-1, pol3t and pol3-Y708A has not been measured. Thus, it is not firmly established if these alleles replicate DNA with a reduced fidelity. It is however, plausible that pol3-Y708A has a reduced fidelity based on analogous mutations in the Klenow fragment and RB69 DNA polymerase (discussed in [44]) and the position of Tyr708 in the active site [55]. The pol3-t mutant has a temperature sensitive mutation that also may affect the polymerase site and alter the fidelity of Pol3 [44], [55]. In cases where the effect of mismatch repair has been studied, clear synergy was observed for pol1-1 [56], pol3-t [57] and pol3-Y708A [44]. Mutant alleles encoding for polymerases that by itself synthesize DNA with a higher error-rate are likely to show synergy with the inactivation of mismatch repair, even if a substantial part of the mutations in the strain are REV3 dependent. The dual mechanism of mutator effects are exemplified by pol3-Y708A, which is likely to encode a polymerase that both generate errors that are corrected by mismatch repair and also induce PCNA ubiquitylation and a Pol \\u03b6 dependent increase of mutation rates. Here we present, for the first time, data on a mutant possessing two-subunit Pol \\u03b5 with a confirmed unchanged error-rate in vitro, and a Pol \\u03b6 dependent increase in mutation rates, but no observed synergy with the inactivation of mismatch repair. This observation provides a distinction of errors made at the replication fork from errors made during postreplication DNA synthesis.\\n\\nThe deletions of DPB3 and DPB4 led to an increased mutation rate but did not act in series with msh6\\u0394, msh2\\u0394, pms1\\u0394 or mlh1\\u0394. The lack of synergy could be due to an essential function for DPB3 or DPB4 in mismatch repair that inactivates the mismatch repair system. It was proposed earlier that the 3\\u2032\\u2192 5\\u2032exonuclease activity of Pol \\u03b5 could be involved in the excision step of mismatch repair in yeast [35]. However, the reversion rate at the lys2::insE-A14 allele in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain is too low to support a role for DPB3 and DPB4 in mismatch repair (compare dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 with msh6\\u0394, msh2\\u0394, pms1\\u0394 or mlh1\\u0394 (Table 1 and Table 4)). Yet, there is a possibility that redundancy, due to genes with over-lapping functions in mismatch repair, suppress the mutation rate in dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strains. The possible redundancy only allows us to conclude that there is no evidence for a role of DPB3 and DPB4 (or Pol \\u03b5) in mismatch repair.\\n\\nWhether mismatch repair is carried out in the near proximity of the replication fork or is uncoupled from the replication fork remains unclear. It has been proposed that mismatch repair may be physically linked to the replication fork [58], but DNA lesions from MNNG may induce a futile repair cycle where mismatch repair functions outside the S-phase [59]. Based on the genetic analysis of DPB3 and DPB4 we propose a model with two zones where mutagenesis occurs during DNA replication. The first zone is in the near proximity of the replication fork where Pol \\u03b6- independent mutagenesis occurs and errors are corrected by mismatch repair. The second zone where Pol \\u0394 and Pol \\u03b6 carries out post-replication repair is uncoupled from the replication fork. In this zone, Pol \\u03b6-dependent mutagenesis occurs and errors are not at all or very inefficiently corrected by the mismatch repair system.\\n\\nThere is a series of observations upon which this model is based. We have clearly shown that the mutagenesis of the CAN1 gene in dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strains depends on Pol \\u03b6 and some mutation intermediates in the his7-2 allele are proofread by Pol \\u0394. Gap-filling during a post-replication repair process is likely to depend on PCNA, thus giving an advantage to Pol \\u03b4 and Pol \\u03b6 over Pol \\u03b5 to synthesize DNA since Pol \\u03b5 has a slow on-rate on the PCNA-primer ternary structure [14], [48]. Recently, during defective-replisome-induced mutagenesis it was independently shown that Pol \\u03b6 replicates undamaged DNA under conditions when the dynamics of the replication fork is affected [42]. Mismatch repair is functional in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 background and yet there is no synergism. A hypothetical role for Rev3 in the close proximity of the replication fork would result in replication errors that are expected to be corrected by the mismatch repair system, analogous to errors produced by proofreading deficient Pol \\u03b5. At this position Rev3 would be a major contributor to the mutation rate in a msh2\\u0394 strain, because Rev3 is responsible for at least half the mutation rate in the CAN1 gene in wild-type strains. The combination of rev3\\u0394 and msh2\\u0394 would then result in a substantially lower mutation rate; however, this was not the case. Instead, the mutation rate in a rev3\\u0394msh2\\u0394 strain was comparable to a msh2\\u0394 strain [47], suggesting that errors by Pol \\u03b6 are not efficiently corrected by mismatch repair. Our results demonstrate that errors generated by Pol \\u03b6 are not efficiently repaired by mismatch repair and are supported by evidence that some mutations generated by Pol \\u03b6 in a rad52\\u0394 background are not corrected by mismatch repair in the lys2\\u0394 A746-NR allele [60]. Based on the sum of these observations we propose that the deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 results in a decreased Pol \\u03b5 processivity, generating a DNA substrate, which must be processed to some extent by Pol \\u03b4 and Pol \\u03b6 during post-replication repair. This event occurs in a zone separated from active replication forks where the correction of errors by mismatch repair may be inefficient.\\n\\nAlternative interpretations could be that synthesis by Pol \\u03b6 at stalled replication forks is not under mismatch repair surveillance. The transient dissociation of Pol \\u03b5 would, in this case, create specific conditions when mismatch repair cannot function. Under these specific conditions any repair synthesis at the replication fork as well as post replicative repair synthesis in the single stranded gaps might escape MMR. The influence of chromatin on mutation rates and mismatch repair could also be an explanation. A potential mechanism could be that PCNA is post-translationally modified, due to check-point activation, blocking the interaction between mismatch repair proteins and PCNA. Regions with post-translationally modified PCNA would then be less efficiently repaired by mismatch repair.\\n\\nMismatch repair genes are not exclusively involved in correcting replication errors at the replication fork. Recently, it was shown that mismatch repair genes suppress recombination and promote translesion synthesis by Pol \\u03b6 in an assay measuring spontaneous mutation rates [60]. Other examples are immunoglobulin genes where mismatch repair together with Pol \\u03b7 is required for hypermutation at A/T pairs [61]. This is a paradox as the mismatch repair system promotes error-prone DNA synthesis by Pol \\u03b6 and Pol \\u03b7 in these two examples. The deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 unveils another example of how error-prone DNA synthesis is accepted to complete DNA synthesis and the mismatch-repair system does not correct the errors. The contribution of these Pol \\u03b6 dependent errors is small when compared to the error load which is corrected by mismatch repair at the proximity of the replication fork (compare CAN1 mutation rate in dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 with msh2\\u0394 (Table 4)). Yet, we found that the error-rate in the dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strain was comparable to the pol2-4 strain. The error-rate in pol2-4/pol2-4 mice was recently reported to be sufficient to support tumor development in mice [62]. Although the mechanism by which the error rates increases in pol2-4 and dpb3\\u0394 dpb4\\u0394 strains clearly differs, it is tempting to speculate that the inactivation of the mammalian homologues to DPB3 and DPB4 could result in defective replisomes, elevated mutation rates and tumor development.\\n\\nAll S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are isogenic to E134 (MAT\\u03b1 ade5-1 lys2::InsEA14 trp1-289 his7-2 leu2-3,112 ura3-52) [33]. The dpb3\\u0394 mutant was kindly provided by P. Shcherbakova and is described in [27]. Other strains carrying dpb3\\u0394 were obtained as described in [27]. The dpb4\\u0394 mutants were constructed by transformation with PCR fragment carrying the hygB selectable marker and obtained using primers DPB4/kanMX-F (5\\u2032-ATGCCACCAAAAGGTTGGAGAAAAGACGCCCAAGGGAATTACCCCCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC) and DPB4/kanMX-R (5\\u2032-TTACGTTTGCTCAAGGTTTTGAACTCTAGTTTCTACATCTTGGCTATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG) and the pAG32 plasmid as a template [63]. The disruption was confirmed by PCR analysis. The pol2-4 mutation was obtained as described in [64] using YIpJB1 plasmid carrying pol2-4 mutation [65]. The pol3-5DV mutation was obtained as described in [64] using plasmid p170-5DV [66].The presence of the pol2-4 mutation after integration into the chromosome was confirmed by SfcI digest of short PCR fragment encompassing mutation and DNA sequencing. Deletion of the MSH6 gene was obtained as described in [67]. The REV3 gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of Pol \\u03b6, was deleted as described in [68]. Deletion of the MSH2 gene was obtained by transformation with PCR product obtained from the pRS305 plasmid using oligos MSH2_del_F (CTCCACTAGGCCAGAGCTAAAATTCTCTGATGTATCAGAGGAGAGCAGAGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACC) and MSH2_del_R (CCTTCACTTTTCTAATCCACTCTTTCAGTAAAGCCTTCAAACGAACGCATCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCGC). The same strategy was used for deletion of the PMS1 and MLH1 gene. To obtain pms1\\u0394 we used oligos PMS1_A (TATCAAAGCTAGATCATATTTCGTAATCCTTCGAAAATGAGCTCCAATCACGTAAAATATCTTGACCGCAGTTAA) and PMS1_S (AAGGTGTAAGCAAAAGGAACAGAGGTATATCCCTGTGAAATATTTATTTAGCCCCTATGAACATATTCCATT). The mlh1\\u0394 was obtained by transformation with the PCR product obtained from the pRS306 plasmid using oligos MLH1_A (AAGTTAACACCTCTCAAAAACTTTGTATAGATCTGGAAGGTTGGCTATTTCCAACACCGCAGGGTAATAACTGAT) and MLH1_S (ATACGATAGTGATAGTAAATGGAAGGTAAAAATAACATAGACCTATCAATAAGCACGGTCACAGCTTGTCTGTAA).\\n\\nThe fluctuation tests to determine spontaneous mutation rates were, unless otherwise indicated, performed in two to five independent experiments of nine independent cultures each with independently obtained derivatives. Single two-day-old colonies from YPD plates were inoculated in 5 ml of liquid YPD medium and were grown with strong aeration for two days and processed as described [33].\\n\\nIndependent His+ revertants and Canr mutants were grown as small patches on YPD plates. Regions of corresponding genes were amplified by PCR. Amplified DNAs were purified by QIAGEN PCR purification kit and sequenced by MWG Biotech (www.mwgdna.com). CAN1 spectra obtained in four strains were compared using several statistical techniques. A Monte Carlo modification of the Pearson \\u03c72 test of spectra homogeneity [69] was used to compare 2 x N tables (two mutation spectra, N\\u22652). Small probability values (P\\u22640.05) indicate a significant difference between two spectra. Calculations were done using the program COLLAPSE [70].\\n\\nAll purification steps were carried out as described in [32].\\n\\nWe used primer 3NY (5\\u2032-AGGTCACGATGCGGCATAGCCTGCATTGATCGCACGATGATCAGCGGACTGCTTACC) annealed to the template 19wt (3\\u2032-TCCAGTGCTACGCCGTATCGGACGTAACTAGCGTGCTACTAGTCGCCTGACGAATGGACAGTGCCATTGTCACTG) as a substrate for the exonuclease reaction. The primer (8 \\u00b5M) was labeled with 40 \\u00b5Ci of [\\u03b3-32P]ATP in a 20-\\u00b5l reaction with 10 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) for 1 h. The reaction was stopped with EDTA and labeled products were purified through PAGE. The end-labeled primer was annealed to the template at 1.5: 1 ratio for a 5 minute incubation at 80\\u00b0C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. For the exonuclease assay 0.5 nM substrate was incubated with 0.1 nM Pol \\u03b5 or 0.5 nM Pol2/Dpb2 complex in a 65 \\u00b5l reaction mixture (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8; 1 mM DTT; 0.2 mg/ml Ac-BSA; 8 mM MgCl2; 125 mM NaAc). Fifteen \\u00b5l aliquots were taken at the indicated time points and were mixed with 8 \\u00b5l stop solution (80% formamide; 50 mM EDTA; 1 mM bromophenol blue). Before loading the reactions on a 12% polyacrylamide-urea gel, the primer-templates were denatured at 99\\u00b0 C for 4 min and then cooled on ice. The intensity of bands corresponding to different exonuclease products was quantified using phosphoimager plates and the ImageQuant software package supplied with a Typhoon 9400 phosphoimager (Amersham Biosciences).\\n\\nFor primer extension assay a [\\u03b3-32P]ATP \\u2013labeled (as described previously) 50-mer oligonucleotide was annealed to the pBluescript II SK(+) ssDNA in a ratio of 1\\u22361.5. For the DNA synthesis processivity assay, the substrate (14 nM) was incubated with the four-subunit Pol \\u03b5 (0.35 nM) or Pol2/Dpb2 complex (0.7 nM) in a reaction mixture (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8; 1 mM DTT; 0.2 mg/ml Ac-BSA; 8 mM MgCl2; 125 mM NaAc; 100 \\u00b5M dNTP). Because the loading efficiency of the Pol2/Dpb2 complex on DNA was compromised we used a two and five-fold higher concentration of the Pol2/Dpb2 complex, compared to the full-subunit Pol \\u03b5, in the primer-extension assay and exonuclease assay, respectively. The conditions were empirically determined to meet single-hit kinetics, i.e. where a polymerase molecule never re-associated with a previously extended primer.\\n\\nIn the primer-extension assay, the termination probability at position N at each primer/template was calculated by dividing the intensity of the band N by the intensity of all bands \\u2265 N. In the exonuclease processivity assay, the termination probability at position N at each primer/template was calculated by dividing the intensity of the band N by the intensity of all bands \\u2264 N [71].\\n\\nDNA synthesis fidelity was measured using the bacteriophage M13mp2 forward mutation assay described previously [39], [40]. Briefly, double-stranded M13mp2 DNA with a 407-nucleotide single-stranded region containing a portion of the lacZ gene was used as a substrate for in vitro DNA synthesis. Reactions mixtures contained \\u223c1.5 nM DNA template, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 100 \\u00b5g/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, 250 \\u00b5M dNTPs and 14 nM wild type or exonuclease-deficient 2-subunit Pol \\u03b5. Reactions were incubated at 30\\u00b0C for 30 min. Aliquots of the reactions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm complete gap-filling, and another aliquot of DNA was introduced into E.coli to score the frequency of light blue and colorless plaques reflecting errors made during in vitro DNA synthesis. Single stranded DNA was isolated from independent mutant M13 plaques and the lacZ gene was sequenced. Error rates (ER) for individual types of mutation were calculated according to the following equation: ER \\u200a=\\u200a [(Ni/N)\\u00d7MF]/(D\\u00d70.6) where Ni is the number of mutations of a particular type, N is the total number of mutants analyzed, MF is frequency of lacZ mutants, D is the number of detectable sites for the particular type of mutation, and 0.6 is the probability of expressing a mutant lacZ allele in E. coli.\\n\",\n          \"Leprosy, also called Hansen's disease, is a persistent infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. While leprosy can be transmitted by armadillos in the Southern United States [1] humans are the most important reservoir for M. leprae and the more common route is human-human transmission. Leprosy can lead to the destruction of peripheral nerves and subsequent extreme deformities of the skin and peripheral limbs. Despite effective chemotherapy and active case finding, the global number of new leprosy cases is estimated at over 200,000 annually [2]. Furthermore, microbiologically cured patients require follow-up to prevent nerve damage from sequellae of the disease. Due to the extreme social stigma and the long term follow-up, leprosy presents a large emotional and financial burden for affected communities and health care systems.\\n      \\nThere is strong evidence for an important role of host genetics on leprosy susceptibility. For example, disease concordance is significantly higher among monozygotic as compared to dizygotic twins [3], and a number of complex segregation analyses have provided evidence for the presence of major genes in leprosy susceptibility [4]. A recent genome-wide association study detected and replicated susceptibility factors in CCDC12, C13orf31, NOD2, TNFSF15, RIP2K, and the HLA-DR/DQ locus and revealed a striking overlap with Crohn's disease susceptibility factors [5], [6]. Likewise, a number of candidate gene association studies have implicated additional genes in leprosy susceptibility [7]. Employing a genome-wide linkage based strategy, two major susceptibility loci were identified on chromosome 6 in Vietnamese families [8]. The locus on the short arm of the chromosome led to the identification of MHC class I and class III leprosy susceptibility factors [9], [10] while genetic variants in the regulatory region of PARK2/PACRG on chromosome 6q25 were uncovered as a common risk factor for leprosy [8]. The role of PARK2 as susceptibility gene in infectious diseases was further supported by the subsequent identification of PARK2 promoter variants as risk factors for typhoid fever [11].\\n      \\nThe identification of PARK2 as leprosy susceptibility gene was unexpected and the role of the PARK2 encoded protein, Parkin, in leprosy pathogenesis has remained unknown. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase which is malfunctioning in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) [12]\\u2013[14]. Parkin has been given multiple roles related to neuronal survival in the context of Parkinsonism [15]\\u2013[22]. However, none of these functions explains the identification of PARK2 as a genetic susceptibility factor for leprosy or typhoid fever, diseases characterized by the infection of macrophages with intracellular bacteria. Parkin/PACRG have been shown to be important for the autophagic elimination of aggregated proteins [21], [23], [24]. Interestingly, a role in autophagy is also found with immune regulators such as NOD2 and other genes associated with both Crohn's disease and mycobacterial infections (reviewed in [25]). As first step towards the elucidation of Parkin in leprosy pathogenesis, we studied the impact of Parkin on measures of innate immunity in human macrophages and Schwann cells which are the main host cells of M. leprae in humans. We report here that abrogation of PARK2 in macrophages and Schwann cells affects their ability to produce IL-6 and MCP-1, two key pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, we demonstrate significant correlation of IL6 and CCL2 transcript levels in a whole blood assay with specific variants of PARK2 previously identified as leprosy risk factors.\\n    \\nFor the gene expression experiments, 62 unrelated Vietnamese Kinh individuals were recruited at the Dermato-Venereology (DV) Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. Of those, 56 were leprosy patients while six had no history of leprosy disease. Since leprosy shows a strong gender bias, 43 subjects were males and 19 were females. Healthy Caucasian volunteers were enrolled for derivation of monocyte-derived macrophages. The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of Helsinki. Signed informed consent was obtained from every person participating in the study. The study and subject enrolment were approved by the Ethical and Scientific Committee of the Dermato-Venerology Hospital and the Health Services Peoples' Committee, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, and the Research Ethics Board at the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.\\n      \\nRPMI-1640, GlutaMAX, penicillin, streptomycin, fetal bovine serum (FBS), TRIzol, and AlexaFluor 488 anti-mouse were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 4\\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD), anti-Parkin monoclonal antibody (clone PRK8) and monoclonal anti-beta actin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St-Louis, MO). Antibodies against I\\u03baB\\u03b6, phospho-I\\u03baB\\u03b1 (S32), phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-JNK, phospho-p38 and total JNK were purchased from New England Biolabs (Pickering, ON). PI3K\\u03b3 inhibitor AS605240 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL). Recombinant human MCP-1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).\\n      \\nTHP-1 promonocytic cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassass, VA) and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, GlutaMAX and penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic cocktail (Invitrogen). Primary human Schwann cells were purchased from Sciencell (San Diego, CA) and cultured in SCM supplemented with 5% serum and growth supplements (Sciencell). For stimulation and cytokine determination, Schwann cell medium was replaced with RPMI+10% FBS. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by incubating with 200 nM PMA for 24 h, then leaving the adherent cells to recover and differentiate for another 24 hr in medium without PMA. For some experiments, 10 nM VD was added to culture medium during and after PMA treatment. For human monocyte-derived macrophages, venous blood was collected from healthy volunteers. The PBMC fraction was isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions, diluted in RPMI medium and incubated for 1 hour onto gelatin-coated culture dishes. Adherent monocytes were trypsinized and transferred to a culture flask containing RPMI-10% FBS supplemented with 15% of L929 conditioned medium as a source of M-CSF. After 5 days, adherent, differentiated macrophages were collected and used for experiments. The purity was consistently >95% as determined by the expression of the macrophage mannose receptor. All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\\u00b0C and 5% CO2. When M. leprae bacteria were added, cells were cultured under the same conditions except that antibiotics were omitted and the temperature was set to 33\\u00b0C.\\n      \\nViable Mycobacterium leprae were obtained from the National Hansen's Disease Programs Laboratory at Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, LA). The Thai-53 isolate of M. leprae was maintained in the footpads of athymic nu/nu mice and harvested as described previously [26]. Extraneous mouse tissue was removed by incubating the bacterial suspension in 0.1N NaOH for 3 min followed by extensive washing in RPMI 1640 (Gibco)+10% FCS (HyClone). Bacterial viability was determined by radiorespirometry, which measures the oxidation of 14C-palmitic acid to 14CO2 [27] and vital staining which measures cell wall integrity [28]. All M. leprae preparations underwent quality control testing for microbial contamination. Freshly harvested bacilli were stored at 4\\u00b0C. Mice used in the propagation of M. leprae were housed in accordance with standards established in the PHS Guide to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition) under a protocol approved by the IACUC of the National Hansen's Disease Program, Baton Rouge, La.

Inactivated (irradiated) armadillo-derived M. leprae whole cells were probe sonicated with a Sanyo sonicator to >95% breakage to produce whole cell sonicate. Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Pasteur) and M. tuberculosis H37Ra were gifts of Dr. Marcel Behr (McGill University). They were cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 medium containing ADC supplement and used fresh to make single-cell suspensions.\\n      \\nSTEALTH siRNA duplexes directed against Parkin and scrambled control duplexes were obtained from Invitrogen. siRNA sequences (sense, RNA) were as follows: Scrambled 5\\u2032-GGACUACAUGAUUCGACGUCAACUG-3\\u2032; Parkin_A 5\\u2032-GGAAACAUCAGUAGCUUUGCACCUG-3\\u2032; Parkin_B 5\\u2032-UUGCUUAGACUGUUUCCACUUAUAC-3\\u2032. Parkin A and B correspond respectively to positions 758\\u2013782 and 875\\u2013899 of human PARK2 mRNA (NCBI accession BC022014.2). Cells were transfected with a Microporator device (NanoEnTek, Seoul, South Korea) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, adherent cells were detached by trypsin digestion, rinsed, resuspended with a final concentration of 10 nM siRNA and electroporated with a single 20 ms pulse set at 1700 volts. Mortality due to electroporation was minimal, typically less than 10%. Cells were then returned to normal culture conditions for 48 hours, after which they were stimulated and assayed.\\n      \\nWe collected 20 ml of whole blood from each individual by venipuncture. Blood samples were split in two aliquots and each aliquot was mixed 1\\u22362 with RPMI medium containing L-glutamine (300 mg/L) and HEPES (10 mM). One aliquot was stimulated with M. leprae sonicate at a concentration of 20 \\u00b5g/ml, which approximately corresponds to an MOI of 50 M. leprae per white blood cell. The second aliquot was left untreated. Each aliquot, the stimulated one and the control, was divided into four 50 ml polystyrene tubes to facilitate better leukocytes adhesion and aeration of blood. Tubes were incubated for 30 hrs at 37\\u00b0C, 5% CO2.\\n      \\nTotal RNA from blood samples was extracted employing a modified protocol of the LeukoLOCK RNA extraction kit (Ambion, CA, USA). Briefly, blood aliquots were filtered by gravity through LeukoLOCK filters to isolate leukocytes. Collected cells were rinsed to eliminate red blood cells and lysed directly on the LeukoLOCK filters. Extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNAs were kept under ethanol and ammonium acetate at \\u221280\\u00b0C. Prior to further experiments, all samples were cleaned with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Germany).\\n      \\nThe qualitative and quantitative analysis of RNA samples was done using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent,USA). The QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Germany) was utilized for reverse transcription of RNA samples. In brief, 500 ng of total RNA were treated with gDNA wipeout reagent to remove genomic DNA contamination and further transcribed following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-Time PCR was performed using the Rotor-Gene RG-3000 system (Corbett Research/Qiagen, Germany). The final volume of the PCR mix was 20 \\u00b5l, with 16 ng of cDNA, 10 \\u00b5l of Maxima Probe/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas, Lithuania), and 1 \\u00b5l of IL-6 or MCP-1 TaqMan Gene Expression Assay probe mix (Applied Biosystems, USA). The HPRT gene probe was used as reference house-keeping gene. A comparative \\u0394\\u0394Ct method [29] was used to determine the regulation of the gene expression in response to M. leprae sonicate.\\n      \\nGenomic DNA was obtained from all subjects enrolled in the study. We then obtained the genotypes for 31 SNPs that span approximately 320 kb of genomic DNA in the promoter region, exon 1 and intron 1 of PARK2. Based on the tag SNP information available from the International HapMap project database (www.hapmap.org/) for the Chinese population, which we know to strongly resemble the Vietnamese situation, these SNPs represent over 80% of the common genetic information of the target region. These SNPs were genotyped on the high-throughput SEQUENOM MassARRAY platform, which uses the iPLEX assay to incorporate mass-modified terminal nucleotides in the SBE step, which are then detected by MALDI-TOF MS [30] or the ultra-high throughput Illumina platform. This platform uses the GoldenGate assay followed by a bead-based technology to resolve individual SNP genotypes [31].\\n      \\nMacrophages were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 5\\u00d7105 cells per well and Schwann cells at a density of 5\\u00d7104 cells per well. Cells were treated with stimuli for 6\\u201324 hours; the supernatants were collected, cleared by centrifugation and assayed using Milliplex MAP 42-plex human cytokine kit on a Milliplex Analyzer 3.1 Luminex 200 machine (Millipore, Chicago, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, supernatants were analyzed using custom Q-Plex chemiluminescent multiplex ELISA arrays measuring human IL-1\\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF (Quansys Biosciences, Logan, UT). Array images were acquired and analyzed using the Quansys Q-View imager and software.\\n      \\nTHP-1 macrophages were cultured in serum-free medium overnight then treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for various times and lysed in denaturing buffer (8 M urea, 1% SDS, 40 mM Tris, pH 8.0). Twenty micrograms of protein were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 1% casein in TBS and stained with antibodies overnight at 4\\u00b0C then with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse for one hour. The signal was revealed with Immobilion Western substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Equal loading was verified with an antibody against \\u03b2-actin following reprobing of the membrane.\\n      \\nTransAM transcription factor assay kits for NF-\\u03baB and AP-1 families were obtained from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). The assays were used to measure the amount of nuclear protein that could bind to \\u03baB and AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides immobilized on a solid substrate. The bound nuclear proteins were probed with anti-p65 for NF-\\u03baB and anti-phospho-c-Jun for AP-1. In brief, macrophages were seeded into 6-well plates at 2\\u00d7106 cells per well and treated for 2 hours. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the instructions given in the manual and 5 \\u00b5g of nuclear proteins were used for the binding assays. Positive control extracts for NF-\\u03baB and AP-1 assays (5 \\u00b5g of Raji or TPA-treated K562 extracts, respectively) were used to normalize the values.\\n      \\nThe expression levels of IL6 and CCL2 in M. leprae sonicate stimulated and non-stimulated whole blood assays for all 62 subjects were used as quantitative traits in an eQTL analysis. Association between expression levels of CCL2 and IL6 and SNP alleles in PARK2/PACRG was tested by means of the Likelihood Ratio Test as implemented in the GENMOD procedure of the SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and assuming a dominant genetic model since this is the model providing best evidence of association with leprosy [32]. Due to the known strong impact of gender on leprosy risk, we adjusted the analysis for sex of subjects.\\n      \\nParkin is expressed in many cells of the immune system, including macrophages and T-cells. We used siRNA-mediated PARK2 gene knockdown to study the function of Parkin in macrophages. siRNA duplexes were delivered by high-efficiency electroporation into differentiated cells of the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Real-time quantitative PCR and indirect immunofluorescence analysis of Parkin showed that THP-1 cells transfected with Parkin-specific siRNAs expressed substantially less Parkin than THP-1 control cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA control (Figure 1A), with knockdown efficiencies ranging from \\u223c80% to 90% as determined by qPCR (data not shown).\\n        \\nTo determine a possible role of Parkin in the production of soluble immune mediators by macrophages, THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages, transfected with siRNA (either Parkin A or scrambled control) and stimulated with live M. tuberculosis H37Ra or viable M. leprae (ML) for six hours (Figure 1B). A multiplex quantitation of 42 soluble immune mediators using the Milliplex system was performed on the culture supernatants to identify cytokines modulated by Parkin knockdown. While M. tuberculosis H37Ra induced a robust cytokine response, ML had a much lower impact. Out of the 42 soluble factors, a total of 12 cytokines/chemokines could be detected either at ex vivo production levels or induced by at least one stimulus (Figure 1B). When expressed as the ratio of cytokine concentrations secreted by Parkin knocked-down cells over controls, we observed that IL-6, induced by H37Ra, and MCP-1 either at constitutive production levels or induced are both diminished approximately four-fold by Parkin knockdown. By contrast, all other cytokines are modulated less than two-fold. We could not detect baseline IL-6 or induced by ML under these conditions.\\n        \\nIn a second round of experiments, we sought confirmationof these initial observations by screening with a more limited number of cytokines and a different assay system, the Q-Plex multiplex ELISA. We also considered it important to test a 24 hour time point. One limitation was that H37Ra induced visible toxicity in macrophages at six hours which resulted in significant cell death at 24 hours (data not shown) precluding its use as a reliable stimulant for kinetics studies. We instead opted for Mycobacterium bovis \\u2013 Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) which was nontoxic under the same experimental conditions. Since it was possible that BCG would not induce the same magnitude and range of response as H37Ra, we also included LPS, a well-known macrophage stimulant, as a positive control. Six cytokines/chemokines were measured: IL-1\\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, MCP-1 (CCL2) and TNF (Figure 1C, D). Similar to the first round, a pattern emerged with IL-6 and MCP-1 being specifically repressed by Parkin silencing. At 6 hours, IL-6 was only affected employing LPS as stimulant since BCG and M. leprae induced little IL-6 secretion (Figure 1C). At 24 hours, both LPS and BCG induced secretion of IL-6which was repressed by Parkin knockdown for both stimulants (Figure 1D). All IL-8 values at 24 hours, even in the un-induced state, were above the highest standard and are thus not represented in the figure. The overall Parkin effect was less pronounced at 24 hours, possibly reflecting a time-dependent plateau effect for cytokine production (Figure 1C, D).\\n      \\nIn order to verify and extend the previous observations, a third round of experiments was carried out focusing on IL-6 and MCP-1 and adding a second distinct siRNA for Parkin knockdown, as well as cells of different types. Replication of the results with a second siRNA duplex was done to rule out off-target effects. While we had obtained experimental evidence for an effect of Parkin on IL-6 production in response to H37Ra and LPS, we could not detect a similar effect for BCG and M. leprae at 6 hours, presumably due to the low and delayed responsiveness of THP-1 macrophages to these mycobacteria. It had been proposed that priming of macrophages with the active form of vitamin D (1\\u201325-hydroxyvitamin D3, VD) may increase the responsiveness of macrophages to microbial ligands [33] possibly due to the fact that VD can induce the expression of NOD2, an important sensor of intracellular bacteria [34]. We therefore primed THP-1 macrophages with 10 nM VD for the duration of the experiment and stimulated the cells with LPS, BCG or M. leprae and measured IL-6 and MCP-1 levels by ELISA (Figure 2A\\u2013B, top right panel). VD treatment strongly promoted IL-6 production by THP-1 macrophages in response to the mycobacteria (Figure 2A) and allowed the determination of the effect of Parkin knockdown on ML-induced IL-6. Parkin silencing with Parkin-A siRNA reduced ML-triggered IL-6 production to 48% of control (p<0.05) and to 35% (p<0.01) with Parkin B. However, VD treatment had no effect on the induction of MCP-1, which was still near baseline (Figure 2B, top right).\\n        \\nVD treatment did not prime human monocyte-derived macrophages to produce IL-6 in response to BCG or ML. These cells were not very sensitive to LPS either with only a fivefold increase in IL-6 (mostly repressed by Parkin knockdown) and no increase in MCP-1 production (Figure 2A\\u2013B, bottom left panel). Nonetheless, VD-treated MDMs spontaneously secreted substantial amounts of both cytokines which was significantly inhibited by Parkin knockdown (p<0.01).\\n        \\nSchwann cells are the primary host cells of M. leprae in human leprosy patients and express Parkin at levels similar to macrophages [8]. We transfected primary human Schwann cell cultures with siRNA and stimulated them for 6 hours as with macrophages. Both IL-6 and MCP-1 could be detected in the supernatants of Schwann cell cultures and were not affected by the presence of VD (data not shown). LPS induced a 5-fold induction of IL-6 and an approximate two-fold increase in the production of MCP-1 over baseline production levels. Neither BCG nor M. leprae stimulation resulted in a significant induction of either cytokines over resting levels. Parkin knockdown led to a general decrease of IL-6 and MCP-1 production, both at resting levels (inclusive the presence of BCG and ML) or induced by LPS (Figure 2A\\u2013B, bottom right panel).\\n      \\nTo resolve the apparent selectivity of Parkin in cytokine modulation, we measured I\\u03baB-\\u03b1 phosphorylation, a measure of canonical NF-\\u03baB activation, as well as the levels of the NF-\\u03baB-inducible I\\u03baB-\\u03b6, a nuclear factor that associates with and activates a subset of NF-\\u03baB-dependent promoters upstream of genes such as Il-6, Il-12b, Csf2 and HBD2 [35], [36]. Western blotting of THP-1 lysates following Parkin knockdown and LPS stimulation did not reveal differences in phosphorylation of I\\u03baB-\\u03b1 or induction of I\\u03baB-\\u03b6 protein, strongly arguing against a role of these factors in the selectivity of Parkin immunomodulation (Figure 3A). Moreover, a transcription factor ELISA measuring NF-\\u03baB DNA-binding complexes in LPS-stimulated THP-1 nuclear extracts did not reveal a consistent effect of Parkin on transcriptional activity (Figure 3B).\\n        \\nTriggering of the MAPK cascade by TLR leads to the assembly of the AP-1 complex on cytokine/chemokine promoters and is essential for expression of most pro-inflammatory mediators. We measured the phosphorylation of the three major MAPK: ERK1/2, JNK and p38, in cells with normal or depleted Parkin levels and treated with LPS for 0\\u201360 minutes (Figure 3C). ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation were not affected by Parkin. JNK phosphorylation was higher in knocked-down cells, which agrees with previous reports of Parkin suppressing JNK activity [37], [38]. To test a possible contribution of JNK to the abrogation of LPS-induced IL-6 production, we pretreated cells with a well-known JNK inhibitor, SP600125. Inactivation of JNK strongly suppressed IL-6 induction by LPS but failed to abolish the effect of Parkin silencing (Figure 3D). In addition, stronger JNK activation in the absence of Parkin did not translate into stronger AP-1 DNA binding, which was unaffected by PARK2 knockdown (Figure 3B).\\n      \\nWhile the above experiments provided strong evidence for a role of Parkin in MCP-1 and IL-6 production, they did not address the effect of different PARK2 alleles on the production of these cytokines. Polymorphisms in the PARK2 promoter region are strong risk factors for leprosy in the Vietnamese and the Brazilian populations [8]. To investigate a possible effect of genetic polymorphisms in the PARK2 promoter region on CCL2 and IL6 transcript levels, we stimulated whole blood from 62 Vietnamese subjects with M. leprae sonicate and extracted total RNA for gene expression analysis. Whole M. leprae had low stimulation potential in the cellular assays. Hence, we opted for M. leprae sonicate as stimulant since it was reported to elicit a more robust immune response, presumably by exposing otherwise inaccessible antigens [39], [40]. We determined the gene expression levels before and after stimulation with M. leprae sonicate for both CCL2 and IL6 (Figure 4). In non-stimulated blood cultures both CCL2 and IL6 could be readily detected with IL6 showing a slightly higher mean of transcript levels. Stimulation with M. leprae sonicate resulted in a strong upregulation of both genes. The extent of up-regulation and fold-induction of both genes were very similar (Figure 4).\\n        \\nEx vivo CCL2 and IL6 transcript levels as well as the M. leprae sonicate triggered increase in CCL2 and IL6 transcripts were then correlated with a panel of SNPs that span the promoter region, exon 1 and part of intron 1 of the PARK2 5\\u2032 region. The selected SNPs capture more than 80% of the common genetic variation (allele frequency>5%) in the target region. Based on the existing linkage disequilibrium in the samples used for the analysis three groups of moderately correlated SNPs (r2>0.5 SNP bins) can be distinguished (Table 1). We detected significant evidence for association between SNPs of one bin and baseline levels of CCL2 (\\u0394Ct) as well as the increase of CCL2 and IL6 transcripts (\\u0394\\u0394Ct) following stimulation with sonicate (Table 1). Significant evidence for association was observed under a dominant effect of the major allele. The most consistent and strongest evidence for association was observed for a group of 3 SNPs (rs6915128, rs10806768, rs1333955) located approximately 60 kbp upstream of PARK2 (Table 1). Interestingly, these were the same SNPs that had shown replicated evidence for association of their major allele with leprosy in both Vietnamese and Indian leprosy patients [32].\\n        \\nWe then asked if the major SNP allele was correlated with increased or decreased CCL2 and IL6 transcript levels. As can be seen from the regression coefficients in Table 1, in resting non-stimulated whole blood cultures the absence of the major alleles leads to a significant decrease in CCL2 transcripts. The same trend is seen for IL6 but fails to reach significance. Conversely, in M. leprae sonicate triggered cultures increase in both CCL2 and IL6 transcripts is significantly correlated with absence of the major allele. The most parsimonious explanation for this effect is that sonicate stimulation led to a plateau of both transcripts which was largely independent of the SNP genotypes. This resulted in a smaller increase in those cultures that already had a higher baseline transcript level. However, the most interesting aspect of these experiments was that the same alleles in the same SNPs impacted both CCL2 and IL6 transcript levels and susceptibility to leprosy.\\n      \\nOur results showed that Parkin participates in the modulation of IL-6 and MCP-1 production, two key mediators of innate immunity. PARK2 knockdown in THP-1 macrophages, and Schwann cells consistently repressed LPS-induced IL-6 and basal MCP-1 levels. This repression displayed a degree of specificity as modulation of other cytokines or chemokines tested in our study was less pronounced. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out a significant effect of Parkin on other immune mediators that were either not included in our screen or not secreted by our cellular model. The preferential impact on certain immune mediators argued against a non-specific effect of Parkin on the general state of cellular physiology. Conversely, these results supported a Parkin-dependent modulation of specific pathways of immune responsiveness to microbial antigens. We hypothesized that the link between Parkin immune modulation and pathogen stimulation might be provided by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Modulation of IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion via the TLR signaling cascade is a reasonable hypothesis since TLR recognition of M. leprae antigens is a well-established step in leprosy pathogenesis. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in TLR1 [41]\\u2013[43], TLR2 [44], and TLR4 [45] are associated with leprosy and/or leprosy reactions.\\n      \\nWe evaluated the ability of Parkin-silenced cells to phosphorylate I\\u03baB-\\u03b1, a critical step in the TLR pathway leading to activation of NF-\\u03baB, and found no difference of the I\\u03baB-\\u03b1 phosphorylation state. Parkin levels did not affect the induction of nuclear I\\u03baB-\\u03b6, a positive regulator with some selectivity for the IL6 promoter [35] that is partially under the control of NF-\\u03baB itself [36]. We also investigated the MAPK pathway which leads to the activation of the AP-1 transcriptional factor complex and found higher phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) after LPS treatment in Parkin-silenced cells, while ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation were unaffected. This agrees with previous reports of Parkin inhibiting JNK through mono-ubiquitination of Hsp70 [37], [38]. The role of JNK in modulating cytokine production by human macrophages is controversial. Some studies reported an inhibition of LPS-induced IL-12 expression by JNK in THP-1 cells [46], [47], while other studies showed the opposite [48]. However, we did not attempt to investigate this question in more detail since the impact of Parkin on IL-6 production was not related to its inhibition of JNK activation. Finally, a transcription factor ELISA of NF-\\u03baB and AP-1 complexes did not reveal any consistent effect of Parkin on LPS-induced DNA binding. While we failed to identify the mechanism by which Parkin modulates IL-6 and MCP-1 production, the results of our experiments argue against a general role of Parkin in the canonical TLR signaling cascade and are consistent with the more specific effect that Parkin exerts on IL-6 and MCP-1 production.\\n      \\nIn our experiments, the strongest inducer of cytokines/chemokines was LPS and the impact of Parkin on host cell responsiveness was most easily detectable in response to this stimulus in all cell types tested. Consistent with previous reports M. leprae was a poor inducer of host responses [49], [50], [51]. Interestingly, the use of VD as a priming agent significantly boosted the ability of THP-1 cells to respond to mycobacteria with secretion of IL-6. Our results were similar to studies in human monocytes [49]. In these cells, BCG triggered production of IL-6 and MCP-1 while M. leprae triggered production of MCP-1 [49]. Why THP-1 cells would respond less to M. leprae is presently not known but it is possible that the dose of M. leprae used in our experiment (MOI\\u200a=\\u200a50) was too low to promote MCP-1 production. Nevertheless, baseline production levels of MCP-1 and stimulus triggered production of IL-6 by Schwann and THP-1 cells were all diminished by Parkin knockdown. Given that both Schwann cells and THP-1 are sensitive to TLR2 ligands [52], [53] it appears that the immunogenic potential of BCG and M. leprae is dampened in intact bacteria.\\n      \\nOur functional studies identified PARK2 as mediator of IL-6 and MCP-1 production by macrophages. While this observation is exciting it did not address the impact of genetic PARK2 polymorphisms on IL-6 and MCP-1 production. One efficient means to probe for a possible link between genetic variation and mechanistic phenotypes are so-called expression quantitative loci (eQTL) studies. We established a dense map of genetic markers of the 5\\u2032 region of the PARK2 gene. These genetic markers were then correlated with IL6 and CCL2 transcript levels in whole blood assays in the presence and absence of high concentrations of M. leprae sonicate. We opted for high sonicate concentrations since in the functional studies whole M. leprae had relatively low potential to induce secretion of cytokines. A common set of three SNPs upstream of the PARK2 promoter was significantly associated with induced IL6 and CCL2 and non-triggered ex-vivo transcript levels of CCL2. The same set of polymorphisms has recently been found to be key leprosy susceptibility factors in both Vietnamese and Indian leprosy patients [32]. The latter observation is important since pattern of linkage disequilibrium between Indians and Vietnamese differ substantially in the studied PARK2 region suggesting a direct link between these SNPs and leprosy. Genome-wide eQTL studies have previously clearly shown that genetic variation at points far from the QTL, including different chromosomes (trans eQTL), can be significantly correlated with QTL expression levels [54]. While eQTL studies can tell us nothing about the mechanisms that cause the observed correlations, they do hold valuable information about which genes are likely to belong to the same host response pathway.\\n      \\nWhat is the possible functional relevance of Parkin modulating IL-6 and MCP-1 expression? IL-6 is a pluripotent cytokine and a key mediator of inflammation. IL-6 inhibits TGF-\\u03b2 dependent Treg differentiation and induces differentiation of na\\u00efve T-cells to the IL-17-producing TH17 lymphocyte subset [55]. IL-17 is part of the anti-tuberculosis immune response via its role in organizing granulomas [56] and by inducing the TH17 generation of cathelicidin [57], a potent antimicrobial peptide [58]. Interestingly, a low TH17 response in tuberculosis patients correlates with decreased IL-6 receptor expression on CD4+ T cells [59]. Besides its role in the anti-mycobacterial immune response, IL-6 signaling is important for nerve regeneration and myelination following injury [60], cellular processes specifically disrupted by M. leprae [61], [62]. A conditional knockout of a major IL-6 family signal transducer (gp130) leads to Schwann cell degradation and peripheral nerve demyelination [63], which is consistent with reports of IL-6 promoting myelination in cultured Schwann cells [64], [65]. Just as IL-6, MCP-1 is a major immune regulator of granuloma formation in response to mycobacterial infections. In the mouse model of tuberculosis, Ccl2 knock-out mice are significantly more susceptible to M. tuberculosis than their wild type littermates. In human genetic studies, evidence is accumulating for a role of MCP-1 in tuberculosis susceptibility possibly via the regulation of IL-12 levels [66], [67]. Less is known about MCP-1 in leprosy susceptibility. However, monocytes isolated from leprosy patients showed a reduced ability to produce MCP-1 in response to BCG and M. leprae as compared to healthy donors [51]. This observation is fully consistent with our results of (i) Parkin being a critical modulator of MCP-1 levels and (ii) the observed correlation of CCL2 transcript levels with genetic markers in the PARK2 promoter region that are confirmed leprosy susceptibility factors. Taken together, the present results provide an example of how genetic risk factors of leprosy may impact on leprosy pathogenesis by modulating the production of IL-6 and MCP-1, two key host response mediators.\\n    \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

The C. elegans PHR protein, called RPM-1, acts as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit the DLK-1 and MLK-1 MAP kinase pathways. We have identified several kinases that are likely to form a new MAP kinase pathway that suppresses synapse formation defects, but not axon termination defects, in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants. This pathway includes: MIG-15 (MAP4K), NSY-1 (MAP3K), JKK-1 (MAP2K) and JNK-1 (MAPK). Transgenic overexpression of kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is sufficient to impair synapse formation in wild-type animals. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions cell autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons, and these kinases localize to presynaptic terminals providing further evidence of a role in synapse development. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling also suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit that is likely to arise from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. Interestingly, habituation results are consistent with the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functioning as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1. These findings indicate the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway can restrict both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning.\\n\",\n          \"Increased incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has been recognized as a critical challenge to communicable disease control and public health response. This study aimed to quantify the association between climate variation and notified cases of HFMD in selected cities of Shanxi Province, and to provide evidence for disease control and prevention. Meteorological variables and HFMD cases data in 4 major cities (Datong, Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng) of Shanxi province, China, were obtained from the China Meteorology Administration and China CDC respectively over the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. Correlations analyses and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were used to identify and quantify the relationship between the meteorological variables and HFMD. HFMD incidence varied seasonally with the majority of cases in the 4 cities occurring from May to July. Temperatures could play important roles in the incidence of HFMD in these regions. The SARIMA models indicate that a 1\\u00b0 C rise in average, maximum and minimum temperatures may lead to a similar relative increase in the number of cases in the 4 cities. The lag times for the effects of temperatures were identified in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng. The numbers of cases were positively associated with average and minimum temperatures at a lag of 1 week in Taiyuan, Changzhi and Yuncheng, and with maximum temperature at a lag of 2 weeks in Yuncheng. Positive association between the temperature and HFMD has been identified from the 4 cities in Shanxi Province, although the role of weather variables on the transmission of HFMD varied in the 4 cities. Relevant prevention measures and public health action are required to reduce future risks of climate change with consideration of local climatic conditions.\\n\",\n          \"Previous works showed that immunization with saliva from Lutzomyia intermedia, a vector of Leishmania braziliensis, does not protect against experimental infection. However, L. braziliensis is also transmitted by Lutzomyia whitmani, a sand fly species closely related to Lu. intermedia. Herein we describe the immune response following immunization with Lu. whitmani saliva and the outcome of this response after L. braziliensis infection.\\nBALB/c mice immunized with Lu. whitmani saliva developed robust humoral and cellular immune responses, the latter characterized by an intense cellular infiltrate and production of IFN-\\u03b3 and IL-10, by both CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Mice immunized as above and challenged with L. braziliensis plus Lu. whitmani saliva displayed significantly smaller lesions and parasite load at the challenge site. This protection was associated with a higher (p<0.05) IFN-\\u03b3 production in response to SLA stimulation. Long-term persisting immunity was also detected in mice immunized with Lu. whitmani saliva. Furthermore, individuals residing in an endemic area for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) presented antibody responses to Lu. whitmani saliva. However CL patients, with active lesions, displayed a lower humoral response to Lu. whitmani saliva compared to individuals with subclinical Leishmania infection.\\nPre-exposure to Lu. whitmani saliva induces protection against L. braziliensis in a murine model. We also show that Lu. whitmani salivary proteins are immunogenic in naturally exposed individuals. Our results reinforce the importance of investigating the immunomodulatory effect of saliva from different species of closely related sand flies.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"plain language summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26124,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"We explored the molecular mechanisms that govern synapse formation in vivo using the nematode C. elegans. Our results have identified a conserved MIG-15/JNK-1 MAPK pathway that restricts formation of glutamatergic, neuron-neuron synapses in the mechanosensory neurons, but does not restrict synapse formation in motor neurons. This could have important implications because synapses made by the mechanosensory neurons are reminiscent of synapses in the mammalian central nervous system, and relatively little is known about the signals that specifically influence central synapse formation in vivo. Interestingly, our results are consistent with the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway opposing RPM-1, a signaling hub and ubiquitin ligase that inhibits different JNK and p38 signaling pathways. This suggests RPM-1 might inhibit specific MAPK pathways, such as the DLK-1 pathway, rather than simply acting as a general inhibitor of JNK and p38 signaling in neurons. Our results are particularly interesting given emerging links between JNK MAPK signaling and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.\\n\",\n          \"The high fidelity of DNA replication is safeguarded by the accuracy of nucleotide selection by DNA polymerases, proofreading activity of the replicative polymerases, and the DNA mismatch repair system. Errors made by replicative polymerases are corrected by mismatch repair, and inactivation of the mismatch repair system results in a multiplicative increase in error rates when combined with a proofreading deficient allele of a replicative polymerase. In this study, we demonstrate that the deletion of two non-essential genes encoding for two subunits of Pol \\u03b5 give an increased mutation rate due to increased synthesis by the error-prone DNA polymerase \\u03b6. Surprisingly, there was no multiplicative increase in error rates when the mismatch repair system was inactivated. We propose that the deletion of DPB3 and DPB4 gives a defective replisome, which in turn gives increased synthesis, in part, by Pol \\u03b6 during an error-prone post-replication process that is not efficiently repaired by the mismatch repair system.\\n\",\n          \"Leprosy is an infectious disease with a strong host genetic component. The identification of host genetic lesions predisposing to disease is a powerful approach for mapping key junctions in the host pathogen interplay. Genetic variants located in the promoter region of the PARK2 gene are replicated leprosy susceptibility factors. To better understand a possible contribution of PARK2 to host effector mechanisms in leprosy patients, we developed a cellular model to test the contribution of the PARK2 encoded parkin protein to host responses to mycobacterial antigens. We observed that parkin was a mediator of IL-6 production in response to mycobacterial antigen in both THP-1 macrophages and human Schwann cells while human monocyte-derived macrophages needed to be pre-activated with VitD to show the same impact. Parkin also impacted on the constitutive production of MCP-1. The regulatory activity of parkin on cytokine production was found to be independent of the canonical TLR-NF\\u03baB signalling pathway. We also tested association of IL6 and CCL2 gene expression levels in whole blood assays with PARK2 polymorphisms. For both cytokines, we found significant associations with those PARK2 variants that were established leprosy susceptibility factors. Hence, our results show that genetic PARK2 variants that are correlated with leprosy susceptibility are also correlated with production of these cytokines following stimulation with M. leprae sonicate.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Converting

We employ the natural infection of Drosophila with a parasitoid wasp to study energy regulation during immune response. To combat the invasion, the host must produce specialized immune cells (lamellocytes) that destroy the parasitoid egg. We show that a significant portion of nutrients are allocated to differentiating lamellocytes when they would otherwise be used for development. This systemic metabolic switch is mediated by extracellular adenosine released from immune cells. The switch is crucial for an effective immune response. Preventing adenosine transport from immune cells or blocking adenosine receptor precludes the metabolic switch and the deceleration of development, dramatically reducing host resistance. Adenosine thus serves as a signal that the \\u201cselfish\\u201d immune cells send during infection to secure more energy at the expense of other tissues.\\n\",\n          \"Genetic models of ribosome dysfunction show selective organ failure, highlighting a gap in our understanding of cell-type specific responses to translation insufficiency. Translation defects underlie a growing list of inherited and acquired cancer-predisposition syndromes referred to as ribosomopathies. We sought to identify molecular mechanisms underlying organ failure in a recessive ribosomopathy, with particular emphasis on the pancreas, an organ with a high and reiterative requirement for protein synthesis. Biallelic loss of function mutations in SBDS are associated with the ribosomopathy Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, which is typified by pancreatic dysfunction, bone marrow failure, skeletal abnormalities and neurological phenotypes. Targeted disruption of Sbds in the murine pancreas resulted in p53 stabilization early in the postnatal period, specifically in acinar cells. Decreased Myc expression was observed and atrophy of the adult SDS pancreas could be explained by the senescence of acinar cells, characterized by induction of Tgf\\u03b2, p15Ink4b and components of the senescence-associated secretory program. This is the first report of senescence, a tumour suppression mechanism, in association with SDS or in response to a ribosomopathy. Genetic ablation of p53 largely resolved digestive enzyme synthesis and acinar compartment hypoplasia, but resulted in decreased cell size, a hallmark of decreased translation capacity. Moreover, p53 ablation resulted in expression of acinar dedifferentiation markers and extensive apoptosis. Our findings indicate a protective role for p53 and senescence in response to Sbds ablation in the pancreas. In contrast to the pancreas, the Tgf\\u03b2 molecular signature was not detected in fetal bone marrow, liver or brain of mouse models with constitutive Sbds ablation. Nevertheless, as observed with the adult pancreas phenotype, disease phenotypes of embryonic tissues, including marked neuronal cell death due to apoptosis, were determined to be p53-dependent. Our findings therefore point to cell/tissue-specific responses to p53-activation that include distinction between apoptosis and senescence pathways, in the context of translation disruption.\\n\",\n          \"Intracellular calcium cycling is a vital component of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The key structures responsible for controlling calcium dynamics are the cell membrane (comprising the surface sarcolemma and transverse-tubules), the intracellular calcium store (the sarcoplasmic reticulum), and the co-localisation of these two structures to form dyads within which calcium-induced-calcium-release occurs. The organisation of these structures tightly controls intracellular calcium dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of intracellular calcium cycling in three-dimensions (3-D), which incorporates high resolution reconstructions of these key regulatory structures, attained through imaging of tissue taken from the sheep left ventricle using serial block face scanning electron microscopy. An approach was developed to model the sarcoplasmic reticulum structure at the whole-cell scale, by reducing its full 3-D structure to a 3-D network of one-dimensional strands. The model reproduces intracellular calcium dynamics during control pacing and reveals the high-resolution 3-D spatial structure of calcium gradients and intracellular fluxes in both the cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrated the capability of the model to reproduce potentially pro-arrhythmic dynamics under perturbed conditions, pertaining to calcium-transient alternans and spontaneous release events. Comparison with idealised cell models emphasised the importance of structure in determining calcium gradients and controlling the spatial dynamics associated with calcium-transient alternans, wherein the probabilistic nature of dyad activation and recruitment was constrained. The model was further used to highlight the criticality in calcium spark propagation in relation to inter-dyad distances. The model presented provides a powerful tool for future investigation of structure-function relationships underlying physiological and pathophysiological intracellular calcium handling phenomena at the whole-cell. The approach allows for the first time direct integration of high-resolution images of 3-D intracellular structures with models of calcium cycling, presenting the possibility to directly assess the functional impact of structural remodelling at the cellular scale.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"plain language summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The immune response is energetically costly and often requires adaption of the whole organism to ensure it receives enough energy.

Here we find a signal, generated by the host immune cells, which mediates a systemic energy switch. This signal\\u2014adenosine\\u2014suppresses processes driving larval to pupal development of the host, thereby freeing up energy for the immune system. We show that the resulting developmental delay in the fruit fly larvae is crucial for an efficient immune response; without the adenosine signal, resistance to the parasitoid drops drastically. Generation of this signal by immune cells demonstrates that in response to external stressors, the immune system can mobilize reallocation to itself of energy and nutrients from the rest of the organism.\\n\",\n          \"Growth of all living things relies on protein synthesis. Failure of components of the complex protein synthesis machinery underlies a growing list of inherited and acquired multi\\u2014organ syndromes referred to as ribosomopathies. While ribosomes, the critical working components of the protein synthesis machinery, are required in all cell types to translate the genetic code, only certain organs manifest clinical symptoms in ribosomopathies, indicating specific cell-type features of protein synthesis control. Further, many of these diseases result in cancer despite an inherent deficit in growth. Here we report a range of consequences of protein synthesis insufficiency with loss of a broadly expressed ribosome factor, leading to growth impairment and cell cycle arrest at different stages. Apparent induction of p53-dependent cell death and arrest pathways included apoptosis in the fetal brain and senescence in the mature exocrine pancreas. The senescence, considered a tumour suppression mechanism, was accompanied by the expression of biomarkers associated with early stages of malignant transformation. These findings inform how cancer may initiate when growth is compromised and provide new insights into cell-type specific consequences of protein synthesis insufficiency.\\n\",\n          \"The organisation of the membrane and sub-cellular structures of cells in the heart closely controls the coupling between its electrical and mechanical function. Computational models of the cellular calcium handling system, which is responsible for this electro-mechanical coupling, have been developed in recent years to study underlying structure-function relationships. Previous models have been largely idealised in structure; we present a new model which incorporates experimental data describing the high-resolution organisation of the primary structures involved in calcium dynamics. Significantly, the structure of the intracellular calcium store is modelled for the first time. The model is shown to reproduce calcium dynamics in control cells in both normal and abnormal conditions, demonstrating its suitability for future investigation of structure-function relationships. Thus, the model presented provides a powerful tool for the direct integration of experimentally acquired structural data in healthy and diseased cells and assessment of the role of structure in regulating normal and abnormal calcium dynamics.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Immune response is energetically costly [1,2]. Immune cells, upon activation, favor glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation for fast, albeit inefficient, energy generation and macromolecule synthesis [3,4]. This metabolic shift requires extra glucose as glycolysis produces much less ATP than does oxidative phosphorylation [5]. Therefore, at the organismal level, the energy shifts from storage and nonimmune processes towards the needs of the immune system [6\\u20139].\\n\\nRegulation of energy during the immune response is critical\\u2014full response requires a significant amount of energy, and inability to provide it with nutrients can lead to immune system suppression and reduced resistance [10\\u201312]. In mammalian systems, the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\\u03b1, IFN-\\u03b3, IL-1, and IL-6 are released upon recognition of the pathogen and, besides modulating immune functions, they also stimulate energy release [2,13\\u201316]. Immune cells must respond rapidly to the activating signals, and thus they change their metabolism, which involves, at least in mammalian systems, the preferential use of aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect [3,4,17]. The increased demand for energy by the immune system requires, both in vertebrates and invertebrates, adaptation of the whole organism, which is associated with an overall metabolic suppression and a systemic insulin resistance in all tissues except the immune cells [2,12,18]. The importance of the systemic regulation of energy is demonstrated by examples of certain infections leading to depletion of energy reserves (wasting) and eventually death of the organism [15,19]. Despite the importance of the systemic regulation of energy, we have only fragmentary knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of energy during immune response at the organismal level and about the communication between different parts of the organism mediating the shift of energy from storage and growth towards immunity [12,20,21].\\n\\nExtracellular adenosine (e-Ado) is a signal originating from damaged or stressed tissues. Acting as an energy sensor, e-Ado is released from metabolically stressed cells with depleted ATP [22,23] or made from extracellular ATP leaking from damaged tissues [24]. e-Ado then works as a local or systemic hormone, adjusting metabolism by acting either via adenosine receptors or by the uptake into the cells and conversion to AMP activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [24,25]. These actions lead to a suppression of energy consuming processes [22,26\\u201329] and to a release of energy from stores [30].\\n\\nDamaged tissues and metabolically stressed cells are very likely to occur during immune response and thus it is not surprising that elevated levels of e-Ado are also detected, for example, during sepsis in humans [31]. The capacity of e-Ado to regulate energy metabolism, to \\u201cmeasure\\u201d the level of tissue and organismal stress, and to adapt the energy use to the actual situation all make e-Ado a perfect candidate for an energy regulator during immune response. However, the mode of e-Ado action under immune challenge is unclear, as the role of e-Ado in energy regulation has mainly been studied in relation to anoxia in anoxia-tolerant organisms such as turtles and hypoxia and ischemia in rodent models and human patients [22,30], while e-Ado has thus far been associated with mammalian immune response only through its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory function [24,32].\\n\\nWe, and others, have previously shown that adenosine regulatory and signaling network in Drosophila is similar to mammalian systems [33\\u201337]. In addition, we have shown that e-Ado regulates energy metabolism in Drosophila. Increase of e-Ado levels caused by a deficiency of adenosine deaminase-related growth factor A (ADGF-A) leads to hyperglycemia and reduced energy storage [38]. We have also found that the regulation of e-Ado by ADGF-A is particularly important during parasitoid wasp infection in Drosophila larvae; ADGF-A is strongly expressed in immune cells that encapsulate the invading wasp egg [39]. These findings further support a potential role of e-Ado in energy regulation during immune response.\\n\\nHere, we use the parasitoid wasp infection as a model to study the energy regulation during immune reaction. Parasitoid wasps inject their eggs into Drosophila larvae, and if the fly larva does not destroy the egg in time, the hatched wasp larva will consume the host [40]. The fly larva recognizes the egg and mounts a robust immune response that involves proliferation and differentiation of specialized immune cells, lamellocytes, which eventually encapsulate the parasitoid egg. Using this immune response as a model, we traced the dietary glucose destinations, measured selected metabolites and gene expressions, and analyzed host resistance and the impact of the immune response on its development.\\n\\nWe describe here the systemic changes in energy metabolism during the immune challenge and the role of e-Ado in the regulation of these changes. We have found that e-Ado, released from the immune cells, mediates a metabolic switch characterized by the suppression of nutrient storage and developmental growth in favor of the immune defense. This metabolic switch\\u2014a tradeoff between development and defense\\u2014is crucial for the resistance to infection. In Drosophila larvae lacking adenosine signaling, development is not suppressed, and the resistance dramatically drops.\\n\\nThe endoparasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi injects its egg in early third-instar Drosophila larva. The egg, usually hiding in gut folds, is first recognized by the host-circulating hemocytes (Fig 1A) and the recognition triggers immune response [40]. This involves production of specialized cells called lamellocytes (Fig 1A and 1B) within the first 24 h postinfection (hpi; 0 hpi is the time of infection and corresponds to 72 h after egg laying; the time in hpi is also used for the uninfected control). Lamellocytes are then released into circulation, and the egg gets encapsulated with subsequent melanization by 48 hpi (Fig 1A). Production of lamellocytes involves a transient proliferation of prohemocytes in the lymph gland and their terminal differentiation into lamellocytes [41]. The efficiency of egg encapsulation depends on the ability to produce lamellocytes and thus varies among different genetic strains of Drosophila [42,43]. Our model was based on the Canton S strain of Drosophila melanogaster bearing the w1118 mutation (hereafter w), which served as a control genotype in all our experiments (the term \\u201ccontrol\\u201d is reserved hereafter for uninfected situations, i.e., control w means uninfected w larvae). On average, 42% of these w host larvae succeeded to destroy the wasp egg and 38% survived to adulthood while 42% parasitoids developed to adult wasps (Fig 1C).\\n\\nParasitoid-infected third-instar larvae experienced a 15% developmental delay, pupating on average 7 h later than uninfected controls (Fig 1D). Such a delay might result from redistribution of energy from development towards immune defense. We therefore examined various energy aspects during infection.\\n\\nWithout infection, circulating glucose was kept below 0.04 \\u03bcg per \\u03bcg protein (Fig 2A). Both the glycogen and triacylglycerol (TAG) stores kept increasing, while circulating and tissue trehalose levels remained steady (Fig 2A). Trehalose is a nonreducing disaccharide source of glucose, which is liberated by the action of trehalase [44]. To trace the fate of glucose, we employed dietary radiolabeled D[U-14C]-glucose. The glucose-derived 14C became evenly distributed in the larvae among saccharides, proteins, and lipids (Fig 2B). About 84% of 14C was found in developing tissues (Fig 2C). We divided the organism here in a simplified way into the immune system (represented by cellular immunity, the most important defense against parasitoids, including circulating hemocytes and lymph gland), the circulation (hemolymph), and the rest of the tissues representing mainly development, growth, and energy storage.\\n\\nIn infected larvae, the accumulation of TAG and glycogen reserves ceased (Fig 2A). This was accompanied by down-regulation of glycogen synthase (CG6904; FlyBase ID: FBgn0266064) and up-regulation of glycogen phosphorylase expression (CG7254; FlyBase ID: FBgn0004507)(Fig 3A). The amount of tissue trehalose decreased (Fig 2A), and less dietary glucose was incorporated into lipids and proteins (Fig 2B and S2 Fig). These hallmarks of suppressed energy storage and growth were corroborated by reduced incorporation of 14C into developing tissues from 84% in uninfected larvae to 77% at 6 hpi and 63% at 18 hpi (Fig 2C and S2 Fig).\\n\\nThe above effects were associated with hyperglycemia as indicated by elevated hemolymph glucose and 14C at the expense of developing tissues (Fig 2A and 2C). Incorporation of 14C into lipids and proteins (at the whole organism level) was also suppressed during infection (Fig 2B), which was accompanied by down-regulation of specific glycolytic enzyme genes in the fat body (Fig 3B and S3 Fig). The diversion of metabolism from building energy reserves and from fat body glycolysis was thus in agreement with extra 14C in the carbohydrate form and with the increase of circulating glucose and trehalose. Circulating trehalose peaked at 6 hpi (Fig 2A) concomitantly with increased expression of a trehalose transporter in the fat body, the organ where trehalose is produced (Fig 3C).\\n\\nAt the same time, the immune cells changed their behavior during infection in the opposite direction, leading to increased energy consumption. Around one-tenth of 14C is normally allocated to immune cells, leaving almost 90% to the rest of the organism, but immune cells demanded up to one-third of nutrients during immune response (Fig 2C). Expression of several glycolytic genes including lactate dehydrogenase Impl3 (CG10160; FlyBase ID: FBgn0001258) increased both in the circulating hemocytes and in the lymph gland (Figs 3B, S4, and S5). This resembled the glucose-demanding aerobic glycolysis, the Warburg effect, in activated mammalian immune cells. Both the lymph gland and the circulating hemocytes expressed elevated amounts of glucose transporter Glut1 (CG43946; FlyBase ID: FBgn0264574) and trehalose transporter Tret1-1 (CG30035; FlyBase ID: FBgn0050035) mRNAs (Fig 3D). Interestingly, later during infection (12\\u201318 hpi), the circulating hemocytes together with already differentiated lamellocytes strongly increased expression of both Tret1-1 and trehalase (CG9364; FlyBase ID: FBgn0003748) (Fig 3D). This suggests that differentiated immune cells preferentially uptake energy in the form of trehalose, which may be linked to the decline of circulating trehalose after 6 hpi (Fig 2A). These results demonstrate a shift of energy distribution away from storage and growth, first towards circulating glucose and trehalose, and then towards the immune cells (Fig 2).\\n\\nWe have previously shown that e-Ado increases circulating glucose via adenosine receptor (AdoR; CG9753; FlyBase ID: FBgn0039747) signaling [38]. Here, we tested if e-Ado was involved in the observed effects of infection on the metabolic shift. While the circulating glucose increased more than 2-fold during infection in w larvae, this increase was suppressed in adoR (FlyBase ID: FBal0191589) mutant larvae (Fig 4A), indicating that AdoR was indeed necessary for the energy redistribution during infection. Therefore, we compared the number of lamellocytes as a measure of immune response. While w larvae produced 5\\u20136 thousand lamellocytes by 24 hpi, the adoR mutants contained less than a third of this amount (Fig 4B). Yet the adoR mutants were clearly capable of differentiating functional lamellocytes that displayed normal morphology, expressed a lamellocyte-specific MSNF9>GFP marker (FlyBase ID:FBtp0064497), and were capable of encapsulating the wasp egg (Fig 4C and S16 Fig). Therefore, adoR larvae were impaired in efficiency or speed of lamellocyte production, and this corresponded with their reduced resistance against the parasitoid invasion relative to w larvae. Indeed, the adoR mutants were three times less successful at neutralizing the wasp eggs and surviving to adult flies (Fig 4C). Thus, AdoR signaling is crucial for effective immune defense against the parasitoid.\\n\\nThe impaired defense in the adoR mutants was not due to affected recognition of the wasp egg, as the number of plasmatocytes attached to the egg surface within the first few hpi was similar in w and adoR larvae (S7 Fig). Therefore, we tested if shortage of energy could be the problem as suggested by failure to increase circulating sugar levels in adoR larvae (Fig 4A). When we fed these larvae a high-glucose diet (12% instead of the regular 5%), the hemolymph glucose significantly increased even without infection in both w and adoR larvae (Fig 4D). This dietary treatment significantly increased the number of lamellocytes in the infected adoR larvae (Fig 4B), suggesting that it was the lack of energy causing inefficient differentiation of lamellocytes in the absence of AdoR.\\n\\nInterestingly, adding glucose to the diet did not further increase the level of circulating glucose during infection. In fact, the increase induced by infection was greater than that achieved with dietary glucose (Fig 4D), and consistently the number of lamellocytes in infected w larvae was the same on both diets (Fig 4B). Since the glucose increase induced by the dietary treatment was not as high as the one induced by the infection, the number of lamellocytes in adoR did not reach, even on the high-glucose diet, the levels observed in w (Fig 4B). This suggests that the glucose available in circulation is the limiting factor for the lamellocyte differentiation.\\n\\nUpon infection, more glucose was retained in the saccharide fraction in the w larvae (Fig 2B), indicating that this glucose was available for energy needs of the immune response and less used for storage and growth. Little (at 6 hpi) or no (18 hpi) such retention was observed in adoR mutants (Fig 5A and S2 Fig), suggesting that storage and/or growth were not suppressed during infection in the absence of AdoR. This notion was supported by the relative distribution of 14C among individual tissues (Fig 5B). The distribution was the same in uninfected w and adoR animals. The incorporation of 14C did not change at 6 hpi in infected adoR (as opposed to w), and the shift from storage and growth (red part) towards immune cells (blue part) was much smaller in infected adoR compared to w at 18 hpi (Fig 5B). Importantly, the comparison of relative distribution of 14C into tissues was allowed by equal total uptake of 14C-glucose from diet in w and adoR larvae (S8 Fig). Interestingly, the comparison of absolute numbers of 14C entering the system also revealed anorexia during infection (lower uptake of 14C; S8 Fig), supporting a common observation during immune responses [45]. This anorexia did not seem to depend on AdoR. Besides the lymph gland with slightly lower 14C in adoR mutants, the tissue distribution of 14C was similar in uninfected w and adoR larvae at both time points (Fig 5B and S10 Fig).\\n\\nUpon infection, only the brain and imaginal disc complex and fat body of w larvae contained significantly less 14C while hemolymph contained significantly more 14C at 6 hpi (Fig 5B and S9 Fig). While 14C incorporation into brain+discs significantly decreased in w larvae, it did not change in the adoR mutant upon infection (Fig 5B and S9 Fig), demonstrating that the suppression of developmental growth, which occurred during infection, was missing in adoR. This is supported by the measurement of the wing imaginal disc growth. While the growth of discs was significantly delayed in w control upon infection, the delay did not occur in the adoR mutant (Fig 5C). Similarly, the delay in development observed in infected w (as measured by pupation rate) did not occur in adoR, which pupated as there would be no infection (Fig 5D).\\n\\nAt 18 hpi, all tissues were affected by infection, significantly increasing 14C in immune cells and hemolymph and decreasing in the rest (Fig 5B and S9 Fig). In all cases but gut, the changes were significantly smaller in adoR than in w (S10 Fig), indicating that the AdoR signaling was involved in the overall suppression of nonimmune processes.\\n\\nThe missing suppression of development in adoR larvae resulted in shortage of energy available for the immune system as documented first by almost no increase of 14C in the hemolymph at 6 hpi and then by much lower 14C incorporation into the immune cells at 18 hpi compared to infected w larvae (Fig 5B). Weak suppression of nonimmune processes in the absence of AdoR may also be linked to the missing peak of circulating trehalose at 6 hpi (Fig 5E and S2 Fig). Functional AdoR signaling seems to lower glucose transport and to increase trehalose transport in the fat body (suggested by expression levels of the respective transporter genes; S11 Fig), leading to increased trehalose at 6 hpi. The trehalose peak probably serves as a reservoir for fast glucose production, which will be increasingly needed for immune defense. The rapid lamellocyte differentiation is lagging in adoR larvae, likely reflecting lower consumption of trehalose relative to w larvae (Fig 5E).\\n\\nThe AdoR signaling reallocates energy towards immune defense, suggesting that e-Ado is released upon immune challenge. Therefore, we next wanted to determine the source of e-Ado during wasp invasion. We individually knocked down the Equilibrative nucleoside transporters, ENT1 (CG11907; FlyBase ID: FBgn0031250) and ENT2 (CG31911; FlyBase ID: FBgn0263916), which are expressed in Drosophila larvae [36,46]. We delivered RNAi to various tissues utilizing the Gal4-UAS system [47], and as a simple readout we used lamellocyte count at 24 hpi (S12 Fig). Among the tested combinations, only ENT2 knockdown driven by Srp-Gal4 (FlyBase ID: FBtp0020112) in cells of the hematopoietic lineage achieved a reduction in the number of lamellocytes that resembled the effect of adoR deficiency (Figs 4B, 6A, and S12). Srp-Gal4 was expressed in all hematopoietic cells, including the circulating hemocytes and all cells of the lymph gland that also contained precursors of lamellocytes (S13 Fig). In contrast, knocking down ENT2 in already differentiated hemocytes (by Hml-Gal4 and Upd3-Gal4 drivers; FlyBase ID: FBtp0040877 and FBtp0020110) did not affect the lamellocyte number (S12 Fig).\\n\\nENT2 mRNA was abundant in the lymph gland and brain but weakly expressed in circulating hemocytes and virtually undetected in the fat body (Fig 6B). During infection, ENT2 expression increased in all these tissues except the fat body (Fig 6B) and, consistently, ENT2 RNAi delivered using a fat body-specific C7-Gal4 driver did not affect the number of lamellocytes (S12 Fig). The increasing expression of ENT2 during infection in the brain leaves a possibility that the nervous system contributes e-Ado; however, undetectable expression of Srp-Gal4 in the brain, except for minor signal in some nerve cords (S13 Fig), makes the observed effects of ENT2 removal attributable to the immune cells.\\n\\nThe results above suggest that Ado transport from immune cells, including the differentiating ones, is important for efficient lamellocyte differentiation. As in the case of adoR mutation (Fig 4B), the loss of lamellocytes was rescued by increasing dietary glucose in the Srp>ENT2-RNAi larvae (Fig 6A). Similarly to adoR mutation, ENT2 knockdown in immune cells also cancelled changes in nutrient distribution that normally take place in infected w larvae; there was no peak of circulating trehalose at 6 hpi and no increase in circulating glucose (Fig 6C and S2 Fig). The partition of 14C into saccharides, proteins, and lipids also resembled the pattern seen in adoR mutant larvae (compare Fig 6D with Fig 5A and S2 Fig with S14 Fig).\\n\\nTogether, the above data indicate that deficiency in e-Ado release and in its receptor, AdoR, consistently lead to the same failure of energy reallocation during immune challenge. Indeed, like loss of AdoR, knocking down ENT2 also reduced the host resistance against wasp invasion (Fig 6E), while the normal developmental delay observed in w controls upon infection did not occur in Srp>ENT2-RNAi larvae (Fig 6F). Interestingly, pupation occurred earlier in Srp>ENT2-RNAi compared to w or adoR animals even without infection (Fig 6F); the size of pupae was unaffected implying faster growth instead of precocious pupation of Srp>ENT2-RNAi.\\n\\nWhile glycogen storage was suppressed similarly upon infection in adoR mutant and w larvae (Fig 5E), there was no significant difference in glycogen content between infected and uninfected Srp>ENT2-RNAi larvae (Fig 6C). Even more apparent was the effect on lipid storage where the accumulation of TAG in the fat body was suppressed both in w and adoR but not at all in Srp>ENT2-RNAi larvae (Fig 6G). Blocking Ado transport thus led to continued nutrient storage even upon immune challenge, suggesting that energy storage during infection might be regulated by e-Ado independently of AdoR.\\n\\nAn overall metabolic suppression is a common host response to infection [18,12,6]. A likely purpose for the suppression is to conserve energy for the immune response that is energetically costly [2,12]. The defense of the Drosophila larva against the parasitoid wasp requires a rapid production of specialized immune cells (lamellocytes) that encapsulate the parasitoid egg. This has provided us with a unique in vivo model to study the metabolic changes and their regulation during immune response. We show here that the production of lamellocytes is an energetically demanding process, and that a systemic metabolic switch is required for their effective differentiation. This switch includes (1) suppression of energy storage and developmental growth, (2) retaining more energy in circulation, and (3) increased consumption of energy by the immune system (Fig 7).\\n\\nSuppression of energy storage (glycogen and lipids) and suppression of growth, as documented by slower growth of imaginal discs, lead to a developmental delay. We show here that e-Ado is a signal mediating this metabolic switch. Blocking this signal then demonstrates that the metabolic switch is crucial for an effective immune response. Without this signal, development and growth proceed at a normal speed, thus reducing energy available to the immune cells. Insufficiency of immune cells due to the shortage of energy then leads to a drastically reduced resistance against the parasitoid. Experimental interference with e-Ado or its receptor, AdoR, thus demonstrates the importance of tradeoff between development and immune response, and identifies e-Ado as a signal responsible for the switch.\\n\\nBlocking Ado transport from immune cells by knocking down the equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT2 identified the differentiating immune cells as an important source of the signal for the metabolic switch. This suggests that the immune cells could autonomously regulate energy influx based on their acute needs. Ado is a fine sensor of the cellular energy state, as it becomes produced when the ATP:AMP ratio decreases [23]. This scenario is appealing mainly because immune cells dramatically change their metabolism upon activation, leading to increased aerobic glycolysis akin to the Warburg effect [3,4]. Our expression analysis of glycolytic genes, glucose and trehalose transporters, and 14C uptake by immune cells suggested a similar behavior for the differentiating immune cells upon wasp attack. The ability to rapidly react to a metabolic stress could be why ENT2 is strongly expressed in the lymph gland and the brain, both privileged organs from the energy point of view.\\n\\nAdoR signaling is important for the suppression of developmental growth. Normally, infection leads to lower consumption of energy by the brain and imaginal discs (later also by other tissues), but the consumption continues in adoR-deficient larvae as if they were uninfected. At the same time, AdoR signaling seems to lower glucose transport and to increase trehalose transport in the fat body as inferred from expression levels of the respective transporter genes. The fat body is the site where trehalose is produced from glucose [44]; trehalose is then released back to the hemolymph, and more so during infection. The adoR mutation causes a misbalance of glucose and trehalose transport in the fat body, causing more nutrients to be retained there. The effect of AdoR signaling on the fat body combined with the suppression of developmental growth leads to hyperglycemia that in turn ensures enough energy to supply the immune cells. If the growth suppression fails to occur, as in the adoR mutant, the immune cells are unable to compete with developing tissues that consume the majority of energy. By analogy to the selfish brain theory [48], \\u201cselfish\\u201d immune cells may usurp energy to themselves by way of AdoR-mediated silencing of nonimmune processes. Our work thus brings experimental evidence and explains the molecular mechanism for recently published theoretical concept of selfish immune system [49].\\n\\nInterestingly, the AdoR signaling does not mediate the suppression of energy storage (glycogen and TAG) during infection. However, increasing glycogen and TAG stores in infected Srp>ENT2-RNAi larvae with blocked Ado transport from immune cells indicates that the storage suppression is also under e-Ado control but through an AdoR-independent mechanism. Such a mechanism, which needs to be further studied, may involve e-Ado uptake, conversion to AMP by adenosine kinase, and activation of AMPK [25]. The Srp>ENT2-RNAi larvae proceeded faster through development not only during infection but even without infection when compared to control larvae. This suggests that the regulation of energy storage by e-Ado may play a role even during normal development.\\n\\ne-Ado signaling was previously associated with regulation of hemocyte differentiation, and blocking the AdoR signaling was suggested to lower the differentiation in the lymph gland under noninfectious conditions [50]. The hallmark of lamellocyte differentiation upon parasitoid wasp infection is the turning off the Jak-Stat signaling in the medullary zone of the lymph gland containing the prohemocytes [51]. Expression of cytokine Upd3 (CG33542; FlyBase ID: FBgn0053542) is down-regulated, and the ratio of Jak-Stat receptor Domeless (CG14226; FlyBase ID: FBgn0043903) and its negative coreceptor Latran (CG14225; FlyBase ID: FBgn0031055) is switched upon wasp infection leading to turning off the Jak-Stat and to induction of lamellocyte differentiation [52]. The expression patterns of Upd3, Domeless and Latran mRNAs normally and during infection are unaffected both in adoR and Srp>ENT2-RNAi (S15 Fig), indicating that the induction of lamellocyte differentiation is functional in these lines. In addition, the lymph glands develop normally in both adoR and Srp>ENT2-RNAi ([50] and S17 Fig). Our results demonstrate that the adoR and Srp>ENT2-RNAi larvae are capable of lamellocyte differentiation; they are just less effective, and the reason is most likely the lack of energy as indicated by the rescue of this phenotype with extra dietary glucose.\\n\\nAn important part of the global energy switch observed upon parasitoid invasion is the AdoR-mediated suppression of developmental growth. Although AdoR is relatively strongly expressed in imaginal discs [34], we do not know if it is the tissue-autonomous signaling of AdoR, or whether AdoR acts systemically on metabolism as AdoR is also strongly expressed in the larval endocrine glands and brain; both scenarios may apply simultaneously. It is known that the activation of adenosine receptor leads to metabolic suppression\\u2014at the individual cell level, the activation can inhibit growth of tumor cells [26], but it can also cause a systemic suppression during anoxia [28,29] or torpor [27]. Our work demonstrates that the AdoR-mediated suppression plays an important role also during immune response. It will be important to identify the target cells and signaling cascades mediating the observed suppression in future studies.\\n\\nWe show here that the metabolic switch is mediated by e-Ado and that the switch is crucial for an effective immune response. It is of interest to see if this e-Ado role is common to other organisms including humans. e-Ado plays the same role in energy regulation in flies and mammalian systems [30,38]. For example, sepsis is associated with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance as well as with increased e-Ado [31,53], suggesting that e-Ado could indeed mediate the systemic metabolic switch in higher organisms. However, analyzing this role of e-Ado in mammals will be complicated by the existence of multiple adenosine receptors with partly contradicting functions [54,55] and by diverse roles of e-Ado in immunomodulation [24,56,57].\\n\\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that extracellular adenosine, released from immune cells, mediates a systemic metabolic switch leading to suppression of energy storage and developmental growth, thus leaving more energy to the immune cells. This switch is crucial for the effective immune response and blocking adenosine signaling drastically reduces host resistance to the pathogen. This may resemble a selfish brain theory in a way that the immune system, like the brain, is a privileged part of the organism, capable of suppressing energy consumption by other tissues in its own interest. Such a selfish immune system [49] would use e-Ado as a signal to appropriate extra energy resources during immune challenge.\\n\\nAll strains were backcrossed at least ten times to w1118 genetic background; w1118 was used as a control in all experiments. adoR mutant was homozygous for adoR1 mutation (FBal0191589). RNAi lines originated from VDRC: UAS-Ent1-RNAi (ID 109885) and UAS-Ent2-RNAi (ID 100464). SrpD-Gal4, Upd3-Gal4, and MSNF9-GFP were obtained from Michele Crozatier, Hml\\u0394-Gal4 from Bruno Lemaitre and C7-Gal4 from Marek Jindra. Flies were grown on cornmeal medium (8% cornmeal, 5% glucose, 4% yeast, 1% agar) at 25\\u00b0C. For dietary treatment, larvae were transferred upon infection to cornmeal diet with 12% instead of 5% glucose. Early 3rd instar larvae were infected by parasitoid wasp L. boulardi. Weak infection (1\\u20132 eggs per larva) was used for resistance and pupation analysis; strong infection (4\\u20137 eggs per larva) was used in all other cases.\\n\\nTo determine pupation rate and resistance to parasitoids, infected and control larvae were placed into fresh vials (1 experiment = 30 larvae per vial, 3 vials per genotype; 4 independent experiments). Pupation rate was determined by counting newly appeared pupae every 6 h and incremental percentage of number of pupae per total number of infected and control larvae at a particular time point postinfection was plotted; Log-rank survival analysis was used for comparison. For resistance, we first dissected 20 larvae per experiment from each genotype to count fully melanized wasp eggs (winning host) or surviving wasp larvae (winning parasitoid). Second, we counted all emerged adult flies as surviving the infection and flies without any egg (i.e., uninfected individuals) were excluded from the total number in the experiment. Adult wasps emerged from the vial were counted as adult parasitoid winners.\\n\\nExpression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Samples were collected from three independent infection experiments with three technical replicates for each experiment. Expression was normalized to Ribosomal protein Rp49.\\n\\nLarvae were fed either 73 h AEL or 91 h AEL for 20 min a diet containing D[U-14C]-glucose (10.6 Gbq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in yeast. Samples were collected 5 h later. Each sample contained tissues from 30 larvae\\u2014all hemolymph was collected by ripping larvae in PBS, centrifuging them, and dividing them into pelleted hemocytes and hemolymph fractions; brains with attached discs and wing discs, whole guts, whole fat bodies, and lymph glands were separated by dissection, and the rest were used as carcass. Macromolecular fractions were separated from tissue homogenates according to [58] for saccharides and lipids and by TCA treatment for proteins. Part of the homogenate was used for measurement of total absorbed amount of 14C molecules. Number of 14C disintegrations per minute was detected by liquid scintillator.\\n\\nGlucose, trehalose, and glycogen were measured as described [59], using GAGO-20 kit (Sigma). Lipids extracted with chlorophorm:methanol were quantified by HPLC and mass spectrometry.\\n\\nWing discs were dissected from larvae at 90 h AEL (18 hpi), and their size was determined from micrographs by FIJI software.\\n\\nData were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).\\n\\nExtended Materials and Methods are available in S1 Text.\\n\",\n          \"The protein translation machinery encompasses interrelated processes of ribosome biogenesis [1] as well as protein synthesis [2]. Mutations in genes that encode components of this machinery are implicated in a growing list of inherited and acquired disorders termed ribosomopathies. All aspects of cell growth require protein synthesis and deficiency in machinery biogenesis or function can be anticipated to have systemic effects with reduced growth caused by translation insufficiency. This was observed in the Drosophila minutes that were initially identified by diminutive size, and are now known to possess mutations in ribosome related genes [3]. Nevertheless, ribosomopathies present as clinical syndromes with select organ failure, often including the bone marrow [4,5]. The mechanisms dictating which organs are affected by any given ribosomopathy are unknown. Susceptibility to organ failure may reflect specific cell type expression levels or threshold requirements for translation [6]. Developmental requirements during organ expansion [6,7] and functional requirements during cued response to extrinsic signals may add other levels of complexity.\\n\\nMost ribosomopathies are cancer predisposition syndromes. They can be associated with increased risk of hematological malignancies, and solid tumours have also been reported [4]. Numerous studies have linked defects in translational control and ribosome gene dosage to aberrant growth [8,9]. However, studies have primarily discussed cancer progression in the context of increased ribosome biogenesis and/or translation. What precipitates malignancies in a growth-disadvantaged context such as that of a ribosomopathy remains poorly understood.\\n\\nA number of consequences have been noted with loss of the highly conserved ribosome-associated protein SBDS and its orthologs in various model systems with a common thread of deregulated protein synthesis. There are several lines of evidence indicating that SBDS functions in ribosome metabolism [10,11], specifically with eukaryotic initiation factor 6 (EIF6) and elongation factor Tu GTP binding domain containing 1 (EFTuD1) protein [12,13]. EIF6 is required for binding and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit [14,15] and has been shown to block ribosome subunit joining for formation of the 80S ribosome [16,17]; hence EIF6 is considered to limit translation initiation [18]. Gain of function mutations in the yeast ortholog of Eif6 rescued the severe slow-growth phenotype of SBDS-null yeast strains (sdo1\\u0394) and EFTuD1-null yeast strains (ria1\\u0394) [13,19]. The removal of EIF6 from the 60S ribosomal subunit was shown to require the GTPase activity of EFTuD1 [19]. Further, genetic and protein interactions between homologs of EFTuD1 and SBDS have been demonstrated [11,12,20,21]. The current working molecular model is that SBDS acts with EFTuD1 to promote EIF6 removal from the 60S ribosomal subunit [12,22,23].\\n\\nShwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a recessive ribosomopathy caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in SBDS [24]. SDS is a multisystem disorder presenting typically within the first year of life with failure to thrive, chronic infection and low blood counts [25]. Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and blood lineage cytopenia (most often neutropenia) are defining features [26]. Other clinical findings include skeletal defects, decreased brain volume and cognitive impairment [27\\u201330]. SDS is associated with high risk of hematological malignancies (up to 30%) [31]; more recently, early onset solid tumours have also been observed, notably including pancreatic carcinoma [32\\u201334]. The exocrine pancreas has amongst the highest requirements for translation in the body as the site of reiterative digestive enzyme production [35]; SDS pancreatic dysfunction is characterized by severe digestive enzyme deficiency [36].\\n\\nStudies in both patient-derived cell lines [21,37\\u201339] and animal models of SDS [12,13,21,23,40,41] have demonstrated a role for SBDS in ribosome maturation and ribosome subunit joining. Furthermore, decreased global translation was demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with disease-associated mutations of Sbds [41] and in human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines depleted for SBDS by siRNA [42]. It remains to be determined how SDS-related disruptions in translation manifest as acute dysfunctions in select organs.\\n\\nSenescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest associated in vivo with tumour suppression and aging. In the context of tumours, senescence is considered to act as a rapid response to aberrant growth, particularly downstream of oncogene induction (e.g. RAS activation) [43]. Engagement of tumour suppressors including p53, CDKN2A (p16INK4A), pRB [43], TGF\\u03b2 and CDKN2B (p15INK4B) [44,45], can initiate this permanent arrest of the cell cycle that is associated with quiescent cells that secrete inflammatory cytokines (senescence-associated secretory phenotype) and express senescence-associated \\u03b2\\u2013galactosidase activity (SA\\u03b2G) [43].\\n\\nHere we sought to identify in vivo mechanisms underlying pancreas dysfunction, in comparison to other organs, in SDS. We used constitutive and targeted mouse models to establish the timing and type of organ responses to Sbds mutation. Specifically, we show the dependence of many responses on p53 and that SDS-related translation insufficiency induces a senescent cell cycle arrest through the induction of Tgf\\u03b2 and p15Ink4b in the murine exocrine pancreas. Our study provides new insights into organ selectivity and tumorigenic potential in ribosomopathies.\\n\\nMouse models with disease-associated missense (R126T) and null (\\u2013) alleles, SbdsR126T/R126T and SbdsR126T/\\u2013, displayed severe growth impairment and did not survive birth (S1 Table; [46]). Models demonstrated complete penetrance and consistent genotype-phenotype correlations, with more severe and earlier onset of disease phenotypes in the SbdsR126T/\\u2013embryos compared to SbdsR126T/R126T embryos (Fig 1). Heterozygous carriers of either the Sbds\\u2212or SbdsR126T alleles were indistinguishable from wildtype, consistent with a recessive mode of inheritance for SDS. Embryos were visibly smaller by two weeks gestation and at E18.5 were, on average, 38% (SbdsR126T/\\u2013) and 56% (SbdsR126T/R126T) of age-matched controls by mass (Figs 1A and S1A). Embryo length was also reduced (S1C Fig).\\n\\nSDS mouse models recapitulated several features observed in human disease. Mutations in Sbds are associated with defects in hematopoiesis [47]. In the fetal period, the liver is the primary site of definitive hematopoiesis. In the SbdsR126T/R126T model near birth (E18.5), histopathology indicated decreased granulocytes in portal areas of the liver as well as pronounced bone marrow hypocellularity, with increased severity in the SbdsR126T/\\u2013model (Fig 1B).\\n\\nSDS is also characterized by decreased ossification and delayed bone growth [27,48]. No gross skeletal defects were apparent in the constitutive models [41]; however, ossification was reduced in the metacarpals at late gestation (Fig 1C). In severe cases, asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy has been observed in SDS [49,50], presumably due in part to the skeletal dystrophy. Beyond this, lung pathology has not been specifically reported in SDS patients. We did observe a severe decrease in saccule expansion in the late fetal lung, despite presence of lung developmental stage biomarkers (S2A Fig).\\n\\nA defining morphological feature of SDS is a small, fat-replaced pancreas [25,27,30]; we previously showed that pancreatic growth impairment, dysfunction and lipomatosis manifest only in the postnatal period [51].\\n\\nTranslation insufficiency impacts all tissues, and all ribosomopathies are associated with poor overall growth. To further investigate the observed decreases in granulocytes in the liver and hypoplasia of the bone marrow compartment we assessed the abundance of hematopoietic progenitors in the fetal liver of the SDS mouse models. Primary myocult cultures derived from E14.5 fetal livers revealed markedly decreased levels of all myeloid lineage progenitors in both the SbdsR126T/R126T and SbdsR126T/\\u2013models (S3 Fig). Decreased levels of granulocytes in the SbdsR126T/\\u2013model were also determined by flow cytometry of fetal liver cells (E16.5, S4A Fig). Unlike ribosome deficiency models with dominant inheritance [52\\u201354], erythrocyte levels prior to birth (E18.5) were normal in both mouse models (S4B Fig), consistent with observations in SDS patients [31].\\n\\nIn contrast to other organs, Sbds mutations resulted in severe proliferation defects with pyknotic nuclei and apoptosis (detected by TUNEL staining) in the developing brain by E11.5 in both SbdsR126T/\\u2013and SbdsR126T/R126T models (Fig 2A). At E14.5, TUNEL staining was very prominent in the intermediate zone and bromodeoxyuridine labeling further indicated poor growth of neuronal progenitors in the ventricular zone of the developing cortices (Fig 2B). By E18.5, the brain showed multifocal lesions of necrotic neurons (S5 Fig). We did not observe an increase in TUNEL staining in other tissues at E18.5, including the liver and bone marrow, beyond what was observed in controls (S6 Fig).\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the constitutive SDS models did not survive birth. Using a conditional knockout allele (CKO) in conjunction with a pancreas-specific Cre driver (Ptf1aCre) to circumvent lethality, we previously showed that biallelic loss-of-function mutations in Sbds result in a very small pancreas (53% of controls, relative to body mass [51]) with severe atrophy of the acinar component of the adult pancreas. This phenotype included a dramatic depletion of zymogen granules, the specialized vesicles that house digestive enzymes in pancreatic acinar cells. Furthermore, in contrast to the developing brain, poor pancreatic growth was not explained by apoptosis [51].\\n\\nGiven the loss of zymogen granules and acinar cell hypoplasia with a persistent absence of cell death markers, we considered that a senescent cell-cycle arrest might explain atrophy of the SDS pancreas. Several acinar cells of the SDS pancreas were positive for SA\\u03b2G activity by 20 days of age, becoming more prominent by 30 days of age (Fig 3A). With this evidence of senescence, we next investigated the nature of this response by performing transcript analyses with reverse-transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR of a curated cellular senescence panel of genes. Pancreas samples from littermate control-mutant pairs were compared at two time points prior to the pronounced SA\\u03b2G activity (Fig 3B, S2 Table). SDS pancreas transcripts showed a suite of changes that were, consistent with the literature, indicative of a senescent-associated cell cycle arrest and secretory program [55\\u201357]. We then further investigated targets of the p53/p21Cip1 and Tgf\\u03b2/p15Ink4b networks with additional samples and time points (Fig 3C). We detected markedly increased expression of p15Ink4b (Cdkn2b) along with Tgf\\u03b2 together with low Myc expression at 15 and 25 days of age (Fig 3C). Increased expression of p21Cip (Cdkn1a) occurred at the early time point of 15 days. Consistent with low Myc levels being permissive for p15Ink4b induction by Tgf\\u03b2 [58], decreases in Myc transcript levels were noted already at one-week of age, preceding increases in Tgf\\u03b2 and p15Ink4b (Fig 3C). An increase in p53 transcript expression (3.70 fold, relative to controls), a known mediator of the senescence response [43], also coincided with the onset of SA\\u03b2G activity (Fig 3C).\\n\\nProtein expression analyses of control-mutant littermate pairs from several litters paralleled the transcript changes in the SbdsP\\u2013/R126T pancreas with changes in Myc and Tgf\\u03b2 signalling (Fig 4A). Steady-state protein levels of Myc and Tgf\\u03b2 were consistently reduced and higher in mutants, respectively (Fig 4A). Tgf\\u03b2 signalling is propagated by phosphorylation of the Smad proteins by Tgf\\u03b2 receptors [59]. We noted less Smad3 phosphorylation, but more Smad2 phosphorylation in mutants than in controls (Fig 4A). We also observed increased transcript levels for Tgf\\u03b2 receptors, TgfbrII and TgfbrIII, which can be upregulated during increased Tgf\\u03b2 signalling [60] (Fig 3C).\\n\\nExpression of several factors implicated in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype [55,56,61] beyond Tgf\\u03b2, were also elevated. These included extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin (Fn1), osteonectin (Sparc) and collagen (Colla1) as well as innate immunity genes (e.g. Irf5, Irf7 and Nfkb1) and insulin growth factor binding proteins (Igfbp5 and Igfbp7) (Fig 3B; S2 Table), consistent with a senescence program.\\n\\nNotably, indicators of replicative- and oxidative stress-induced senescence (e.g. Sod1 and Akt1, respectively [43]) were not elevated (S2 Table). Further, that expression of proto-oncogenes Akt1, Hras and Kras as well as Myc trended downwards or were reduced refuted an oncogene-induced senescence response (Fig 3B; S2 Table).\\n\\nTgf\\u03b2 is a known driver of epithelial to mesenchymal transition [59] so we also considered that this process may be occurring in the SDS pancreas. We did observe indicators of dedifferentiation in the mature SDS pancreas (see below); however E-cadherin (Cdh1) transcript levels were not significantly reduced at young ages (Fig 3C).\\n\\nTo determine if the molecular signature of the pancreas senescence represented a common response to Sbds-ablation, we investigated whether cyclin inhibitors, Tgf\\u03b2, and Myc transcript level changes were evident in tissues of the constitutive SDS model (SbdsR126T/R126T). A marked increase in p21Cip transcript levels in the brain at E14.5 was observed when apoptosis was detected (Fig 3D). At this same early time point, Tgf\\u03b2 expression was not altered in either mutant fetal brain or liver even though both organs manifested phenotypes (Fig 3D). Tgf\\u03b2 expression was low in bone (Fig 3D) and unchanged in lung at E18.5 (S2B Fig). By E18.5, Tgf\\u03b2 expression was elevated in the SDS mouse brain (Fig 3D), likely a late response to brain damage [62]. No changes in p15Ink4b or Myc expression levels were observed in fetal liver, lung, bone or cartilage tissues (Fig 3D; S2B Fig). These findings are consistent with Tgf\\u03b2/p15Ink4b-mediated senescence being a specific response of the pancreas to Sbds deficiency.\\n\\np53 is a known driver of senescent cell cycle arrest [57,63] and increased levels of p53 have been reported in SDS patients [64]. Moreover, studies of ribosomal gene haploinsufficiency have implicated p53 as a key factor in response to ribosome dysfunction [54,65]. We observed increased steady-state levels of p53 protein in the SDS mouse pancreas by immunoblotting (3 weeks of age, Fig 4B). Immunohistochemistry for p53 (15 days of age, prior to the detection of SA\\u03b2G staining, Fig 4C) specifically highlighted nuclei of acinar cells, but not islet cells (Fig 4C). To determine if the senescence in the SDS pancreas is p53-dependent we bred the SDS pancreas model to a Trp53\\u2013/\\u2013mouse.\\n\\nComplete genetic ablation of p53 alleviated the phenotypes of the SDS pancreas. SbdsP\\u2013/R126T;Trp53\\u2013/\\u2013animals demonstrated a notable improvement in pancreas mass as compared with SbdsP\\u2013/R126T;Trp53+/\\u2013animals (Fig 5A). Growth improvement was also evident at the histological level as acinar hypoplasia and fat infiltration did not occur in Sbds/Trp53 double mutants in direct contrast to single Sbds mutants (Fig 5B). The molecular signature associated with senescence in the SDS model pancreas was no longer detected; specifically Tgf\\u03b2, and p15Ink4b transcripts were not elevated and Myc transcript levels were not decreased (Fig 5C) at 25 days of age. Further, elevated SA\\u03b2G activity was not detected at 32 days of age (S7 Fig).\\n\\nBy one month of age, the architecture of the acinar epithelium in Sbds/Trp53 double deficient pancreata appeared disordered with many apoptotic cells evident by two months of age (Fig 5B). The morphology was consistent with early stages of acinar-ductal metaplasia. By 60 days of age, we had already noted that some acinar cells in the SDS model pancreas were positive for transcription factors Hes1 and Pdx1, both of which are associated with dedifferentiation (Fig 5B) [66]. With complete ablation of p53, staining of acinar cells with these dedifferentiation markers became widespread (Fig 5B). In contrast, we did not detect changes in islet structure, nor did islets contain apoptotic cells, consistent with our previous observation that mutations in Sbds specifically impact the acinar compartment of the pancreas [51].\\n\\nThe absence of p53 further revealed translation-insufficiency as a consequence of Sbds loss-of-function. A long established feature of ribosomal deficiency includes small cell size [7], a phenotype noted for the acinar cells of the Sbds/Trp53-double deficient pancreata. Quantification of micrographs of doubly deficient pancreas tissue revealed a nuclei count increase per acinar area compared to Trp53\\u2013/\\u2013controls (with Sbds), indicating more cells per area (and hence a decreased cell size; Fig 6A). Correspondingly, a smaller mean acinus diameter was also evident in the double mutant micrographs (Fig 6B).\\n\\nDespite this indication of ribosomal deficiency, Sbds/Trp53 double mutants demonstrated a substantial rescue of digestive enzyme expression and zymogen granule abundance. In fact, SDS pancreas lysates showed qualitatively different protein expression patterns that became similar to controls when p53 was absent (Fig 6C). Although amylase expression remained low, increases in protease (carboxypeptidase) expression at three weeks (Fig 6D) as well as restoration of zymogen granules by one week (Fig 6E) in the absence of p53 supported improvement in exocrine function.\\n\\nWe previously suggested that loss of Sbds results in a moderate decrease in 80S monosome peak levels compared to littermate controls [51]. Corresponding increases in free ribosomal subunit levels were not apparent as would be expected if ribosome production was maintained, whereas quantification of the 80S monosome peak levels in the polysome profiles of mutant pancreata showed that the modest decrease normalized to that of controls with ablation of p53 (Figs 6F and S8).\\n\\nIn contrast to senescence and its molecular signature that included Tgf\\u03b2, p15Ink4b and Myc, p53-dependence was not specific to the pancreas as loss of p53 impacted many phenotypes of the SDS mouse model. Although the lethality and growth impairment with reduced mass in the constitutive SDS mouse embryo was not improved (S1 Table; S1 Fig), loss of p53 had a restorative effect on blood progenitor levels (Fig 7A; S3 Table) and led to reduced apoptosis in the early SDS mouse brain to non-detectable levels (Fig 7B). As in the pancreas, polysome profiles are perturbed in SbdsR126T/R126T fetal livers, however loss of p53 resulted in only modest effects, with 80S monosome levels remaining far short of control levels (Figs 7C and S8).\\n\\nMutation of factors implicated in ribosome metabolism and translation lead to dramatic consequences for growth [3,8,9,67,68]. Our findings support the classification of SDS as a ribosomopathy [12,69]. Constitutive and targeted mouse models with SDS-associated Sbds alleles demonstrated severe growth impairment at both the organismal and organ levels. Mitogens were decreased in the SDS pancreas including low levels of the proto-oncogene Myc, a key regulator of exocrine pancreas expansion and acinar cell maintenance [70]. Moreover, arrest at the cell cycle level was evident with increased expression of cyclin inhibitors, senescence in the pancreas, and decreased BrdU-incorporation in the developing brain. With respect to direct evidence of a perturbation in ribosome metabolism, polysome analyses indicated a decrease in the proportion of 80S monosome levels in Sbds-ablated mutants relative to age-matched controls, with a notable difference in magnitude between the pancreas and liver. Although a subunit joining problem has been proposed previously in the context of Sbds mutations [12,21,37], our results are more consistent with an overall decrease in ribosome biogenesis, at least in the SDS pancreas. Finally, as observed in other ribosomopathies [54,65,71,72], we observed stabilization of p53 protein and increased Trp53 transcript levels in the SDS pancreas.\\n\\nConstitutive ablation of Sbds in the mouse resulted in deficits in the hematopoietic and skeletal compartments, consistent with disease [25]. We previously demonstrated that targeted ablation of Sbds in the pancreas recapitulated all known SDS phenotypes of that organ [51]. Here we further identified a severe brain phenotype in constitutive models, with decreased proliferation in undifferentiated cells as well as pervasive cell death in differentiating neurons. These neural cell losses likely contribute to the perinatal lethality of the constitutive models. SDS is associated with cognitive impairment; imaging indicates reduced brain volume in patients [29,73] and approximately 20% of children with SDS meet criteria for intellectual disability [28] amongst other neurodevelopmental/behavioural concerns [27,28,74,75]. Neural cell death in the mouse occurred by p53-dependent apoptosis, consistent with neurological phenotypes observed in other ribosomopathy models [76\\u201378].\\n\\nRibosome biogenesis and translational control have a significant impact on cell-cycle progression [79\\u201381], therefore it is not surprising that cells with aberrant ribosome biogenesis and/or translation exhibit cell cycle arrest. However, while SDS-associated genotypes resulted in apoptosis in the fetal brain, senescence was observed in the postnatal pancreas. Given reports that Sbds loss may result in irregularities of the mitotic spindle [82,83], we considered that loss of Sbds could involve a DNA damage-induced senescence response. However, transcripts for DNA damage response factors Atm, Chek1 and Chek2 (S2 Table) were not upregulated. The senescence cell cycle arrest involved the p53/p21Cip1 and Tgf\\u03b2/p15Ink4b networks. Tgf\\u03b2 is a key member of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, with roles in both the establishment and maintenance of senescence [57]. Select activation of the Smad effector proteins to relay the Tgf\\u03b2 signalling cascade is context specific [84]; our findings indicated Smad2 is involved in mediating Tgf\\u03b2 senescence in the SDS pancreas.\\n\\nSenescence is considered a hallmark of premalignant tumours [85]. A Tgf\\u03b2/p15Ink4b-mediated senescent response has been observed in the context of tumour suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma human cell lines [45] and in lymphomas [44]. Senescence can, over time, promote malignant transformation in neighbouring cells due to the chronic secretion of inflammatory cytokines that are part of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype [86]. Although we have not observed tumour formation up to 14 months in our mice, acinar cells did express markers of dedifferentiation and in light of recent reports of early onset, aggressive pancreatic cancers in SDS patients [32,34], we argue that senescent cells present in the SDS pancreas could contribute to malignant transformation.\\n\\nThat senescence and the underlying pathway involving Tgf\\u03b2 were not invoked in other organs of the constitutive SDS model highlighted the diversity of outcomes with loss of Sbds. At the same time, both pancreatic senescence and neural apoptosis were abrogated with genetic depletion of p53, implicating p53 as a key mediator of the response to Sbds loss in these two tissues. In the pancreas, we detected stabilization of p53 expression, detectable by 15 days of age, specifically in nuclei of acinar cells. Moreover, we discovered that the characteristic pancreatic phenotypes in SDS are extensively p53-dependent, including organ morphology and the shutdown of the zymogen granule proteome which was evident at the transcription level.\\n\\nA recent zebrafish model of SDS, generated via morpholino-mediated knockdown of homolog sbds (sbds-MO), demonstrated deficits in pancreatic progenitor proliferation that were phenocopied by ablation of ribosomal constituent proteins, highlighting hypersensitivity of the pancreas compartment to mutations in ribosome-associated genes [40,87].\\n\\nThe absence of p53 did not constitute the rescue of overall growth or perinatal survival of the SDS mouse model highlighting p53-dependent and p53-independent aspects of SDS pathology (as were reported for the zebrafish model [40]). Specifically, the apparent improvements in the Sbds/Trp53 pancreas double mutant phenotypes, were accompanied by a decrease in acinar cell size (a hallmark of translation insufficiency) supporting that protein synthesis remained compromised. Moreover, the profound 80S monosome loss in fetal liver cells (Fig 7) was not recovered with ablation of p53. We conclude that p53 is responding to Sbds deficiency by initiating cell cycle arrest (apoptosis or senescence) with some benefits. However, how the SDS-translation insufficiency triggers p53 activation, or how p53 activation achieves the apparent changes in phenotypes is not clear, perhaps through disturbed production or threshold shift of some critical checkpoint factor(s). With regard to the synthesis of specific proteins, we did note absence of recovery of amylase protein synthesis despite some resurgence of amylase transcript levels in the double mutant (Figs 5C and 6D).\\n\\nIn the pancreas, loss of Sbds is accompanied by cell cycle arrest and reduction of the zymogen granule transcriptome, leading to organ failure. Genetic ablation of Trp53 attenuated the response with rescued growth and increased staining for dedifferentiation markers. It remains to be determined what alternative network(s) may signal the apoptosis that was subsequently observed in absence of p53. Overall, our findings indicate a cellular imperative to shut down cells with disrupted ribosome metabolism, consistent with reports of protective cell shutdown in other ribosomopathy models [6,71].\\n\\nCan the study of the Sbds-deficient models inform a key question of what dictates organ hypersensitivity to ribosome dysfunction? Robust and ubiquitous expression argues against Sbds expression levels being the limiting factor directly underlying the varied organ responses in SDS [24,46]. The responses of organs to the SDS-translation deficiency varied in both timing and molecular signature. However, despite these differences, many aspects of the brain, blood and pancreas pathologies are all downstream of p53. Our study suggests that the perceived organ paucity in ribosomopathies stems in part from a disparity in molecular responses to translation dysfunction, likely downstream of p53 activation. Such responses, with dependence on cell type, can thus result in vastly different tissue outcomes.\\n\\nAll animal experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, with approval of procedures by The Animal Care Committee of the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics, Toronto, AUP #0093. The generation of constitutive SDS and SDS pancreas mouse models was described elsewhere [46,51]. Heterozygous carriers of either the missense (R126T) or null (\\u2013) mutation were indistinguishable from wildtype littermates. All mouse lines were maintained on a C57BL/J6 background and no gender effects were observed. Excision of the floxed CKO allele was achieved by breeding with the Ptf1aCre mouse [88]. The p53 deficient strain B6.129S2-Trp53tm1Tyj/J (The Jackson Laboratory) was bred onto Sbds mutant lines for loss of p53 function studies. For embryonic staging, the morning of a vaginal plug was counted as embryonic day (E) 0.5. Mice were euthanized by decapitation, cervical dislocation or CO2 inhalation. Genotyping of DNA from tail samples was performed with the REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR Kit (Sigma) using primers as previously described [51].\\n\\nFlash frozen tissues were lysed in Polysome Buffer (100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris\\u2013HCl pH9.0, 1% Triton X\\u2013100 and 1% sodium deoxycholate in diethylpyrocarbonate\\u2014treated water) on ice using a polytron. Insoluble cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 X g for 15 min at 4\\u00b0C. Cyclohexamide (0.1 mg/mL) and heparin (1 mg/mL) were added to the supernatant, and equal amounts of RNA (determined by A260 using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer) were loaded onto a 10\\u201350% sucrose gradient (100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH9.0). Sucrose gradients were subjected to ultracentrifugation (151,000 X g for 2 hours at 4\\u00b0C) prior to fractionation using a density gradient fractionation system (Brandel). UV absorbance (A254) was recorded using PeakTrak software (Teledyne Isco). Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 as described [89]. Individual peak/compartment areas were expressed relative to the total AUC of the profile.\\n\\nFor paraffin embedding, organs were dissected and fixed overnight in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde prior to processing into paraffin blocks. Sections with thickness of 5 \\u03bcm were used. Safranin O (counterstained with Fast Green) staining was performed by the pathology core at the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics. For immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval was achieved by boiling in citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH6.0), endogenous peroxidases were blocked with 6% H2O2, and non-specific epitopes were blocked with 5\\u201310% goat serum. Antibodies used are given in S4 Table; antibody binding was visualized using diaminobenzidine reagent (Sigma). For senescence-associated \\u03b2\\u2013galactosidase activity staining assays, fresh tissue was embedded and frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek) as per supplier instructions. Frozen tissues were sectioned as 8 \\u03bcm slices. Senescence staining was performed at pH5.5 as previously described [90]. Apoptosis was detected on paraffin sections by TUNEL assay either using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche) as per supplier\\u2019s instructions (fluorescein visualization) or by the pathology core at the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics (diaminobenzidine visualization). 5\\u2013bromodeoxyuridine (50 \\u03bcg/g, BD Biosciences) was injected in staged pregnant females 24 hours prior to embryo dissection at E14.5. 5\\u2013bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was detected using the BrdU In Situ Detection Kit (BD Biosciences). For cell size measurements, nuclei and acini from at least 3 non-overlapping micrographs taken at 40X magnification from 4 biological replicates were counted and measured.\\n\\nOne week old pancreata were dissected and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH7.3). Fixed samples were processed and sectioned for electron microscopy by the joint Advanced Bioimaging Centre of The Hospital for Sick Children and Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.\\n\\nSingle cell suspensions from E14.5 embryo livers were prepared by grinding and filtering tissue through a 40 \\u03bcm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). Cell suspensions were stained with conjugated antibodies against cell surface antigens with a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences) as previously described [91]. Antibodies used were Gr-1, c-kit (FITC-conjugated), Mac-1, and Ter119 (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).\\n\\nSingle cell suspensions from E16.5 embryo livers were prepared by grinding and filtering tissue through a 40 \\u03bcm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). The number of cells per liver was determined by manual counting using a hemocytometer. Suspended cells (1X105 in 0.3 ml Dulbecco\\u2019s Modified Eagle Media) were mixed with 3 ml of methylcellulose media (Stem Cell Technologies) containing recombinant murine stem cell factor, recombinant murine IL-3, recombinant human IL-6 and recombinant human erythropoietin (Stem Cell Technologies), split into thirds and plated on three 35 mm tissue culture plates. Cells were incubated for 7 days at 37\\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and \\u226595% humidity. Colonies of each cell type were identified and counted using a light microscope according to supplier\\u2019s instructions. Counts for all three plates of each cell type were averaged and presented as counts per 80,000 cells plated. At least five embryos of each genotype were investigated.\\n\\nTotal RNA was isolated from RNAlater (QIAGEN) stabilized pancreas tissue (N = 3\\u20134 for each genotype at each time point) or flash frozen tissues (brain, lung, liver, cartilage, bone; N = 4 for each genotype at each time point) using the RNeasy Mini Plus Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer\\u2019s instructions with the addition of 5% \\u03b2\\u2013mercaptoethanol in the homogenizing Buffer RLT Plus. For bone, cartilage and lung, homogenized tissues were first treated with Trizol (Life Technologies) before application to the RNeasy spin columns. Quality control and real-time quantitative PCR was performed as previously described [51]. Results are presented relative to the expression of the optimal control gene (four genes tested for each sample) for that tissue and time point as determined by GeNORM analysis [92]. A significant change was defined as a \\u22652 fold difference with a P\\u2013value <0.05. Oligonucleotide primers are given in S5 Table. Expression levels of 84 cellular\\u2013senescence associated genes were assayed using the SABiosciences Cellular Senescence RT2 Profiler PCR Array (QIAGEN) with total RNA isolated from pancreata of mice at 15 and 25 days of age. A significant change was defined, as per supplier\\u2019s instructions, as a \\u22653 fold difference with a P-value of <0.05. Selected gene results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR of independently prepared cDNA samples with distinct primer sets (with the exception of Cdkn2b where QIAGEN array primers were used).\\n\\nPancreas tissue (~30 mg) from 20 day old mice (prior to fat infiltration) was homogenized in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5) using a polytron over ice. Insoluble components were pelleted by centrifugation (17,000 X g at 4\\u00b0C). Equal amounts of protein (determined by Lowry assay, BioRad) in 2X Laemmli buffer were separated by 12% SDS\\u2013PAGE and either stained with silver salts or Coomassie brilliant blue, or blotted using the Trans\\u2013Blot Turbo Transfer Pack with the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad). Trans-Blot Turbo nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad) were blocked in 5% (w/v) powdered skim milk (5% (w/v) goat serum for Novacastra CM5 p53 antibody) prior to overnight incubation with primary antibodies followed by species appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (S4 Table). Bound antibodies were visualized with Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) on the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System using Image-Lab 4.1 Software (BioRad).\\n\\nAll statistical tests were carried out using R statistical software (R Foundation, from http://www.r-project.org). For T-tests, Welch\\u2019s correction was used to adjust for non-constant variance. Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance were used where data did not show normal distribution. Bonferroni adjusted critical values were used to declare significance, adjusting for the number of comparisons per analysis. Raw P-values are reported.\\n\",\n          \"The cardiac intracellular calcium (Ca2+) handling system is responsible for the control of cellular and organ contraction associated with the heartbeat [1]. Malfunction of this system can directly affect the ability of the heart to work effectively as a pump\\u2013reducing cardiac output and potentially leading to mortality. Moreover, abnormal Ca2+ handling dynamics has been increasingly linked to the development of arrhythmogenic triggers in the myocardium [2\\u20134], through two-way coupling between the electrical and Ca2+ handling systems.\\n\\nCa2+ handling in cardiac myocytes is regulated by multiple ion channels, pumps and transporters. During the cellular electrical action potential (AP) associated with excitation, an influx of Ca2+ through opening of the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs\\u2014carrying flux JCaL) triggers a significant release of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ store (the sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR) through opening of the Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs\\u2014carrying flux Jrel). This process is referred to as Ca2+-induced- Ca2+-release (CICR) [5]. The Ca2+ released from the SR binds with the contractile myofilaments in the bulk intracellular space\\u2014the cytoplasm\\u2014facilitating cellular contraction. During relaxation, the Ca2+ concentration in the SR is restored from the cytoplasm through the flux Jup, carried by the SERCA Ca2+ pump; Ca2+ is removed from the cell primarily by the sodium- Ca2+-exchanger (NCX\\u2013carrying flux JNaCa) and also through the membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA\\u2014carrying flux JpCa). This completes the cardiac cellular Ca2+ cycle associated with electrical activation and contraction.\\n\\nThe LTCCs are found in clusters along the surface membrane and transverse-tubules (TTs)\\u2014invaginations of the sarcolemmal membrane responsible for delivering the AP into the interior of the cell. PMCA and NCX are distributed on the surface sarcolemmal membrane and the TTs. On the SR membrane there are clusters of RyRs [6] and continuously distributed SERCA proteins. Critical for CICR is the spatial arrangement of the TT network and the junctional portion of the SR (jSR) to form a microdomain, termed the dyad, to co-localise LTCCs and RyRs on the two membranes. There are thousands of dyads within a cell, and the bulk of the SR forms a network like structure (nSR) connecting the distributed jSRs.\\n\\nEmploying serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) we have previously determined the 3-D organisation of the TTs and SR in a large animal model, the sheep, revealing details of the network organisation and jSR morphology and importantly the relationship with the TT network to form dyads [7]. Multiple groups have demonstrated that the TTs and related structures are remodelled in disease conditions [7\\u201314] and we have additionally shown that the SR structure is also perturbed in heart failure [7]. These observations highlight the potential importance of structure-function relationships at the sub-cellular scale in Ca2+ dynamics associated with cardiac arrhythmia and perturbed contraction; the precise nature and impact of these relationships requires further investigation.\\n\\nComputational modelling is a complementary approach to experimental research, and has been successfully applied to provide insight into numerous cardiac phenomena, such as pacemaker activity (e.g., [15]) and the functional impact of pathophysiological ion channel remodelling (e.g., [16]). Recently, computational models which explicitly account for spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics have been developed and successfully reproduced phenomena including Ca2+ transient alternans and spontaneous Ca2+ release [17\\u201341]. Such models are in general idealised (with an idealised structure and dyad distribution), but some have used imaging data to distribute RyRs throughout the cell or cell-portion [17,18,22,39]; Other models have been created of small regions of the cell (e.g. the volume surrounding a single TT or even a single dyad) and have integrated more detailed imaging data [29,31,32,37]. However, a spatio-temporal Ca2+ handling model which accounts for realistic SR structure, TT structure and dyad distribution at the whole-cell scale has not yet been developed and involves significant challenges. Nevertheless, the potential advantages offered by such a model\\u2013providing a method to directly study variability in structure-function relationships\\u2013remain an attractive prospect.\\n\\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to develop an approach to overcome the challenges of modelling spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics using the experimentally reconstructed 3-D structures for the TT and SR at the whole-cell scale. We demonstrate that the approaches developed are sufficient to capture spatio-temporal calcium dynamics with a realistic network SR structure and membrane fluxes distributed according to the sarcolemma/TTs. We additionally report how this model can be used to reproduce Ca2+ transient alternans and spontaneous release events during perturbed rapid pacing as a demonstration of its suitability for future research, and provide preliminary analysis of the importance of structure-function relationships underlying cardiac cellular dynamics. This model (provided in S1 Code) therefore provides a powerful tool to understand structure-function relationships in physiological and pathophysiological cardiac electro-mechanics.\\n\\nThe development of a computational model to achieve the goal of simulating spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics with realistic structure and fluxes requires multiple steps: first, the selected image-based dataset describing structure of the TTs and nSR (Fig 1) must be processed to (a) identify and segment the dyads and (b) construct geometry grids suitable for numerical simulation; second, an idealised model for spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics must be updated to include these new structures. A major feature of this approach is processing of the SR reconstruction for simulation.\\n\\nDetails of image acquisition using SBF-SEM (FEI Quanta 250 FEG SEM equipped with a Gatan 3View ultramicrotome) and methods for the 3-D reconstruction of the TT and SR structure have been described fully elsewhere [7]. In brief, tissue was extracted from the sheep left ventricle and immediately fixed and prepared for SBF-SEM [42]. The voxel size of the acquired data was 13.5 nm /pixel in the x-y plane and 50 nm in the z-direction. The region within a cardiac myocyte for which the dyad positional data was generated for this study is indicated in Fig 1A. The staining technique employed allowed clear delineation of the TT and SR features (Fig 1A\\u20131C). Segmentation of the SR subsequently allowed the network SR (nSR) to be distinguished from the jSR \\u2018patches\\u2019. 3-D reconstruction of both the TTs and SR morphology ([43]) within the defined region enabled identification of jSR along TTs forming putative dyads (Fig 1D\\u20131F). The position of each dyad was marked with a sphere (Fig 1) to build up a 3-D distribution grid through 357 consecutive slices.\\n\\nThe resolution at which the images were acquired, 13.5nm \\u00d713.5nm \\u00d7 50nm, is impractical for computational modelling at the whole-cell scale. Computational grids created for numerical simulation were down-sampled to a resolution of 350nm \\u00d7 350nm \\u00d7 350nm following processing at the full resolution.\\n\\nFirst, the reconstruction of the SR at full resolution was smoothed and cleaned (Fig 3A). This was the baseline geometry to which the down-sampled geometry was mapped. The primary challenge in modelling SR structure is due to its thin cross section: resolutions necessary to capture detailed SR structure are impractical for whole-cell simulations.\\n\\nTo overcome this challenge, the 3-D network structure of the SR, rather than its full 3-D cross-sectional structure, was identified as the key feature to be captured in the model. Under this reduction, the SR can be approximated by a 3-D network of 1-D strands (Fig 3C). The resolution of this \\u201c1-D-strand model\\u201d was down-sampled to 350nm \\u00d7 350nm \\u00d7 350nm, and an algorithm applied to preserve each SR voxel\\u2019s nearest-neighbours (Fig 3C).\\n\\nThe volume of each node in the 1-D strand model corresponds to the total volume of the full resolution reconstructed SR divided by the number of nodes in the 1-D strand map, and is thus not defined by the volume of a single voxel at the discretised resolution (vvox.nsr = 0.00305 \\u03bcm3). For visualization of small portions of the cell model, the concentration distribution in the 1-D strand model was mapped back onto the full resolution reconstruction; this was impractical for visualization of the whole cell due to the computational memory demands of rendering such a large, high resolution structure.\\n\\nIn this section, a general spatio-temporal Ca2+ handling model is described in the context of an idealised cell structure. Then, approaches to incorporating the reconstructed SR and membrane structures are discussed. Full model equations can be found in S1 Text; in this section, only the fundamental equations are given.\\n\\nIn order to perform preliminary analysis to assess the role of intracellular structure affecting spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics, alternative geometries were considered for comparison to the fully detailed structural model: (1) Semi-idealised structure: The cytoplasm geometry was used to describe all of the spatially diffuse spaces and fluxes. Dyads were distributed evenly throughout the volume to match the mean inter-dyad distances in the structurally detailed model, resulting in comparable dyad densities (Ndyads for cross section = 2182 vs 2208 for the full and semi-idealised models, respectively). (2) Altered dyad densities: The density of the dyad distribution (and thus inter-dyad distances) in the fully detailed structural model was altered, by either including additional dyads (at junctions of the SR and TT) or by removing dyads. (3) Altered SR diffusion properties: The diffusion coefficient in the SR was varied (by a factor of half and a factor of two). Furthermore, the connectivity of the SR neighbour map was perturbed by removing some neighbours for a randomly selected set of the SR voxels.\\n\\nThe developed cell model reproduces properties of whole cell electrical and Ca2+ handling dynamics (Fig 6A) during control pacing (basic cycle length, BCL, of 1250ms). The AP duration to 90% repolarisation (APD90) at this cycle length is 345ms and the Ca2+ transient has an upstroke time of 20ms, magnitude of 0.68\\u03bcM and duration to 90% of peak of 400ms. These properties fall within expected ranges for large mammal ventricular myocytes (e.g. for the sheep\\u2013the animal model from which the structural datasets were attained [50,51]). The temporal evolution of force follows the Ca2+ transient (Fig 6Ae) which in turn follows the AP upstroke. Model dynamics are stable over long simulation duration times (Fig 6B) once steady-state is achieved. The model successfully reproduces rate dependence of the diastolic and systolic Ca2+ concentrations, exhibiting an elevation of both as pacing rate increases (S2 Fig).\\n\\nSpatio-temporal dynamics in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration associated with a single beat are shown in Fig 7 and S1 Video. The model captures the dynamics of a single Ca2+ spark (Fig 7A), illustrating the rapid and non-linear decay of the Ca2+ transient as a function of distance from the centre of the dyad [17,28]: the peak of the Ca2+ concentration at a distance of 1.2 \\u03bcm from the centre of the dyad was an order of magnitude smaller than at the dyad centre.\\n\\nA linescan along the longitudinal axis of the cell demonstrates the spatial variation in the rise and decay of the Ca2+ transient (Fig 7B): temporal variation of the initiation of the upstroke of the transient results in significant spatial gradients during the initial phase of excitation; significantly smoother spatial gradients were observed during the decay phase.\\n\\nSnapshots of spatial Ca2+ concentration in 3-D (Fig 7C) and with enhanced scaling (Fig 8A) reveal the 3-D structure of the Ca2+ gradients associated with normal excitation. Properties of Ca2+ gradients during the different phases of the transient are determined by intracellular structure and the nature of the various fluxes controlling Ca2+ dynamics.\\n\\nThe discrete and non-uniformly distributed dyads, heterogeneity in the dyadic cleft volume and small protein numbers (which enhances stochastic state transitions of the RyRs and LTCCs), combined with the rapid transient morphology of Jrel during excitation led to a rapid upstroke of the Ca2+ transient and significant spatial heterogeneity during this initial excitation phase (Fig 7Ci; Fig 8Ai). Jrel quickly terminates at around the time of the transient peak (S4 Fig)\\u2014the Ca2+ influx throughout the cell is significantly reduced and Ca2+ diffuses away from the dyads through the bulk cytoplasm, reducing the peaks surrounding the dyads and smoothing the gradients. Due to significant Ca2+ buffering, diffusion is slow and gradients are not eradicated (Fig 7Ciii; Fig 8Aii,iii). The decay of the Ca2+ transient is slower and more spatially uniform due to the spatially and temporally continuous nature of the effluxes, JMem and JSR, (Fig 7Civ; Fig 8Aiv). Subcellular heterogeneity was also observed during controlled AP clamp conditions.\\n\\nComparison to the semi-idealised cell model (which contains a uniform dyad distribution\\u2014See Methods: Semi-idealised and perturbed structure models) reveals that the complex 3-D structure of Ca2+ gradients is largely determined by the dyad distribution (compare Fig 8A with 8B). Temporal variation in the activation time of individual dyads results in significant gradients during the first few miliseconds of excitation in the semi-idealised model, but then much more uniform Ca2+ concentration was observed during the main excitation phase, compared to the fully detailed structural cell model (Fig 8). Inclusion of realistic flux distribution in the semi-idealised model enhances spatial heterogeneity but has a much smaller impact than the dyad distribution.\\n\\nSpatial Ca2+ gradients in the nSR were less pronounced than in the cytoplasm (Fig 9; S1 Video). Nevertheless, gradients were observed during the initial excitation (emptying) phase, due to the distributed dyads/jSRs (Fig 9i and 9ii). The spatial distribution is almost uniform at the time of maximum depletion of the SR (Fig 9iii). During the refilling phase (Fig 9iv), gradients were observed but are more uniform than those during the initial phase (compare Fig 9 panel iii with v), comparable to the behaviour observed in the bulk cytoplasm.\\n\\nFluxes acting on the cytoplasm in a single portion of the 3-D cell were analysed (Fig 10). The spatial distribution of Jup (Fig 10A) and JNaCa (Fig 10B) can be clearly seen, and correspond to the nSR and surface sarcolemma/TT structures, respectively. Spatial gradients in the magnitude of both of these fluxes are observed, as a direct result of the gradients in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (note the spatial correspondence between the gradients in Figs 7, 8 and 10).\\n\\nThe effect of voltage inhibition on the activity of JNaCa combined with the initial large peaks of Ca2+ in locations close to the dyads can be clearly seen by spatially distributed peaks in JNaCa in the initial phase of excitation (Fig 10Bi), uniform and small fluxes during the bulk of the excitation phase, wherein the Ca2+ concentration is large (Fig 10Bii), and a more spatially uniform but larger flux during the decay phase of the Ca2+ transient, corresponding to the peak of INaCa (Fig 10Biii).\\n\\nVarying the SR diffusion parameters primarily affected the spatial-distribution of Ca2+ in the SR: Rapid diffusion in the SR facilitated equilibration of the SR Ca2+ content and reduced gradients; slower diffusion enhanced Ca2+ gradients (Fig 17A). However, the impact on whole-cell dynamics was relatively minimal under the variance in diffusion coefficient of 0.5\\u20132 times the baseline value (0.3 \\u03bcm/ms) considered in this study.\\n\\nReduced connectivity in the SR network led to significant SR Ca2+ gradients during normal excitation, with islands of SR loading appearing during the systolic phase (Fig 17B). This localised early SR loading promoted secondary spontaneous release during the AP\\u2013note the locations of secondary release correspond to the islands of SR loading.\\n\\nIn this study, a model of 3-D spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics in a large mammal ventricular myocyte was developed which incorporates significant details of intracellular Ca2+ handling structures. This is the first to employ 3-D reconstructions of the TT network and SR for cardiac myocytes in situ within tissue blocks, derived from SBF-SEM (Fig 1). We describe how the structures were processed to form computational grids and mapping functions and incorporated into a 3-D spatio-temporal Ca2+ handling mathematical model, accounting for realistic cytoplasm and nSR structure and fluxes distributed according to the imaging data (Figs 2\\u20135). Our simulations illustrate that the model accurately reproduces excitation characteristics in normal conditions (Figs 6\\u20139) as well as perturbed conditions leading to Ca2+ transient alternans and spontaneous release events (Figs 11\\u201314), and reveals high resolution 3-D Ca2+ gradients and fluxes associated with excitation (Figs 8\\u201310). Furthermore, we provide preliminary analysis which demonstrates the importance of intracellular structures in determining the spatial distribution of dyad recruitment during Ca2+ transient alternans (Fig 13) and Ca2+ wave propagation (Fig 15) as well as the role of SR connectivity in maintaining stable Ca2+ dynamics (Fig 17).\\n\\nThere are numerous exemplary studies in recent years implementing spatio-temporal Ca2+ handling models in multiple dimensions (e.g. [17\\u201341]). These models have been used to mechanistically evaluate physiological and pathophysiological dynamics in the intracellular Ca2+ handling system, such as graded release [20], RyR dynamics [23,40], Ca2+ transient alternans [20,21,25,27,30], Ca2+ waves [19,20,41] and pacemaker activity [38], and account for varying degrees of detail of intracellular structure (realistic RyR distribution; reconstruction of single TT; super-resolution of single dyad). However, no model has yet accounted for the realistic structure of the nSR, nor integrated fluxes according to realistic membrane structure, dyad distribution and nSR structure at the whole cell scale.\\n\\nThe model developed in the present study achieves this goal, providing for the first time a framework to directly integrate imaging data on multiple structures with whole-cell modelling. A major feature of the model is the ability to account for the structure of the network SR at the whole-cell scale. Identifying the network-like structure of the model as the key feature to be captured provides a method to model Ca2+ diffusion throughout the nSR at lower resolutions than required to image this structure, through the reduction to a 3-D network of 1-D strands (Fig 3).\\n\\nWhereas idealised geometry based models offer ease of data interpretation and are suitable for general analysis of Ca2+ dynamics, the modelling approaches presented in this study provide a method to remove much of the uncertainty inherent to models based on idealised geometries and to directly asses how structure-function relationships are affected by variability in intracellular structure, which may be particularly relevant when considering structural remodelling associated with disease [7]. The present approach provides the first framework which allows multiple structural datasets to be directly integrated with mathematical modelling of Ca2+ dynamics without the assumptions required by idealised models to capture structural variability, which accentuate the inherent uncertainty of these models. This, therefore, potentially significantly increases the confidence of simulation data regarding variability in intracellular structure.\\n\\nOn the other hand, models of specific regions of the cell which incorporate realistic structure can offer significant understanding of local control of EC coupling, but cannot capture whole-cell emergent properties such as the interaction of heterogeneity of these structures throughout the cell. The model presented here therefore complements those previously developed, providing a framework to investigate whole-cell dynamics underlain by real structure and heterogeneity.\\n\\nWe note that, in support of the validation of the model, results in the present study are consistent with those of previous modelling studies where comparable. For example, Izu et al. 2006 [17] found similar results regarding the criticality of inter-dyad distances in maintaining the propagation of Ca2+ waves. Ca2+ spark hierarchy is similar to that shown in Nivala et al. 2012 [19]. The mechanism underlying Ca2+ transient alternans is consistent with the studies of Restrepo et al. 2008 [20], Rovetti et al. 2010 [21] and Alvarez-Lacalle et al. 2015 [25].\\n\\nThe suitability of the model for future research was demonstrated by its application under multiple conditions. The model reproduces whole-cell and spatio-temporal Ca2+ characteristics under control pacing (Figs 7\\u20139), rapid perturbed pacing leading to alternans (Figs 11\\u201313), and rapid pacing leading to SR overload, spontaneous Ca2+ release and the development of single-cell triggered activity (Figs 14\\u201316).\\n\\nThe primary focus of the study was to develop an approach to overcome the challenges inherent in the construction of such a detailed model and to demonstrate the suitability of the model for future research, which was achieved through application of the model in normal and arrhythmic excitation conditions. The intention of the model is for future studies to incorporate multiple datasets, including those describing multiple disease conditions, to fully assess the role of variability in intracellular structure in determining potentially pro-arrhythmic dynamics; such detailed analysis was therefore beyond the scope of this study.\\n\\nThis notwithstanding, the present study also provides for the first time detailed and high resolution (spatial, temporal and concentration) reconstruction of Ca2+ gradients and fluxes in 3-D in both the cytoplasm and network SR (see Results sections: Spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics in the bulk cytoplasm; Spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics in the network SR; Evaluation of spatial distribution of fluxes in the cytoplasm), as well as preliminary analysis of the importance of structure underlying spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics and the role of SR diffusion and connectivity (see Results sections: Intracellular Ca2+ transient alternans; Ca2+ spark hierarchy and spontaneous release events; SR Diffusion Properties).\\n\\nComparison with the semi-idealised model revealed similarities and differences between the two levels of detail included in the model. The similarities of whole-cell characteristics and gross spatio-temporal dynamics between the two models during normal structure highlights the suitability of idealised models for general and mechanistic modelling of spatio-temporal dynamics associated with normal structure.\\n\\nHowever, multiple results presented here also emphasise the important role of structure and heterogeneity underlying the complex and fine-scale details of 3-D intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, which may be particularly important for disease models of intracellular structural remodelling.\\n\\nFirst, the complex structure of 3-D Ca2+ gradients and intracellular Ca2+ fluxes arises primarily as result of dyad distribution and intracellular structure; this complex structure does not emerge in the idealised cell model. Moreover, spatially heterogeneous distributions of the membrane and SR Ca2+ fluxes were observed despite homogeneous distribution of the maximal flux rates, as a direct result of these intracellular Ca2+ gradients.\\n\\nSecond, the degree of disorder associated with alternans dynamics was significantly reduced in the structurally detailed model compared to the idealised model; dyad distribution significantly affects recruitment patterns and therefore spatially constrains the probabilistic nature of recruitment, with real structure reducing the phase variance associated with multiple small-amplitude cycles. Similarly, reduced density of dyad distribution led to significant failure to recruit and very small transients associated with the small amplitude cycle. These results thus add further insight to those gained in previous studies [20,25,27].\\n\\nThird, the critical inter-dyad distances to maintain Ca2+ propagation are within the distribution of dyad nearest neighbour distances; whereas the overall trend of Ca2+ spark hierarchy is preserved under different dyad distributions, the propagation patterns emerging and dependence on SR Ca2+ concentration were significantly affected by dyad distribution, with whole-cell coordinated single waves requiring relatively short inter-dyad distances.\\n\\nFinally, the connectivity of the network SR was vital in maintaining normal Ca2+ dynamics; reduced connectivity led to failure of the SR to equilibrate, significant and heterogeneous SR loading and secondary systolic Ca2+ release.\\n\\nThese results highlight the necessity for integrated multi-scale models which can capture realistic structure of both the intracellular and SR spaces as well as heterogeneity in dyad properties and flux distribution. For example, a combination of increased heterogeneity in dyad properties with remodelling of dyad distribution may result in highly unpredictable constraints on dynamics. TT structure, dyad distribution and SR structure have all been shown to be perturbed in both animal models of disease and patients [7\\u201314]. Whereas many previous modelling studies have investigated remodelling in proteins and flux dynamics in the single cell (e.g., [16]), intracellular structural remodelling has only been investigated by a few computational studies and these have been idealised (e.g., [52]). Application and analysis of structurally accurate models such as the one presented in this study will therefore allow mechanistic evaluation of the role of structural remodelling in determining arrhythmogenic electrical and perturbed contractile dynamics at the cellular scale as well as structure-function relationships underlying normal cardiac excitation.\\n\\nWhereas the present study includes a novel mathematical model describing intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, the primary focus was on the methods to process and integrate structural datasets into modelling frameworks. To demonstrate the generalisability of these approaches, the structural model was integrated with the independent mathematical model of Nivala et al. 2012 [27]. Note that this model contains a different schematic structure (with no subspace) and exhibits a larger Ca2+ transient associated with excitation.\\n\\nThe whole-cell characteristics of the integrated model were comparable to that of the Nivala et al. study, whereas the structure of intracellular Ca2+ gradients is comparable to those previously shown in the present study; Ca2+ diffusion is aided in the Nivala et al. version of the model as a result of the larger transient, and thus the quantitative comparison of the gradients reveals some differences\\u2013nevertheless, the main structure remains (S5 Fig). This therefore demonstrates the generalisability of the approaches for integration with independent mathematical models and further supports the suitability for future research.\\n\\nFor the purpose of the methodological development of the model, only a portion of the myocyte was reconstructed at high resolution and processed to form the computational grids and mapping functions used for simulation. For specific studies of variability in Ca2+ dynamics, especially those in disease where intracellular structure may be highly irregular, a larger or full-cell reconstruction would be necessary. However, it should be noted that this does not affect the fundamental model itself nor the methodological approaches for structural data processing.\\n\\nIn the model, the membrane and SR fluxes were spatially distributed according to maps created from the reconstructions. Within this structure, the fluxes were distributed evenly and continuously. Incorporation of immuno-labelling data describing the realistic distribution of the proteins responsible for these fluxes would provide a further degree of accuracy in the cell model as well as a tool for investigation of the functional impact of changes to the distribution of these flux-carrying proteins; arbitrary heterogeneity could have been introduced into the present model but this was avoided due to the inherent uncertainty in such an approach\\u2013the purpose of this model being to remove this necessity for future research. In further simulations, we also demonstrate that redistribution of INaCa primarily to the TTs, as has been performed in other studies [24], results in preferential flux in the TTs without significant perturbation to whole-cell dynamics (S6 Fig).\\n\\nThe model includes a restricted buffering subspace which functionally couples neighbouring dyads. The inclusion of this subspace was primarily motivated by considerations for reproducing physiological Ca2+ dynamics. Whereas the presence of pathways between the localised Ca2+ buffers may be physiologically relevant, it is not the intention of this study to make a comment and such functionality requires further investigation experimentally. We, however, note that similar constructs are present in previously developed models from other groups: in both Gaur-Rudy 2011 [28] and Voigt et al. 2014 [26], neighbouring dyadic spaces are directly coupled. The present model contains this functional coupling but also preserves the restricted local spaces of individual dyads. This construct is not critical to the primary novelty of the developed approach\\u2013in processing and modelling with the structural datasets\\u2013as demonstrated by integration with the independent mathematical model of Nivala et al., which does not contain this subspace (see Discussion: Generalisation of the model).\\n\\nThe dyads/jSRs were treated as point sources (single voxels) in the spatial geometries. Whereas heterogeneity was incorporated through functionality to vary dyadic cleft volume and protein numbers (NRyR and NLTCC), the spatial structure of the dyad, including local RyR distribution, is not accounted for in the present model. A multi-scale integration method could feasibly be implemented to integrate previously developed super-resolution models of single dyads [37,53], though this was beyond the scope of the present study. Similarly, the RyR dynamic model is primarily functional rather than rigorously based on experimental data describing RyR kinetics. Incorporation of a more accurate RyR model, such as the recent induction decay models [40] would also improve the accuracy and suitability for future studies. Furthermore, heterogeneity in the jSR volume and calsequestrin concentration could be included to further analyse the role of these heterogeneities underlying spatial Ca2+ dynamics.\\n\\nFurther possible extensions to the model include segmentation of the mitochondria [39] (the spatial distribution of the mitochondria will affect spatial Ca2+ diffusion because they effectively act as barrier to diffusion) and subsequent incorporation of localised energetics. Furthermore, the contractile system could also be segmented for simulation of spatially localised troponin buffering and force generation, for application to understand reduced contractile force associated with heart failure, for example.\\n\\nA computational model of 3-D spatio-temporal Ca2+ dynamics has been created which incorporates realistic reconstructions of multiple intracellular structures, namely the network SR structure, cytoplasm volume, and fluxes distributed according to the membrane/TT and SR structures. Understanding the role of intracellular Ca2+ cycling in physiological and pathophysiological cellular dynamics is vital for mechanistic evaluation of perturbed contraction and arrhythmia associated with Ca2+ handling malfunction, and may contribute to improved treatment strategies for prevention, management and termination of life-threatening conditions. The methodological framework and model reported here provide a powerful tool for future investigation of structure-function relationships at the whole cell scale underlying physiological and pathophysiological intracellular Ca2+ handling, beyond the insight gained in this study. Full model code is provided (S1 Code) to facilitate realisation of the potential of future applications of these approaches.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

We employ the natural infection of Drosophila with a parasitoid wasp to study energy regulation during immune response. To combat the invasion, the host must produce specialized immune cells (lamellocytes) that destroy the parasitoid egg. We show that a significant portion of nutrients are allocated to differentiating lamellocytes when they would otherwise be used for development. This systemic metabolic switch is mediated by extracellular adenosine released from immune cells. The switch is crucial for an effective immune response. Preventing adenosine transport from immune cells or blocking adenosine receptor precludes the metabolic switch and the deceleration of development, dramatically reducing host resistance. Adenosine thus serves as a signal that the \\u201cselfish\\u201d immune cells send during infection to secure more energy at the expense of other tissues.\\n\",\n          \"Genetic models of ribosome dysfunction show selective organ failure, highlighting a gap in our understanding of cell-type specific responses to translation insufficiency. Translation defects underlie a growing list of inherited and acquired cancer-predisposition syndromes referred to as ribosomopathies. We sought to identify molecular mechanisms underlying organ failure in a recessive ribosomopathy, with particular emphasis on the pancreas, an organ with a high and reiterative requirement for protein synthesis. Biallelic loss of function mutations in SBDS are associated with the ribosomopathy Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, which is typified by pancreatic dysfunction, bone marrow failure, skeletal abnormalities and neurological phenotypes. Targeted disruption of Sbds in the murine pancreas resulted in p53 stabilization early in the postnatal period, specifically in acinar cells. Decreased Myc expression was observed and atrophy of the adult SDS pancreas could be explained by the senescence of acinar cells, characterized by induction of Tgf\\u03b2, p15Ink4b and components of the senescence-associated secretory program. This is the first report of senescence, a tumour suppression mechanism, in association with SDS or in response to a ribosomopathy. Genetic ablation of p53 largely resolved digestive enzyme synthesis and acinar compartment hypoplasia, but resulted in decreased cell size, a hallmark of decreased translation capacity. Moreover, p53 ablation resulted in expression of acinar dedifferentiation markers and extensive apoptosis. Our findings indicate a protective role for p53 and senescence in response to Sbds ablation in the pancreas. In contrast to the pancreas, the Tgf\\u03b2 molecular signature was not detected in fetal bone marrow, liver or brain of mouse models with constitutive Sbds ablation. Nevertheless, as observed with the adult pancreas phenotype, disease phenotypes of embryonic tissues, including marked neuronal cell death due to apoptosis, were determined to be p53-dependent. Our findings therefore point to cell/tissue-specific responses to p53-activation that include distinction between apoptosis and senescence pathways, in the context of translation disruption.\\n\",\n          \"Intracellular calcium cycling is a vital component of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The key structures responsible for controlling calcium dynamics are the cell membrane (comprising the surface sarcolemma and transverse-tubules), the intracellular calcium store (the sarcoplasmic reticulum), and the co-localisation of these two structures to form dyads within which calcium-induced-calcium-release occurs. The organisation of these structures tightly controls intracellular calcium dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of intracellular calcium cycling in three-dimensions (3-D), which incorporates high resolution reconstructions of these key regulatory structures, attained through imaging of tissue taken from the sheep left ventricle using serial block face scanning electron microscopy. An approach was developed to model the sarcoplasmic reticulum structure at the whole-cell scale, by reducing its full 3-D structure to a 3-D network of one-dimensional strands. The model reproduces intracellular calcium dynamics during control pacing and reveals the high-resolution 3-D spatial structure of calcium gradients and intracellular fluxes in both the cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrated the capability of the model to reproduce potentially pro-arrhythmic dynamics under perturbed conditions, pertaining to calcium-transient alternans and spontaneous release events. Comparison with idealised cell models emphasised the importance of structure in determining calcium gradients and controlling the spatial dynamics associated with calcium-transient alternans, wherein the probabilistic nature of dyad activation and recruitment was constrained. The model was further used to highlight the criticality in calcium spark propagation in relation to inter-dyad distances. The model presented provides a powerful tool for future investigation of structure-function relationships underlying physiological and pathophysiological intracellular calcium handling phenomena at the whole-cell. The approach allows for the first time direct integration of high-resolution images of 3-D intracellular structures with models of calcium cycling, presenting the possibility to directly assess the functional impact of structural remodelling at the cellular scale.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"plain language summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The immune response is energetically costly and often requires adaption of the whole organism to ensure it receives enough energy. It is not well understood how distribution of energy resources within the organism is regulated during an immune response. To understand this better, we used parasitoid wasp infection of fruit fly larvae\\u2014the host larvae have 48 h before they pupate to destroy the infecting \\u201calien\\u201d or face destruction by the parasitoid that will consume the developing pupa. Here we find a signal, generated by the host immune cells, which mediates a systemic energy switch. This signal\\u2014adenosine\\u2014suppresses processes driving larval to pupal development of the host, thereby freeing up energy for the immune system. We show that the resulting developmental delay in the fruit fly larvae is crucial for an efficient immune response; without the adenosine signal, resistance to the parasitoid drops drastically. Generation of this signal by immune cells demonstrates that in response to external stressors, the immune system can mobilize reallocation to itself of energy and nutrients from the rest of the organism.\\n\",\n          \"Growth of all living things relies on protein synthesis. Failure of components of the complex protein synthesis machinery underlies a growing list of inherited and acquired multi\\u2014organ syndromes referred to as ribosomopathies. While ribosomes, the critical working components of the protein synthesis machinery, are required in all cell types to translate the genetic code, only certain organs manifest clinical symptoms in ribosomopathies, indicating specific cell-type features of protein synthesis control. Further, many of these diseases result in cancer despite an inherent deficit in growth. Here we report a range of consequences of protein synthesis insufficiency with loss of a broadly expressed ribosome factor, leading to growth impairment and cell cycle arrest at different stages. Apparent induction of p53-dependent cell death and arrest pathways included apoptosis in the fetal brain and senescence in the mature exocrine pancreas. The senescence, considered a tumour suppression mechanism, was accompanied by the expression of biomarkers associated with early stages of malignant transformation. These findings inform how cancer may initiate when growth is compromised and provide new insights into cell-type specific consequences of protein synthesis insufficiency.\\n\",\n          \"The organisation of the membrane and sub-cellular structures of cells in the heart closely controls the coupling between its electrical and mechanical function. Computational models of the cellular calcium handling system, which is responsible for this electro-mechanical coupling, have been developed in recent years to study underlying structure-function relationships. Previous models have been largely idealised in structure; we present a new model which incorporates experimental data describing the high-resolution organisation of the primary structures involved in calcium dynamics. Significantly, the structure of the intracellular calcium store is modelled for the first time. The model is shown to reproduce calcium dynamics in control cells in both normal and abnormal conditions, demonstrating its suitability for future investigation of structure-function relationships. Thus, the model presented provides a powerful tool for the direct integration of experimentally acquired structural data in healthy and diseased cells and assessment of the role of structure in regulating normal and abnormal calcium dynamics.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

Gaining a deeper understanding of host pathways exploited by henipaviruses for infection may identify targets for new anti-viral therapies. Here we have performed genome-wide high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection. miR-181 also promoted Nipah virus infection, but did not affect infection by paramyxoviruses from other genera, indicating specificity in the virus-host interaction. Infection promotion was primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to significantly enhance henipavirus-induced membrane fusion. Cell signalling receptors of ephrins, namely EphA5 and EphA7, were identified as novel negative regulators of henipavirus fusion. The expression of these receptors, as well as EphB4, were suppressed by miR-181 overexpression, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of several Ephs by the miRNA contributes to enhanced infection and fusion. Immune-responsive miR-181 levels was also up-regulated in the biofluids of ferrets and horses infected with Hendra virus, suggesting that the host innate immune response may promote henipavirus spread and exacerbate disease severity. This study is the first genome-wide screen of miRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus and nominates select miRNAs as targets for future anti-viral therapy development.\\n\",\n          \"A number of different genetics-based vector control methods have been proposed. Two approaches currently under development in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the two-locus engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drive systems. Each of these is theoretically capable of increasing in frequency within a population, thus spreading associated desirable genetic traits. Thus they have gained attention for their potential to aid in the fight against various mosquito-vectored diseases. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. it is self-sustaining) whilst in the killer-rescue system the rescue component should initially increase in frequency (while the lethal component (killer) is common) before eventually declining (when the killer is rare) and being eliminated (i.e. it is temporally self-limiting). The population genetics of both systems have been explored using discrete generation mathematical models. The effects of various ecological factors on these two systems have also been considered using alternative modelling methodologies. Here we formulate and analyse new mathematical models combining the population dynamics and population genetics of these two classes of gene drive that incorporate ecological factors not previously studied and are simple enough to allow the effects of each to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on the potential effects that may be obtained as a result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; and the relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also extend our models to consider population dynamics in two demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal between neighbouring populations on the outcome of UD and KR gene drive systems.\\n\",\n          \"Exogenous Interleukin-7 (IL-7), in supplement to antiretroviral therapy, leads to a substantial increase of all CD4+ T cell subsets in HIV-1 infected patients. However, the quantitative contribution of the several potential mechanisms of action of IL-7 is unknown. We have performed a mathematical analysis of repeated measurements of total and naive CD4+ T cells and their Ki67 expression from HIV-1 infected patients involved in three phase I/II studies (N\\u200a=\\u200a53 patients). We show that, besides a transient increase of peripheral proliferation, IL-7 exerts additional effects that play a significant role in CD4+ T cell dynamics up to 52 weeks. A decrease of the loss rate of the total CD4+ T cell is the most probable explanation. If this effect could be maintained during repeated administration of IL-7, our simulation study shows that such a strategy may allow maintaining CD4+ T cell counts above 500 cells/\\u00b5L with 4 cycles or fewer over a period of two years. This in-depth analysis of clinical data revealed the potential for IL-7 to achieve sustained CD4+ T cell restoration with limited IL-7 exposure in HIV-1 infected patients with immune failure despite antiretroviral therapy.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"plain language summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The henipaviruses Hendra and Nipah are bat-borne paramyxoviruses that are highly pathogenic in humans. Until recently the constraints of working at biosafety level 4 had hindered the large scale study of host factors associated with henipavirus infection. MicroRNAs are a class of single-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate biological processes in eukaryotes. An emerging body of evidence suggests that host microRNAs may favour infection of vertebrate RNA viruses. We have performed high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection and appear to suppress multiple antiviral host molecules. Infection promotion is primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to repress Eph receptors that negatively regulate henipavirus glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion. This study is the first large-scale screen of host-encoded microRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus, and of a BSL-4 virus, and supports the emerging notion that host miRNAs can play a role in supporting infection of RNA viruses.\\n\",\n          \"Vector-borne diseases represent a severe burden to both human and animal health worldwide. The methods currently being used to control a range of these diseases do not appear sufficient to address the issues at hand. As such, alternate methods for the control of vector-borne diseases are currently being investigated. Among the promising techniques currently being considered are a range of genetic control methods known as gene drive systems. These allow desirable genetic traits (such as a much reduced capacity for vectors to transmit viruses) to be spread through a target population; taking advantage of natural mate seeking behaviour to locate vector sub-populations that can be extremely difficult for humans to locate and reach. Here we use mathematical models (parameterised to consider mosquito populations) to demonstrate the robustness of the engineered underdominance and killer-rescue classes of gene drive to different ecological factors including birth and death rates; the number and quality of breeding sites (i.e. carrying capacity); and the strength of density-dependent competition during the larval development phase. We then go on to explore the range of potential outcomes that may result from the migration of individuals between two neighbouring populations.\\n\",\n          \"HIV infection is characterized by a decrease of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the blood. Whereas antiretroviral treatment succeeds to control viral replication, some patients fail to reconstitute their CD4+ T cell count to normal value. IL-7 is a promising cytokine under evaluation for its use in HIV infection, in supplement to antiretroviral therapy, as it increases cell proliferation and survival. Here, we use data from three clinical trials testing the effect of IL-7 on CD4+ T-cell recovery in treated HIV-infected individuals and use a simple mathematical model to quantify IL-7 effects by estimating the biological parameters of the model. We show that the increase of peripheral proliferation could not explain alone the long-term dynamics of T cells after IL-7 injections underlining other important effects such as the improvement of cell survival. We also investigate the feasibility and the efficiency of repetitions of IL-7 cycles and argue for further evaluation through clinical trials.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxoviruses belonging to the genus Henipavirus [1]. First isolated in Australia in 1994, HeV disease has caused seven clinically confirmed human cases with four fatalities. NiV initially appeared in Malaysia in 1998\\u20131999, resulting in 105 human fatalities. Since 2001, recurring outbreaks of NiV have been reported in South Asia, resulting in more than 211 deaths and an average case-fatality rate of approximately 75% [2, 3]. Both bat-borne henipaviruses cause severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans, however there is a lack of therapies and vaccines. With high fatality rates emphasising the need for effective anti-viral strategies [4\\u20136], a better understanding of henipavirus biology is required.\\n\\nViruses may co-opt or alter a range of host cell processes that optimise replicative efficiency. One such process is the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway [7]. Conventionally, in chordates RNAi involves the base-pairing of small non-coding microRNA (miRNA) molecules in a multi-protein complex to complementary mRNA sequences, often resulting in post-transcriptional silencing of host gene expression [8]. Some DNA viruses (i.e. herpesviruses) in particular, which also encode their own viral miRNAs, are known to subvert this fundamental host process to promote infection [7]. For RNA viruses however, the pro-viral roles of host miRNAs remain poorly characterized. Up until recently, the general thought was that the multifaceted dependence of hepatitis C virus infection on hepatocyte-specific miR-122 is the exception, not the rule, for RNA viruses [9, 10].\\n\\nMore recently, a few high profile studies have highlighted that the usurping of host miRNAs by RNA viruses might previously have been underappreciated. Trobaugh et al. showed that the alphavirus Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) utilizes host-derived miR-142-3p to define cell tropism and to suppress innate immunity, indirectly promoting neuropathogenesis [11]. A comprehensive survey of 15 RNA viruses from 7 families identified miR-17 and let-7 binding to pestivirus 3\\u2019 UTR as critical for enhanced viral translation, RNA stability and virus production [12]. The Argonaute protein, a key component of functional miRNA complexes, was also found to be associated with viral RNA of virtually all of the viruses assessed, including paramyxoviruses [12]. These Argonaute-viral RNA interactions also often exhibit preferential clustering on the viral subgenomes, implying specificities in the miRNA targeting. Enterovirus infection induces host miR-141 expression, which is then co-opted by the virus to silence cellular translation initiation factor eIF4E, resulting in host translational shutoff [13]. One emerging concept from such studies is the sequestration or \\u201csponging\\u201d of anti-viral host miRNAs by genomes of some RNA viruses to derepress cellular transcripts that might enhance infection [9, 12]. These reports suggest that RNA viruses can adopt host miRNAs for their own utility via a diversity of mechanisms, and that this aspect of virus-host interactions is currently understudied.\\n\\nWith technological advancements in high-throughput techniques making the comprehensive study of both physical and genetic virus-host interactions a possibility [5], we have started executing functional genomics screens using fully infectious biosafety level 4 agents [14]. Despite the power of functional genomics as a research tool, thus far only two comprehensive RNAi screens investigating the contributions of miRNAs to pathogenesis of RNA viruses have been reported [15, 16]. No such study has been done for BSL-4 viruses and for any of the medically relevant mononegaviruses, such as paramyxoviruses or filoviruses. In light of recent studies underscoring the potential significance of miRNAs for RNA virus replication as well as the therapeutic promise of miRNA antagonists [6, 17], we sought to address this gap in our knowledge of virus-host interplay.\\n\\nHere we present findings from two high-throughput genome-wide screens, conducted at BSL-4, of host-encoded miRNAs associated with HeV infection. The screens, in addition to subsequent validation work, demonstrate a key role for miR-181 family members in regulating henipavirus syncytia formation and infection, and suggest several host miRNAs, including miR-17~93, as potential candidates for novel therapeutic targets.\\n\\nTo identify host-encoded miRNAs that regulate HeV infection, we performed two complementary high-throughput screens at BSL-4 that targeted 834 human host-encoded miRNAs (Fig 1A). This first involved the reverse transfection of HeLa cells with a library of 1,239 synthetic miRNA agonists (i.e. mimics), which are double-stranded RNA molecules that functionally imitate native miRNAs, to over-express each of 834 miRNAs in a 384-well plate format. In a concurrent screen silencing each of the 834 miRNAs, HeLa cells were transfected with a library consisting of 1,225 antagonists (i.e. inhibitors), which are single-stranded RNA molecules that bind and sequester native mature miRNAs [18]. After library preparation and transfection were performed under BSL-2 conditions, one set of the daughter plates for each screen was moved to BSL-4 (red box, Fig 1A). 72 h after transfection, these cells were infected with a recombinant HeV that expresses the firefly luciferase reporter gene [19]. After 24 h, a luminometer was used to measure luciferase expression of the infected cells for both screens at BSL-4. The impact that each miRNA agonist or antagonist had on reporter expression was normalized to values from mock-transfected cells, and then expressed in terms of a robust Z-score, which is a commonly used measure of hit identification for RNAi screens [20, 21]. Z-scores of 2 or greater indicate an increase in infection relative to control, whereas Z-scores of -2 or lower indicate a decrease in infection.\\n\\nThe other set of daughter plates with transfected cells were processed for cell viability analysis by nuclei quantification using an automated fluorescence microscope (Fig 1A). Cells that were transfected with a siRNA targeting the PLK1 gene served as a positive control for cell death. 54 of the agonists and none of the antagonists caused significant cell death relative to mock-transfected cells (\\u226570% cut-off) and were thus subsequently eliminated from the robust Z-score analysis and final hit list generation (S1 Table and S2 Table).\\n\\nThe agonist and antagonist screens identified 35 and 61 miRNAs respectively that significantly promoted HeV infection, and 19 and 83 miRNAs respectively, that significantly inhibited virus infection (Fig 1B and 1C, S1 Table and S2 Table). Eight miRNAs exhibited pro-viral characteristics in both agonist and antagonist screens (Fig 1D), including all four members of the miR-181 family. Conversely, both screens identified miR-532 as a miRNA that inhibits infection. In regards to miRNAs that promote virus infection, screen results from two miRNA families were notable. All four members of the miR-181 family significantly promoted HeV infection (Fig 2A). These miRNAs all share the same seed sequence (ACAUUC), implying significant congruency in function(s). The scale of the pro-viral impacts of miR-181 members is especially remarkable if we compare their effects to that of miR-146a (Fig 2A), which we previously validated as pro-viral for HeV [22]. In addition to miR-181, most members of the miR-17~93 family were pro-viral (Fig 2B). The seed sequence of the miRNAs in this family (AAAGUG) is distinct from that of miR-181.\\n\\nMiRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences typically located in the 3\\u2019 untranslated region (3\\u2019 UTR) of the mRNA target [23\\u201326]. Depending on the degree of complementarity, this generally results in the suppression or degradation of target mRNA, thereby preventing encoded proteins from being translated [23, 25, 26]. As each miRNA can act as a suppressor of many target genes, we hypothesized that miR-181 and miR-17~93 families promoted henipavirus infection by suppressing multiple anti-viral host genes. To test this hypothesis, we firstly mined the miRTarbase database [27] to identify all experimentally-validated target genes for miR-181 and miR17~93 families. Next, the effects of these genes on HeV infection, as represented in robust Z-scores, were cross-referenced from results of our published genome-wide siRNA screen that identified pro- and anti-viral host genes for henipaviruses [14] (S3 Table). This analysis demonstrates that for both miRNA families these genes were more likely to be anti-viral (Fig 2C and 2D). For instance, the ratio of anti-viral to pro-viral hits for validated miR-181 targets was 2.2 to 1 (Fig 2C). In contrast, this ratio for all unbiased gene hits in the entire screen was 1 to 1 [14]. Collectively, these data suggest that the net outcome of miR-181 or miR17~93 expression is a cellular microenvironment that is more conducive for henipavirus infection. The results also indicate a reasonable level of congruency between our miRNA and siRNA gene screen datasets.\\n\\nWe also sought to determine whether miR-181 preferentially regulates the expression of host proteins localized in a particular subcellular compartment. To this end, the list of experimentally-validated miR-181 targets (n = 78 genes) was obtained from miRTarBase was subjected to annotation enrichment analysis using the DAVID web service. Functional annotation clustering analysis was performed using default settings (Fisher\\u2019s exact test to calculate p-values, followed by multiple testing correction using the Benjamini method). This analysis demonstrated an enrichment of miR-181 target genes associated with the nucleoplasm (p = 4.6e-5), while proteins associated with plasma membrane localization were not significantly enriched (p = 0.7).\\n\\nAll four members of the miR-181 family exhibited consistent pro-viral phenotypes in both the agonist and antagonist screens (Figs 1D and 2A). We thus decided to investigate the role of this miRNA family in henipavirus infection further. Firstly, since the screens were performed using a recombinant reporter HeV, we validated the observations using a wild-type virus. Screen results suggested that miR-181d is one of the most pro-viral members of the family (Fig 2A, S1 Table and S2 Table), hence miR-181d was chosen as a representative member of the miR-181 family in the majority of subsequent experiments.\\n\\nHeLa cells were transfected with miR-181d-specific agonists to effectively over-express miR-181d. Non-targeting miRNA agonists (miNEG), or transfection reagent devoid of agonist (mock), were also included as negative controls. At 72 h post-transfection, cells were infected with wild-type HeV and incubated for 24 h. The cell supernatants were then collected and applied to a TCID50 assay to quantify infectious virus titre. As indicated in Fig 3A, the results showed a 350% increase in HeV infectious titres in cells transfected with miR-181d agonists compared to control miRNA agonists.\\n\\nIn addition to TCID50 measurements of HeV titres in cell supernatants, the impact of miR-181d agonists on the proportion of infected cells and HeV protein production was investigated using quantitative immunofluorescence imaging. Transfected cells were infected with HeV for 24 h, before being fixed and stained with fluorescently labelled antibodies. The HeV phosphoprotein (P) was selected for analysis due to its high protein expression levels during infection [28, 29]. Compared with control miRNA agonists, cells transfected with miR-181d agonists showed a significant increase in both the percentage of cells infected (>50% increase) (Fig 3B) and also the levels of virus antigen per infected cell (>25% increase) (Fig 3C). In support of the quantitative data, both an increase in HeV P protein concentration and also syncytia formation (characteristic of paramyxovirus infection) could be visually observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig 3D).\\n\\nTo assess whether the pro-viral effects of miR-181 are specific to HeV, the in vitro activity of miR-181d agonists were tested on a range of viruses from different subfamilies of the Paramyxoviridae family. These included the closely related Nipah virus (subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Henipavirus), but also measles virus (subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Morbillivirus), mumps virus (subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Rubulavirus) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, subfamily Pneumovirinae, genus Pneumovirus). Influenza A/WSN/33(H1N1), an orthomyxovirus, was also included to compare with a virus from a different family. TCID50 measurements of the supernatants collected from transfected cells infected with NiV revealed a significant >300% increase in virus production in cells treated with miR-181d agonists compared to control miRNA agonists (Fig 4). On the other hand, infectivity assays showed no significant differences in virus titre between cells transfected with miR-181d or control agonists and infected with either measles virus, mumps virus, RSV or influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1). These results indicate that the enhancement effects of miR-181 are specific to the henipavirus genus.\\n\\nIn order to narrow down the possible mechanisms by which miR-181 promotes henipavirus infection, we next sought to delineate the part of the virus life cycle at which miR-181 promotes infection. We first looked at whether viral RNA synthesis was induced by miR-181 during a single round of HeV infection. Cells were transfected with miR-181 agonists, and then infected with a high MOI (5) of HeV. At 0, 12 and 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.), cell lysates were harvested, and intracellular viral RNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Our previous studies have shown that in HeLa cells the first cycle of HeV infection is completed by 24 h but not at 12 h [14]. Nonetheless, here cell supernatants were also collected and virus titres from all time-points were determined by TCID50 assay (S1 Fig). Congruent to our previous observations, production of progeny virions was only detected at 24 h.p.i.\\n\\nAt 12 h.p.i., a four-log10 increase in viral RNA above inocula levels was observed in cells transfected with either miNEG or siNEG (Fig 5A). This increase could be suppressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the entry receptor for HeV, ephrin-B2. In contrast, pre-treatment of cells with miR-181d agonists increased the amount of HeV RNA by approximately 3-fold relative to cells treated with control agonist. Thus, miR-181 promotes henipavirus infection at, or prior to, the step of viral RNA synthesis. Similar trends in viral RNA levels amongst the treatment groups were also observed at 24 h.p.i.\\n\\nChanges in viral RNA synthesis as measured by qRT-PCR during a single cycle infection could be due to effects on viral entry, genome replication, viral transcription or translation. To address whether miR-181 promotes entry of henipaviruses, a cell-cell fusion assay was performed using 293T effector cells expressing HeV F and G-glycoproteins [14]. Target cells (HeLa) were pre-transfected with either miR-181d agonist or the control agonist (miNEG), stained with a live cell membrane dye, and co-cultured for 24 h with effector cells expressing both glycoproteins or HeV G alone. Syncytia formation was imaged after fixation of the co-cultures and immunofluorescent staining for surface G glycoproteins. As controls, target cells were pre-treated with either siRNA duplexes targeting ephrin-B2 (positive control for impaired cell entry) or siNEG.\\n\\nAs expected, cells transfected with either siNEG or miNEG formed many multinucleated cells with the effector cells (Fig 5B). In contrast, cells with depleted ephrin-B2 either did not fuse with the effector cells, or fused into smaller syncytia with less nuclei. Additionally, effector cells expressing G singly did not develop syncytia with any of the target cells. Interestingly, miR-181-transfected cells induced substantially more, and larger, syncytia. Cell-cell fusion was so extensive, in a few instances polykaryons with at least 100 nuclei were observed. The extent of fusion for each treatment group was measured using automated image analysis. Results corroborate what was observed by visual inspection, indicating that miR-181 overexpression induced a drastic 9- to 10-fold increase in fusion events relative to control (Fig 5C). Conversely, ephrin-B2 knockdown caused about a 90% reduction in syncytia formation.\\n\\nConsidering the striking pro-fusogenic activity of miR-181, we wondered whether this effect is unique to the miR-181 family of miRNAs. The miR-17~93 family was another high-ranking pro-viral hit from the dual miRNA screens (Figs 1D and 2B). We decided to test the impact of miRNAs from this family on henipavirus-induced cell-cell fusion.\\n\\nWe first sought to validate the pro-viral effects of the miR-17~93 family using wild-type HeV. Agonists for two representative members of the miR-17~93 family, miR-17 and miR-93, were transfected into HeLa cells, and the permissiveness of these cells to HeV infection was evaluated using quantitative immunofluorescent analysis. The proportion of infected cells was 2-fold higher in the cells treated with miR-17 agonists compared to cells treated with control agonists (Fig 6A). This was commensurate with the uptick in infection ratio in the miR-93-treated cells (170% relative to control). Virus yields in the supernatants of miR-17 agonist-treated cells were also enhanced, as measured by TCID50 assays (Fig 6B). For comparison, the activity of these agonists on another paramyxovirus, RSV, was also analysed using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig 6A). Akin to the impact of miR-17~93 on HeV infection, we found that the ratios of infected cells were also significantly higher in the miR-17 and miR-93 agonist transfected cells (189% and 180% of control, respectively). These results further validate the datasets from the complementary screens (Fig 1), and indicate that members of the miR-17~93 family are indeed promotive for wild-type henipavirus infection. However, and rather intriguingly, unlike miR-181 (Fig 4), members of the miR-17~93 family appear to also exhibit pro-viral effects on a paramyxovirus from a different subfamily than the henipaviruses.\\n\\nOnce the pro-viral ability of miR-17 was established, we then performed the cell-cell fusion assay to assess the fusogenic effects of miR-17 agonists. Consistent with our previous observations (Fig 5B), target cells depleted of ephrin-B2 exhibited muted fusion activity relative to control cells (Fig 6C). In contrast, target cells treated with miR-181d agonists formed larger multinucleated cells. Interestingly, even though miR-17 enhanced HeV infection, cells loaded with miR-17 agonists did not fuse at significantly higher efficiencies than negative control cells. Of note, smaller syncytia were formed in this experiment as less target cells were added to the co-cultures. The extent of syncytia formation in the captured images of all microscopy fields were additionally quantified using automated image analysis software (Fig 6D).\\n\\nIn sum, these results indicate that HeV-glycoprotein mediated cell-cell fusion is greatly stimulated by miR-181, but not by miR-17, suggesting that miR-181 specifically facilitates henipavirus infection by enhancing host entry and, quite possibly, by supporting cell-to-cell spread during late stages of infection via syncytia formation.\\n\\nSince miR-181 specifically promotes infection of henipaviruses but not other paramyxoviruses, it is quite likely miR-181 increases membrane fusion by directly targeting viral and/or host molecules unique to the henipavirus fusion machinery. Although most miRNAs reduce expression of its target mRNA, there have been instances where miRNA binding improves stability and translation of the mRNA [30, 31]. Thus, we next investigated if miR-181 overexpression would enhance expression of the virus entry receptors ephrin-B2 and -B3, as well as the viral fusion glycoproteins F and G. miR-181a agonists were included in this analysis, subsequent to the validation of their pro-fusion nature in infection and fusion assays (S2 Fig). Perhaps surprisingly, S3 Fig shows that expression levels of the host and viral molecules which are known to be directly involved in fusion were not appreciably boosted by miR-181d. Similar results were observed for miR-181a as well. In fact, miR-181 downregulated ephrin-B3 and and HeV F glycoprotein by about 30 to 40%.\\n\\nGiven the substantial impact of miR-181 on cell-cell fusion (Fig 5B and 5C), it was intriguing that the miRNA did not considerably enhance expression levels of host and viral molecules known to be involved in entry and fusion. This led us to hypothesize that miR-181 supported fusion by down-regulating the expression of one or more novel cellular factor(s) that antagonizes expression and/or activity of the henipavirus entry receptors, ephrin-B2 or\\u2013B3. In the host, ephrins serve as native ligands for cellular Eph receptors (Ephs), which are high-affinity cell surface receptors belonging to the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Ephs and ephrins are further subdivided into classes A and B. Co-crystal structures of ephrin-B2 in complex either with its natural Eph [32, 33] or with the henipavirus G glycoproteins [34] have been solved. Intriguingly, these structures reveal the GH binding loop of ephrin-B2 to be the same dynamic region predominantly responsible for mediating the binding of ephrin-B2 to its natural Eph receptors as well as to the viral attachment proteins (S4A Fig.) [35]. Because the affinities of ephrin-B2-HeV-G and known ephrin-B2-Eph receptor interactions are within comparable nanomolar range [34, 36, 37], it implies that the Ephs may compete with the viral glycoprotein for binding to ephrin-B2. If true, one would expect Ephs to exhibit anti-viral properties, and any miRNAs which target these receptors for knockdown would be pro-viral.\\n\\nIndeed, Bossart et al. previously reported that soluble forms of Ephs (EphB3 and B4) can compete with henipavirus G proteins for binding to ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, and can also inhibit virus infection [38]. Additionally, analysis of data from our recently published genome-wide siRNA screen [14] reveal that Ephs are more likely to be inhibitors of HeV infection (S4B Fig and S4 Table). That said, algorithmic analysis by TargetScan [39, 40] of all human Ephs does not predict miR-181 binding sites in the 3\\u2019 UTR of the mRNAs of EphB3 or EphB4 (S4 Table). Of the three Ephs which have putative binding sites, all belong to class A receptors. This includes the EphA5 receptor, which is the most anti-viral Eph receptor in our published RNAi screen (S4B Fig). Even though ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 tend to preferentially engage with class B Eph receptors (e.g. EphB3 and B4), there is some precedence for crosstalk interaction with class A Eph receptors as well, such as EphA4 [41] and EphA3 [42] (S4A Fig). Thus, a potential model for the pro-viral mechanism of miR-181 posits that the miRNA down-regulates expression of Ephs, increasing the pool of unbound ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 for henipavirus G glycoproteins to attach and trigger entry/membrane fusion.\\n\\nTo test this model, we began by assessing the impact of silencing select Ephs on HeV infection. We opted to assess all Ephs with putative miR-181 target sites as predicted by TargetScan [39, 40], namely EphA4, A5 and A7 (S4 Table). Even though it was not predicted to contain any miR-181 binding sites, EphB4 was the most anti-viral hit of the class B receptors in the RNAi screen and was previously shown to compete with HeV G glycoprotein for ephrin-B2 binding [38], so it was incorporated into our study as well.\\n\\nWe first validated the siRNAs used to silence expression of the particular Ephs. Transfecting HeLa cells with siRNAs targeting EphA4, A5, A7 or B4 resulted in a >80% relative decrease in target mRNA expression (Fig 7A). Down-regulating EphA4, A5, A7 or B4 with these siRNA duplexes all caused significant increases in HeV infection (Fig 7B), with EphB4 exhibiting the greatest impact (~200% of siNEG). We next performed a cell-cell fusion assay to directly test the effects of silencing of these receptors on henipavirus fusion. Interestingly, even though EphA4 was inhibitory for virus infection, it did not seem to be repress syncytia formation (Fig 7C), suggesting that EphA4 blocks infection at a step post entry. On the other hand, EphA5, A7 and B4 all suppressed cell fusion, with relative trends comparable to that seen in the infection assay (Fig 7B). We therefore demonstrate, for the first time, that in addition to class B receptors (i.e. EphB3 and B4), class A Eph receptors can also inhibit henipavirus cell-cell fusion.\\n\\nTo evaluate whether these anti-fusion Ephs are suppression targets of miR-181, the mRNA levels of the Ephs in agonist-transfected cells were measured by qRT-PCR. Over-expressing miR-181a and miR-181d caused a significant reduction in EphA5 and A7 mRNA levels, with the latter showing the greatest reduction in gene expression (Fig 7D). In contrast, EphA4 levels were not impacted by miR-181d, and were only modestly (11%) affected by miR-181a, demonstrating some level of specificity in the regulation of Eph receptor expression by miR-181. Interestingly, although it was not computationally predicted to have any target site in its mRNA 3\\u2019 UTR, EphB4 levels were reduced by both miRNAs by about 40% (Fig 7D). These data show that endogenous levels of the henipavirus fusion regulators EphA5, A7 and B4 can all be significantly suppressed by miR-181 expression. Simultaneous suppression of all three negative fusion regulators would conceivably result in a cellular state with abundant unbound ephrin molecules, strongly favoring efficient activation of the viral fusion machinery. This provides a coherent mechanistic model for how miR-181 may expedite host entry and virus spread during infection.\\n\\nPrevious studies have reported that members of the miR-181 family are involved in different aspects of immune regulation [43\\u201345]. In particular, miR-181a expression levels have been shown to correlate with pro-inflammatory signals (e.g. IL-1\\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\\u03b1) in blood tissues of humans with chronic inflammation, as well as blood of LPS-treated mice [46]. Additionally, miR-181 expression in human kidney tissues were found to be associated with increased transcription of genes of inflammation pathways [47]. As the biological relevance of miRNAs is linked to their prevalence [48], we considered examining changes in levels of miR-181 molecules in in vivo infection models for henipaviruses. We hypothesized that, in conjunction with the host pro-inflammatory response during early infection, miR-181 expression might be up-regulated in HeV-infected mammals, but perhaps the virus co-opts this up-regulation to support infection and viral spread in the host.\\n\\nFerrets have been established as an animal model for the study of several human respiratory viruses [49], including Hendra and Nipah viruses [50, 51]. Accordingly, sixteen adult ferrets were exposed to HeV via the oronasal route, monitored for clinical signs and play activity, and two or four ferrets were euthanized at 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 day post-exposure (d.p.e.). After an incubation period of about five days, some ferrets started exhibiting weight loss, which correlated with an increase in rectal temperatures (S5A Fig and S5B Fig). By seven d.p.e., visible clinical signs, including depression, lack of grooming, or a decrease in playfulness, were observed in three out of four remaining ferrets. Establishment of HeV infection was confirmed by performing qRT-PCR for HeV genomic RNA on ten different tissues from the ferrets (Fig 8A) as well as by virus isolations (S5C Fig). By one d.p.e., viral RNA was detected in the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and in lung tissues, and by three d.p.e., HeV RNA was also recovered from the spleen, thymus and brain, suggesting neurotrophic spread characteristic of henipavirus disease. The higher viral RNA loads observed in the lung, lymph nodes and spleen is congruent with previous HeV infection studies performed in ferrets [50]. We next purified total small RNA from serum samples (from all days except for day six), and then performed qRT-PCR using a primer specific for miR-181a and miR-181d. We found that, as early as one d.p.e., miR-181a and miR-181d became elevated in the serum of these ferrets during the course of infection (Fig 8B). Reminiscent of what was observed in mice treated with LPS [46], this early up-regulation appears to be transient, as by day three, levels of miR-181a and miR-181d began dropping to baseline levels.\\n\\nNatural HeV outbreaks occur in horses, causing severe febrile illness associated with respiratory and neurologic signs. Accordingly, horses serve as another animal model for respiratory and neurologic HeV disease. A HeV infection study involving three experimental horses was previously described [52]. Here, total small RNA was purified from the stored blood samples of these horses, and the relative expression of miR-181a and miR-181d on 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 d.p.e. were determined by qRT-PCR (Fig 8C). Similar to results observed in ferret, transient yet significant increases in circulating miR-181 molecules were observed during the early stages of infection. Collectively, these observations demonstrate in two different in vivo models that members of the miR-181 family are up-regulated early in the host during HeV infection, implicating a biological role for miR-181 in host immunity as well as in henipavirus pathogenesis.\\n\\nThe development of novel therapeutics for viruses of clinical significance relies on our knowledge of the dynamic interplay between the virus and the human host, and our ability to apply such knowledge to disrupt the viral dependence on host factors. However, progress in our understanding of virus-host interactions of many deadly viruses of significant public health importance (e.g. Ebola, MERS, Nipah virus) is hampered by the high-cost and technical challenges associated with studying these viruses under BSL-3 or BSL-4 conditions. To circumvent these issues, different strategies and approaches have been developed, such as the use of pseudotyped particles [53] or minigenome assays [54]. These approaches, though of much utility, have their shortcomings; in particular, they cannot fully reproduce the entire life cycle of the virus. Therefore, significant progress still needs to be made towards the development and validation of our capabilities to perform technically-challenging experiments in high biocontainment environments.\\n\\nIn recent years functional genomics has become a popular research approach for unbiased discoveries of novel genes and molecular pathways involved in a particular biological process. For infectious diseases, functional genomics has demonstrated much power in its ability to dissect the dynamic interplay between host and viral factors during a virus infection, paving the way for novel drug targets. For instance, a haploid genetic screen resulted in the discovery of the once elusive entry receptor for Ebola virus [55]. That said, methods used in functional genomics, such as high-throughput RNAi screens, are technically challenging and laborious, especially at BSL-4.\\n\\nIn this report, we screened 834 host miRNAs, using both engineered agonists and antagonists, for their ability to enhance or inhibit infection of HeV in human cells. As two complementary screens were performed, we exploited this duality and cross-referenced the two screens to increase our confidence in the top hits. Both complementary screens converged on members of four miRNA families (miR-181, miR-17~93, miR-520h, miR-548d) that strongly promoted henipavirus infection. Since all four members of the miR-181 family were pro-viral hits using this approach, we focused our validation efforts on miR-181. We show that miR-181 promoted infection of both wild-type HeV and NiV infections. Interestingly, this infection enhancement seems to be primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to significantly augment henipavirus glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion, implicating miR-181 in the enhancement of henipavirus entry. Congruent with this notion, viral RNA synthesis in a single round of infection is elevated in cells transfected with miR-181 agonists. This pro-fusion effect is specific to the miR-181 family, as transfection with agonists of another strongly pro-viral miRNA (miR-17), did not appreciably alter syncytia formation. Since henipavirus mediated cell-cell fusion is both a surrogate model for virus entry as well as a natural phenomenon during late stages of infection, it is likely that in addition to enhancing henipavirus entry, miR-181 also promotes more efficient cell-to-cell spread of this virus by merging the cytosols of neighbouring cells more rapidly. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of subversion of a host miRNA by a virus to promote entry and membrane fusion.\\n\\nInvestigation into the pro-fusion mechanism of miR-181 led us to hypothesize that Eph receptors, the cellular binding partners of the henipavirus entry mediators ephrin-B2 and -B3, may act as potent anti-fusion regulators. Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands are involved in intracellular signalling via direct cell-cell contact and receptor-ligand interactions [56]. These molecules are divided into two different classes (A and B), and Ephs of a particular class tend to bind to ephrins of the corresponding class [57]. Exceptions to the rule exist, such as the ability of EphB2 to bind to ephrin-A5 [58]. Initial in silico analysis revealed that EphA4, EphA5 and EphA7 possess putative miR-181 binding sites in the 3\\u2019 UTRs of their transcripts. Our experiments subsequently showed that EphA5 and EphA7, but not EphA4, are novel suppressors of the fusiogenic effects of henipavirus glycoproteins. Importantly, levels of EphA5 and EphA7, but not EphA4, are reduced by overexpression of both miR-181a and miR-181d, indicating that these class A Ephs are target genes for the miR-181 family, and that the pro-fusion phenotype of miR-181 are, at least in part, due to its downregulation of specific class A Ephs.\\n\\nWe also demonstrated, using an approach different from a previous study [38], that EphB4, an Eph receptor from the same class as the henipavirus entry receptors, has potent anti-fusion characteristics. Indeed, at comparable knockdown levels, siRNAs to EphB4 increased syncytia formation significantly more than siRNAs to EphA5 or EphA7 (Fig 7A and 7C). This data also lends support to the notion originally proposed by Bossart et al. (2008) that class B Ephs can compete with henipavirus glycoproteins for binding to entry receptors to hamper virus entry. Intriguingly, even though the 3\\u2019UTR of EphB4 transcripts does not contain any sequence that is complementary to the seed region of miR-181, EphB4 levels were downregulated by miR-181 expression. Though less commonly reported, miRNAs can modulate gene expression by binding to the coding region of mRNAs [59]. Accordingly, human EphB4 does contain a putative miR-181 binding site in its ORF, providing an avenue for miR-181 regulation of its expression.\\n\\nSince EphA5 and EphA7 do not interact with class B ephrins [56], it is likely the effects of downregulated EphA5 and EphA7 on promoting henipavirus fusion is indirect. One possibility is that since some crosstalk already exists between the two classes of the Eph-ephrin interaction network (e.g. EphB2 with ephrin-A5 [58]) [57], downregulation of some molecules in the network may have broader, indirect effects on the availability of other molecules in the system, including the ephrins utilized by henipaviruses. For instance, repression of EphA5 and EphA7 expression will free up more ephrin-A molecules, including ephrin-A5. The increased level of unbound ephrin-A5 results in its sequestration of EphB2 and thereby make more ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 molecules available for binding by the henipavirus glycoproteins.\\n\\nAlternatively, EphA5 and EphA7 may act directly on ephrin-B2 and B3 to regulate fusion, but via lateral cis interactions on the same cell. It was more recently shown that the canonical intra-class binding rule may only apply for trans interactions [42]. For example, via lateral cis interactions, ephrin-B2 can attenuate the trans ligand-binding capacity of EphA3 and its activation, even though ephrin-B2 does not bind to EphA3 by canonical trans interaction [42]. This cis inhibition of EphA3 by ephrin-B2 implies that cis interactions do not exhibit the same receptor-ligand selectivity as trans interactions, providing a possible non-canonical mechanism for EphA5 and EphA7 to modulate ephrin-B2 activity.\\n\\nCollectively, our data supports a model where simultaneous inhibition of multiple anti-fusion Ephs from both receptor classes by miR-181 contributes to greatly enhanced membrane fusion and infection. Considering that EphB4 is most antagonistic towards fusion (Fig 7C), it likely makes the most significant contribution to the pro-fusion phenotype of miR-181. Though this is the first report of a host miRNA that promotes virus fusion by suppressing anti-fusion receptors, there is some precedence for host receptor-ligand interactions that negatively regulate virus entry. Natural host ligands (i.e. BTLA and LT\\u03b1) of the herpes simplex virus entry receptor, HVEM, can inhibit binding of the virus glycoprotein gD to HVEM and suppress infection [60]. Additionally, nectin members can compete with the measles virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein for binding to its exit receptor nectin-4 [61, 62].\\n\\nEven though the role of miR-181 in inflammation and NKT-cell maturation has been documented [23, 43\\u201346], little has been reported about its role in the infection of other viruses. In stark contrast to henipaviruses, miR-181 has been shown to be inhibit infection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [63]. Interestingly, this inhibition occurs at PRRSV host entry and is achieved by targeting the entry receptor CD163 for downregulation [64].\\n\\nWe found that miR-181 did not affect infection by paramyxoviruses from other genera, indicating specificity in the henipavirus-miR181 virus-host interaction. This supports the model that miR-181 enhances syncytia formation by targeting Ephs that naturally associate with the henipavirus entry receptors ephrin-B2 and B3. On the other hand, miR-17 enhances the infection of HeV as well as RSV, suggesting that the pro-viral effects of miR-17 are broadly applied to the paramyxovirus family, and perhaps beyond this family. For instance, miR-17 has recently been shown to be critical for the replication of pestiviruses, primarily via enhancing viral translation and vRNA stability [12]. Cross-referencing of results from the siRNA screen of host genes associated with HeV infection suggests that miR-181 and miR-17~93 target multiple host genes which are anti-viral for HeV, and that the net outcome of cellular expression of miR-181 or miR-17~93 is likely a host microenvironment that is more conducive for henipavirus infection. These results indicate that, in addition to its role in regulating fusion, miR-181 might act via other anti-viral host mediators to induce a situation that is broadly supportive of henipavirus replication. Consistent with this, we observed that miR-181 is up-regulated in sera of ferrets and blood of horses as early as day 1 during a henipavirus infection. It is tempting to speculate that the host pro-inflammatory response (of which blood miR-181 is correlated with) promotes the early phase of virus spread in the host, thereby contributing to disease progression and pathogenesis [43, 44, 46]. Along similar lines, but in a chronic infection, serum miR-181b is positively correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels in human patients, and with disease progression of chronic HBV infection [65]. The model of miR-181-mediated immune pathogenesis has potential implications for risk factors associated with susceptibility to henipavirus disease, as well as for the strategic design and development of novel immunotherapy for henipavirus infections.\\n\\nDirect binding interactions between host miRNAs and viral genomes have been reported for certain RNA viruses like EEEV and pestivirus [11, 12]. These interactions often have functional relevance in terms of supporting viral replication. It was recently first demonstrated that the functional RNAi protein Argonaute preferentially associates with certain subgenomic segments of paramyxoviruses as well [12]. In particular, a higher abundance of Argonaute association with M and N segments of the hMPV RNA was observed relative to the L segment. Due to limited resolution in the AGO-CLIP analysis in that study, whether these physical interactions involve specific host miRNAs remains to be addressed. Considering that our complementary screens identified multiple miRNAs that support henipavirus infection, an interesting subject for future studies would be to investigate whether the pro-viral miRNAs which we identified here bind to the genomes of paramyxoviruses, and whether such interactions have functional roles in supporting infection.\\n\\nIn summary, these dual screens further the understanding of the role of host-derived small noncoding RNAs in the infection cycle of henipaviruses, and provide a miRNA-based resource for the study of viruses from the order mononegavirales, including members of both the filovirus and paramyxovirus families, which presents significant threats to human and animal health. This study implicates miR-181 and certain class A Eph receptors as critical modulators of henipavirus membrane fusion, and highlights how the natural innate immune response of the host can be exploited by a RNA virus to promote cell-to-cell spread.\\n\\nHeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) and African green monkey kidney epithelial Vero cells (ATCC CRL-81) were maintained in growth medium comprised of DMEM GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) and HEK 293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) were maintained in growth medium comprised of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM MEM sodium pyruvate and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37\\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\\n\\nAll virology work was conducted at the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory. Recombinant HeV, wild-type HeV (both Hendra virus/horse/1994/Hendra), NiV (Nipah virus/Malaysia/human/99), MeV (wild type Edmonston strain), MuV (Enders strain) and RSV (strain A2) were passaged in Vero cells. Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (kind gift, Professor Lorena Brown, University of Melbourne) was passaged in the allantoic fluid of 10-day embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs. HeV and NiV were handled under BSL-4 conditions, MeV and MuV at BSL-3, and RSV and influenza A/WSN/33 at BSL-2. All viruses were aliquoted and stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C for inoculations.\\n\\nHigh throughput miRNA agonist and antagonist screens were performed largely as described [14]. Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected in 384 well plates with miRIDIAN miRNA agonist and antagonist (final concentration 25 nM) libraries using DharmaFECT (DF) 1 lipid transfection reagent (Dharmacon RNAi Technologies, GE, Lafayette, Colorado, USA). Genome-wide miRNA libraries (catalog numbers in S1 Table and S2 Table) were screened at the Victorian Centre for Functional Genomics (VCFG). At 72 h post transfection, in parallel with the point of HeV infection, cell viability for each well was assessed by fixing (4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min) and staining plates with the nuclear stain 4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; 1 \\u03bcg/ml for 20 min in phosphate buffered saline). HeV infection was quantitated in separate plates suitable for luminescence assays. 72 h post-transfection, cells were infected with recombinant HeV (MOI 0.1 using a BioTek 406 liquid handler housed in a class II biosafety cabinet at BSL-4. At 24 hours post-infection, media was removed and 20 \\u03bcL of PBS added per well. Luminescence was then measured by addition of 20 \\u03bcL of Bright-Glo Luciferase reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) and reading on a Synergy H4 multimode microplate reader (BioTek).\\n\\nData analysis was performed as described [14]. The experimental robustness was evaluated for each screened plate using the Z\\u2019 factor calculation [20], comparing the negative control (siNEG), positive control (siLUC) and death control (siPLK1) for both cell viability and HeV infection. Robust z score = (sample value-sample median)/sample median absolute deviation was used as the hit identification method [20, 66].\\n\\nFor work subsequent to the miRNA screens, HeLa cells were seeded overnight in 96-well plates (8 \\u00d7 103 cells/well) in growth medium. The following day, growth medium was replaced with antibiotic-free medium (DMEM with GlutaMAX, 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum) (100 \\u03bcL/well) before cells were transfected with miRNA agonists at a final concentration of 25 nM. Cells were then incubated at 37\\u00b0C for 72 h (media was changed to growth media at 24 h-post transfection).\\n\\nTCID50 assays were performed as described [22]. Infectious virus titre was then calculated in accordance with the method described by Reed and Muench [67].\\n\\nMDCK cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1 x 106 cells/well) in growth media. The following day, cells were washed with PBS and media was changed in order to ensure the removal of any detached cells. When cell confluency reached 100%, 10-fold serial dilutions of influenza virus stocks in FCS-free media (RPMI 1640, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM MEM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin) were prepared. Cells were then washed with FCS-free media, infected with 500 \\u03bcL of the appropriate viral dilution and incubated at 37\\u00b0C for 45 minutes, with gentle shaking every 15 minutes. 2 \\u00d7 L15 medium was then mixed with 1.8% (w/v) pre-autoclaved agarose and added to cells. Cells were incubated at 37\\u00b0C for 3 days. Following incubation, cells were fixed with 5% (v/v) formaldehyde for 1 h. The agarose overlay was then removed and cells were stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet, diluted in 4% (v/v) ethanol. After 10 minutes of staining, cell monolayers were rinsed with water and visible plaques were counted by eye.\\n\\nImmunofluorescence microscopy was performed largely as described [14]. Cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, stained with primary antibodies to viral antigens and analysed using an automated Thermo Fisher Scientific CellInsight Imaging System. HeLa cells in 96 well plates were imaged at a magnification of 10 x, 49 fields/well representing the entire well. The percentage of infected cells was quantified using the Target Activation bioapplication of the Cellomics Scan software and was determined by dividing the number of antigen-positive cells by the total cell number, multiplied by 100.\\n\\nHeV-F and -G mediated fusion assays were performed as described previously [14].\\n\\nQuantitative RT-PCR for HeV RNA was performed as described previously [14].\\n\\nFor the Eph-ephrin experiments, total RNA was purified from agonist or siRNA-transfected HeLa cells using the RNeasy Plus RNA purification kit from Qiagen (USA) and stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C. cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR green (Invitrogen) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). PCR cycling for gene detection was at 95\\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\\u00b0C for 1 min. A melting curve analysis was performed to check for primer-dimer artifacts and to verify assay specificity. PCR primers were purchased from GeneWorks Ltd (Adelaide, Australia). Data were analyzed using the \\u0394\\u0394CT method and were normalized to GAPDH for mRNA detection. qRT-PCR for HeV RNA during the infection time-course experiments were performed as described previously [14].\\n\\nAll animal studies were approved by the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory\\u2019s Animal Ethics Committee (document #1568) and conducted following the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes guidelines for housing and care of laboratory animals.\\n\\nSixteen ferrets (aged 12\\u201318 months) were exposed to 5000 TCID50 of Hendra virus/Australia/Horse/2008/Redlands by the oronasal route as previously described [50]. Prior to any manipulations, animals were immobilised with a mixture of ketamine HCl (3 mg/kg) and medetomidine (30 \\u03bcg/kg); atimepazole was administered for reversal at 50% of the medetomidine dose. After virus exposure, animals were monitored for changes in play activity, other clinical signs of disease, and fever. They were randomly assigned to euthanasia on post-exposure days 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 or 7, when clinical samples including nasal washes, mucosal swabs, blood and urine were collected together with multiple tissue specimens. qRT-PCR and viral loads from the tissues were assessed as described previously [50].\\n\\nEDTA blood samples from horse infected with HeV were derived from an experimental time-series trial [52]. Ferret sera were collected as described above. Total RNA (including small RNAs) was harvested using Tri-reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) following manufacturer's instructions. Phase separation was achieved by adding 200 \\u03bcL chloroform to each tube, shaking vigorously and incubating samples for a further 3 min at room temperature, prior to centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4\\u00b0C. The aqueous upper phase of each sample was then placed in a new tube, before the addition of 10 \\u03bcg (0.5 \\u03bcL) of glycogen and 250 \\u03bcL of isopropanol. Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to being centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4\\u00b0C. The supernatants were then removed, and each RNA pellet was washed with 500 \\u03bcL 75% (v/v) ethanol before being centrifuged at 7500 x g for 5 min at 4\\u00b0C. RNA was then resuspended in 20 \\u03bcL of RNase-free water.\\n\\nPrior to cDNA synthesis, RNA samples (1 \\u03bcg) were treated with RNase-free DNase according to manufacturer\\u2019s instructions (Promega). DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Exiqon miRCURY LNA Universal RT miRNA PCR kit, according to manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. qRT-PCR preparation was also performed using the Exiqon miRCURY LNA Universal RT miRNA PCR kit, which included miR-181 and U6primers. For each reaction, 5 \\u03bcL PCR Master Mix and 1 \\u03bcL PCR Primer Mix were added to 4 \\u03bcL (5 ng) of the diluted cDNA template. qRT-PCR analysis was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR System. Cycling conditions began with 10 min at 95\\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 95\\u00b0C for 10 seconds and 60\\u00b0C for 1 minute. Following qRT-PCR, miR-181 expression was analysed using the \\u0394\\u0394CT method and normalised to U6.\\n\\nAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. The difference between treatment and control groups was analysed using a two-tailed Student\\u2019s t test, with a P value of <0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Error bars represent standard deviations, and all data points are the average of a minimum of 3 replicates.\\n\",\n          \"Mosquito-borne diseases represent one of the most severe public health burdens worldwide. For example, dengue viruses that are primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have rapidly increased in prevalence in recent years [1]. One recent study estimated that around 3.9 billion people, in over 100 countries, live in regions \\u2018at risk\\u2019 for dengue infections [2], with \\u223c390 million dengue infections per year [3] of which perhaps 50-100 million cases are symptomatic [4]. Of these cases \\u223c3.9 million are classified as severe and 9,000 are fatal [4]. The methods currently used to control dengue do not appear sufficient to eliminate the problem and this is exacerbated by the lack of drug treatments presently available [5]. A first dengue vaccine has recently been licensed, however it is only recommended for use in individuals over nine years of age that live in areas of high dengue burden [6, 7]. Thus, while it may prove a useful tool in some situations, it appears unlikely to be sufficient for eliminating the threat of dengue. As such, a number of additional methods for the control of dengue and other vector-borne diseases are currently being investigated.\\n\\nGenetic control methods are one such alternative and, with advances in tools available to molecular biologists, have become a realistic prospect in recent years. In particular, a range of gene drive systems have been proposed that could, in theory, be used to spread desirable genetic traits through a mosquito population [10]. Each of these systems would be implemented by introducing individuals carrying the drive system into the wild where they mate with existing mosquito populations. This potentially gives them an edge over traditional control methods since they exploit the natural behaviour of mosquitoes to seek mates and find breeding/resting sites which can be extremely difficult for humans to locate and reach. These genetic systems can be classified in a number of ways that include their intended effect, persistence and invasiveness, each of which affect how they may be viewed both by the public and regulators [10]. Two such classes of gene drive that are currently under development in our research group for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are two-locus engineered underdominance (UD) and killer-rescue (KR). These have both attracted attention due to their potential to mitigate a number of key regulatory concerns.\\n\\nUnderdominance is a phenomenon most commonly thought of in the context of two or more alleles at a single genetic locus. It refers to the scenario whereby individuals heterozygous at a given genetic locus are less fit than either of the homozygote states and is the inverse of the better known hybrid vigour. UD systems, as proposed by Davis et al. [8], seek to attain a similar effect through a reduction in the fitness of hybrids between parental strains. This is achieved via the introduction of two independently inherited transgenic constructs inserted at unlinked loci (Fig 1). Each of these transgenic constructs carries a lethal genetic element, a suppressor for the lethal at the other locus and a \\u201ccargo\\u201d gene conferring a desirable phenotype. The requirement for lethal effectors within UD systems leads to a number of challenges for design and construction of such systems. It is theoretically possible to engineer these systems sequentially. However, their development and testing will be much simpler if lethal genes are either conditionally lethal, repressible or incompletely lethal. Within this study we restrict our attention to cargo genes that render individuals refractory to one or more viruses (i.e. a reduced vector competence trait), significantly reducing their capacity for infecting humans. Further, this trait is assumed to be dominant meaning it will be fully effective in a single copy. Such refractory genes have already been developed, for example those of Franz and colleagues [11, 12], with further examples likely in development. Under such a system [8], individuals (other than wild-type) that do not inherit at least one copy of each transgenic construct are non-viable because they carry one of the lethal genes but lack the relevant suppressor. This creates a selection pressure for individuals to carry both constructs or neither. Under certain conditions this can theoretically allow the transgenic constructs, and crucially, the cargo (refractory) gene(s) to spread toward fixation within a population if they are introduced at a sufficiently high frequency. Due to the ongoing selection pressure for individuals to carry both transgenic constructs, it is expected that, in absence of resistance or mutation, the introduced transgenes will persist indefinitely. Thus, it is anticipated that in such situations the prevalence of infections within a targeted area could be significantly reduced, or even eliminated.\\n\\nThe UD system is essentially composed of two orthogonal KR systems [9], and a key developmental milestone will be the construction and testing of one/both KR system(s). Hence, we consider here the behaviour of this class of gene drive system also. In this case one lethal (killer) and one suppressor (rescue) gene are independently inherited and inserted at unlinked loci (Fig 1). As long as it is common within the population, the deleterious effect of the lethal transgene creates a selective pressure for individuals to also carry copies of the suppressor gene. This causes the suppressor (rescue) construct to increase in frequency within the population. However, this selective pressure is diminished as the lethal becomes more rare (due to fitness costs). Thus the suppressor too begins to reduce in frequency (assuming it confers some fitness cost). In theory this eventually leads to elimination of both transgenic constructs and thus a return to the pre-release state. Such systems are interesting for the control of dengue vectors since they may reduce the number of mosquitoes capable of transmitting viruses sufficiently to disrupt disease transmission. If so, the pathogen could be eliminated without removing the mosquito species from its ecological niche.\\n\\nThe power of such systems to alter natural populations has led to some concerns about ways in which they should be regulated to ensure they are used safely [13, 14]. Thus it is important to consider how such systems may be viewed in terms of a number of key issues. Questions considered important in this context include the following. Will a gene drive spread into regions that did not authorise the use of genetically modified mosquitoes? If so, what effects will they have in the non-target area? Can the gene drive be reversed/recalled in the event of unanticipated/undesirable effects? These questions will be addressed in the work presented here.\\n\\nPrevious modelling work has demonstrated that\\u2014in absence of resistance or mutation\\u2014UD systems should persist indefinitely provided that they are introduced above some threshold transgene frequency [8, 15]. Below this threshold the transgene will simply be eliminated from the population due to both the associated fitness costs and genetic drift. For realistic rates of dispersal between two neighbouring mosquito populations, it has been shown that the flow of transgenes from a targeted population is not likely to be sufficient to exceed the threshold in the neighbouring population [16, 17]. This implies that the UD gene drive system is unlikely to spread, at any significant frequency, into neighbouring regions. These results have been considered within a discrete population structure, however isolation-by-distance may be a more appropriate consideration for some populations. A number of previous studies have considered such a population structure in the context of an advantageous gene or chromosome rearrangements (e.g. [60\\u201364]) but, to our knowledge, not in the context of two-locus gene drive systems such as those studied here. The existence of the threshold transgene frequency should also allow for the UD system to be recalled by introducing sufficient numbers of wild-type mosquitoes back into the population such that the transgene frequency falls below the threshold, thus causing the effect of the fitness cost to exceed the strength of the genetic drive mechanism.\\n\\nDue to their self-limiting nature, KR systems may be viewed as an ideal system with which to test the effects of a given cargo gene before they are incorporated into self-sustaining systems. However, in spite of the fact that KR is inherently self-limiting, the same regulatory questions are still likely to need addressing. Modelling work has demonstrated that KR transgenes can spread into neighbouring populations at appreciable frequencies and then be eliminated due to their self-limiting nature. For example, the modelling work of Marshall & Hay [16] considered the case of a KR system with heterozygous and homozygous fitness costs of 2.5% and 5%, respectively for each allele and 1% migration between two neighbouring populations. When considering an initial transgene frequency of 0.5, maximum transgene frequencies of \\u223c0.95 and \\u223c0.3 were reached in the target and neighbouring populations, respectively. To our knowledge there have been no formal recall mechanisms detailed for KR systems as they should naturally diminish in time. However, releasing wild-type individuals into the population would lower the transgene frequency, and should result in more rapid transgene elimination.\\n\\nMuch of the previous modelling work on UD and KR systems has assumed a discrete (non-overlapping) generation framework in order to study the population genetics of these systems [8, 9, 15, 16, 18]. The works of Huang et al. [19, 20] considered the effects of age and spatial structure in a mosquito population in the context of the UD system. A large number of ecological factors have been included in studies of KR systems using the simulation model Skeeter Buster [21, 22], however the individual effects of each are not easily separated in such a complex model. Here we aim to further the understanding of how ecological factors affect the efficacy of UD gene drive systems and disentangle their effects from one another in the case of KR systems.\\n\\nHere we begin by formulating population dynamics models of UD and KR gene drive systems that include a number of ecological factors such as the number of breeding sites; strength of density dependent larval competition; population growth rate; adult mortality rate; and rates of migration between two populations. These models also capture a number of characteristics of the control measures including the amount of mosquitoes released; the sexes released (release of males and females in 1:1 ratio (\\u201cbisex release\\u201d) or male-only release); fitness costs of introduced transgenes; sexes affected by lethal effects (bisex lethality or female-specific); whether one copy of a suppressor construct is sufficient to counter two copies of the related lethal construct; and the timing of the fitness/lethal effects (early- or late-acting). These models are first used to investigate the effects of the ecological factors considered here on the equilibrium size of a mosquito population in absence of control. We then go on to explore how such variation in mosquito population size (due to numbers of breeding sites) impacts upon UD or KR gene drive systems in terms of threshold transgene frequencies, relative degrees of population suppression and the time-scales of action. The strength of density dependent larval competition is then considered in terms of its effects on the observed dynamics of UD and KR systems as well as the thresholds for transgene introgression (UD) or increases in rescue transgene frequency (KR). Finally, using adjusted versions of the models we consider how rates of migration between a target and a non-target mosquito population can impact upon the efficacy of UD and KR gene drives and discuss results in terms of the desirability of observed outcomes. Whilst we present results for Ae. aegypti mosquito populations, we expect the models presented to be equally applicable for other species given a suitable parameterisation of the models.\\n\\nHere we present a population dynamics model that may be used flexibly to describe both the UD and KR systems shown in Fig 1. With appropriate choices of lethality parameters, we anticipate this model could also be used to represent some alternative classes of gene drive such as Medusa [58] and reciprocal chromosome translocations [59]. We also believe this model to be both simple and general enough as to be equally applicable to other species. However, we restrict our attention to Ae. aegypti due to both the ongoing development of these systems and the availability of parameter values in the previous literature. This model is based on those of Yakob & Bonsall [23] and Alphey & Bonsall [24] in that it is a deterministic representation of a panmictic (randomly mating) population with continuous reproduction and a 1:1 male to female ratio both in the initial population and in the eggs laid in subsequent generations. Further, this model assumes that transgenic constructs do not display any sex linkage, will not mutate and the individual genetic components at a given locus will not separate. We also assume here that resistance alleles will not emerge within the population. In such systems, the introduction of two independently inherited transgenic constructs at unlinked loci results in a total of nine possible genotypes. Within this work these are referred to by a collection of four letters depending on the presence (A and B) or absence (a and b) of the two transgenic constructs and assigned a number (i = 1,\\u2026,9) in order to simplify notation within the mathematical model (see Table 1). For example, an individual that is heterozygous for both transgenic constructs will be denoted AaBb and assigned a genotype number i = 5.\\n\\nWe consider the overall fitness (\\u03a9i) of each genotype (relative to wild-type individuals) to be composed of the lethal effects from transgenic constructs (\\u03b3i) and the fitness costs associated with the insertion of transgenes into the mosquito genome. Within the mathematical model these effects are captured by\\n\\u03a9 i M , F = \\u03f5 A \\u03b7 i A \\u03f5 B \\u03b7 i B ( 1 - \\u03b3 i M , F ) , (1)\\nwhere \\u03f5A and \\u03f5B denote the relative fitness of individuals carrying one copy of transgenic constructs A and B, respectively. These fitness effects manifest themselves as differences in the rates of survival of transgenic individuals relative to their wild-type counterparts. Note that the fitness cost associated with a particular choice of relative fitness parameter may be calculated as 1 \\u2212 \\u03f5A or 1 \\u2212 \\u03f5B. These are applied multiplicatively such that, for example, an individual carrying two copies of construct A has relative fitness \\u03f5 A 2 while a double heterozygote has relative fitness \\u03f5 A 1 \\u03f5 B 1. For details on the number of copies of each transgenic construct carried by a given genotype see Table 1. Here a value of \\u03f5 = 1 means an individual is as fit as a wild-type individual whereas \\u03f5 = 0 represents a completely non-viable individual. The other component of an individual\\u2019s overall fitness is the lethal effect of the carried transgenes (\\u03b3i). In this case \\u03b3i = 0 means that individuals of genotype i are 100% viable whereas individuals with \\u03b3i = 1 receive a 100% lethal effect. Note that some systems may exhibit incomplete penetrance of lethal transgenes (i.e. 0 < \\u03b3i < 1), however this is beyond the scope of this study. Parameter values describing the lethal effects of transgenes on each genotype in UD and KR systems are summarised in Table 1. Note that as in a previous population genetics study of UD [18] we here consider the possibility that different numbers of suppressor copies may be required to nullify the effect of the associated lethals. These are termed a \\u201cstrongly suppressed\\u201d system when one suppressor copy is sufficient to nullify two copies of a given lethal or a \\u201cweakly suppressed\\u201d system where two suppressor copies are required to nullify the effect of two lethal copies.\\n\\nIt is now possible to outline a set of equations describing the dynamics of each mosquito genotype in time. As with the work of Alphey & Bonsall [24], the models presented here are adaptations of Kostitzin\\u2019s [33] work that used Lotka-Volterra type equations to represent competition between different genotypes. These models also consider a nonlinear representation of intraspecific competition due to Maynard Smith & Slatkin [34] that can describe a wide range of density dependence scenarios [35]. We also consider two sets of equations representing distinct scenarios in terms of the developmental stage at which fitness/lethal effects of transgenic constructs act. In particular, we consider the cases where these effects are either \\u201cearly-acting\\u201d; taking effect before density-dependent competition (e.g. in eggs/early instar larvae) or \\u201clate-acting\\u201d; having an impact after density-dependent competition and before mating (eg. in pupae or pharate adults). This results in the following equations\\n\\nEarly-acting fitness/lethal effects:\\nd M i ( t ) d t = \\u03c1 v i ( t - \\u03c4 ) \\u03a9 i M 1 + ( \\u2211 i \\u2208 \\u03c3 \\u03b1 [ v i ( t - \\u03c4 ) \\u03a9 i M + w i ( t - \\u03c4 ) \\u03a9 i F ] ) \\u03b2 - \\u03bc M i ( t ) , (2)\\nd F i ( t ) d t = \\u03c1 w i ( t - \\u03c4 ) \\u03a9 i F 1 + ( \\u2211 i \\u2208 \\u03c3 \\u03b1 [ v i ( t - \\u03c4 ) \\u03a9 i M + w i ( t - \\u03c4 ) \\u03a9 i F ] ) \\u03b2 - \\u03bc F i ( t ) , (3)\\n\\nLate-acting fitness/lethal effects:\\nd M i ( t ) d t = \\u03c1 v i ( t - \\u03c4 ) \\u03a9 i M 1 + ( \\u2211 i \\u2208 \\u03c3 \\u03b1 [ v i ( t - \\u03c4 ) + w i ( t - \\u03c4 ) ] ) \\u03b2 - \\u03bc M i ( t ) , (4)\\nd F i ( t ) d t = \\u03c1 w i ( t - \\u03c4 ) \\u03a9 i F 1 + ( \\u2211 i \\u2208 \\u03c3 \\u03b1 [ v i ( t - \\u03c4 ) + w i ( t - \\u03c4 ) ] ) \\u03b2 - \\u03bc F i ( t ) . (5)\\n\\nNote that these two models are identical except for the removal of the fitness/lethal effect parameter (\\u03a9) from the denominator of the late-acting model since these effects do not act until after the density dependent phase. A limitation of such models is that density dependent competition may only occur between larvae born at the same time. Definitions of parameters and variables are given in Table 2 alongside a base set of parameter values used throughout this study. Expressions for vi and wi are outlined in S1 Appendix Section 1 and S1 Table alongside details regarding the implementation of release ratios (and therefore initial conditions) and transgene frequency calculations.\\n\\nAs discussed above, one of the key concerns associated with gene drive systems is the degree to which they might affect non-target, neighbouring populations. In order to assess how population dynamics can impact upon the ability of a system to spread into a neighbouring population, we formulate here a two-deme population dynamics model (Fig 2). This is used to investigate both the spread of transgenes into the neighbouring population and changes (lasting or transient) in the overall size of a neighbouring population. Two-deme models such as this are well established in the literature for population genetics models of gene drive systems (for example [16, 36, 37]) but these models rarely incorporate population dynamics in addition to genetics. We considered that for gene drive systems predicted to cause significant excess mortality, consideration of population dynamics might be important.\\n\\nThe consideration of two demes requires some modifications to be made to the equations stated in the previous section. Firstly, since we are now modelling the dynamics of two populations, we must consider an extra set of delay-differential equations representing the second (non-target) population. These take the same form as those given in the previous section except for the incorporation of migration between the two demes. This is achieved through the addition of extra terms into each equation which are of the form \\u03c8 ( M i O ( t ) - M i T ( t ) ) for the target population and \\u03c8 ( M i T ( t ) - M i O ( t ) ) for the non-target population. Here the superscripts T and O denote the target and non-target populations, respectively. Similar terms are also included for female populations but with M replaced by F.

Note that migration terms do not include any developmental time delays since this is assumed to comprise adult mosquitoes moving from one deme to the other prior to mating on a given day. Here we have excluded from our model the possibility of human-mediated movement of mosquito eggs as this is likely to be negligible relative to adult movement on the spatial scale considered here. It is also worth noting that models not including migration are a special case of those presented here with the rate of migration set to zero (i.e. \\u03c8 = 0). All numerical simulations within this study are created using MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) delay differential equation solver dde23 [38].\\n\\nThe mathematical models outlined in the previous section contain a number of ecological parameters, namely the carrying capacity, primarily based on the number and quality of breeding sites (i.e. carrying capacity is proportional to 1/\\u03b1); the strength of density-dependent larval competition (\\u03b2); the intrinsic per capita rate of population growth (\\u03c1); and the adult mortality rate (\\u03bc). Before investigating the impact of such ecological parameters on the efficacy of UD and KR gene drive systems, we begin by studying their effects on the overall size of an isolated mosquito population in absence of genetic control. This can be investigated by considering the steady-state equation defined by Alphey & Bonsall [24], i.e.\\nN * = 1 \\u03b1 ( \\u03c1 \\u03bc - 1 ) 1 / \\u03b2 , (14)\\nwhere N* denotes the equilibrium population size in absence of control.\\n\\nWe now investigate the effects of each parameter on the overall equilibrium population size by considering variations in each while the other three are held constant\\u2014at the base values detailed in Table 2. Since little is known about these ecological parameters in wild populations we vary each over a range wide enough that it is likely to span both realistic and biologically unfeasible scenarios. This gives results as shown in Fig 3.\\n\\nThese results clearly show that, in a mathematical model of this type, each of the four ecological parameters are able to significantly affect the equilibrium population size. We see from Fig 3(a) and 3(c) that parameters related to density-dependent larval competition (i.e. \\u03b1 and \\u03b2) have the largest impact on the overall population size. The intrinsic per capita rate of population growth (\\u03c1) and the adult mortality rate (\\u03bc) are also capable of altering the overall equilibrium population size, but over a much smaller range than is possible with \\u03b1 and \\u03b2. It is clearly possible here for variations in these parameters to result in very large or small population sizes. It is expected that these results span both realistic and biologically non-feasible population sizes. Combining mathematical models and data on population sizes (e.g. [39]) can help to narrow down the realistic parameter range, however further experimental data is required to refine these yet further.\\n\\nThe previous section explored the effects of various ecological parameters on the overall size of a mosquito population. We now examine whether such changes in the overall size of a population before the release of transgenic mosquitoes will impact upon the outcome or dynamics of UD and KR gene drive releases. We explore this in the context of a number of important performance metrics. In order to explore these effects we simulate a 1:1 (introduced:wild) release of each gene drive system. This release is modelled as the introduction of AABB genotype adults at a ratio equal to the number of wild-type adult mosquitoes (at equilibrium) at the time of release (see Supplementary Information Section 1 for further details). We explore this release strategy over the full range of relative fitness parameters (i.e. 0 \\u2264 \\u03f5A/B \\u2264 1) and for a number of different initial mosquito population sizes.\\n\\nFor changes in the initial population size, we consider only changes to the availability of larval habitats within an environment (proportional to 1/\\u03b1). Specifically, we consider eight different initial population sizes spanning five orders of magnitude (100 to 104), corresponding to \\u03b1 values of 0.7, 0.2, 0.07, 0.02, 0.007, 0.002, 0.0007 and 0.0002 (see Fig 3(a)). To explore whether these changes in population size alter the behaviour of the systems studied here, we consider a number of metrics that represent different aspects of their performance. For the UD system we consider three performance metrics, namely the change in equilibrium population size; the maximal degree of transient population suppression; and the time taken for the system to reach maximum population suppression. For the KR system we consider the same metrics except there will be no equilibrium change in the population size since the system is self-limiting. In each case we run numerical simulations for each of the eight \\u03b1 values and repeat this for values of \\u03f5 (relative fitness) spanning the entire feasible range (i.e. 0 \\u2264 \\u03f5 \\u2264 1). Results obtained here indicate that no behavioural differences result from variation in the initial population size, so long as the release ratio is held constant (i.e. the absolute release size must be adjusted relative to the overall population).\\n\\nFrom the results of Fig 4 we identify a number of interesting features of the UD gene drive system. Firstly, similar to previous results for other classes of gene drive (e.g. [24, 30]) we find significant differences between systems that use early-acting as opposed to late-acting transgenes. Late-acting transgenes cause greater amounts of both maximal and equilibrium population suppression (\\u223c65% and \\u223c40%, respectively) than the early-acting system that produces just \\u223c5% and \\u223c4%, respectively when considering a 1:1 (introduced:wild) release ratio. However, we do not see any large differences in either the time taken to reach the maximal level of population suppression or the threshold fitness costs that produce lasting transgene introgression between the early and late acting systems. The region with no equilibrium population suppression below \\u03f5A = 0.88 = \\u03f5B is due to the elimination of the transgenes, but above this we see an amount of suppression that decreases as transgenic individuals become more fit (i.e. as \\u03f5A = \\u03f5B \\u2192 1).\\n\\nFor the KR system, the results in Fig 5 show that late-acting systems cause much greater levels of population suppression than early-acting ones. In particular, for the release ratio considered here (1:1, introduced:wild) we see that a late-acting system causes at most \\u223c65% population suppression whereas the early-acting system produces just \\u223c2.5%. We also observe a significantly different pattern of suppression as relative fitness varies. Unlike the UD system, here we observe sizeable differences in the time taken to reach the maximum level of population suppression. The early-acting system has a greatest time to maximal population suppression of \\u223c80 days whilst the late-acting system can take up to \\u223c70 days. We also observe a difference between early and late acting systems in terms of the relationship between relative fitness parameters and the time taken to reach maximal population suppression.\\n\\nThe differences observed here in levels of population suppression between early- and late-acting systems have been explained previously for other gene drive systems [24, 30]. For early-acting systems, fitness/lethal effects act to lower larval density, thereby reducing the density dependent competition experienced later and partially compensating for the effects of introduced transgenes. For late-acting systems, fitness/lethal effects act after density-dependent competition, providing an extra round of suppression that cannot be compensated for. Thus, late-acting systems produce a greater degree of population suppression.\\n\\nWhilst we observe significant differences in the degrees of population suppression caused by early- and late-acting UD and KR systems, we notice only tiny variations due to changing the initial population size. In particular, for each panel in Figs 4 and 5, some coloured symbols (representing results with different initial population sizes) display extremely small deviations from the grey lines (randomly chosen sample simulations). These deviations are likely to represent differences in numerical error between the eight examples, as explained in S1 Appendix Section 2, S1 and S2 Figs. This suggests that each system will produce consistent behaviour in terms of time scale, genotype frequencies and population suppression for any initial population size (see S3 Fig for time courses showing population size effects for the full range of relative fitness parameters studied here). We would expect this result to hold true so long as the population size is large enough to avoid stochastic and Allee effects (which are not included in this model).\\n\\nLaboratory and field studies have suggested that the larval stages of mosquito development may be subject to some degree of density-dependent competition [27, 28, 40\\u201348]. This often manifests itself as a reduction in the proportion of larvae that survive to adulthood in more densely packed environments [27, 42, 48]. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain why this may occur [28, 40, 49] yet, to our knowledge, none of these has yet been conclusively shown. Also subject to some degree of doubt is the strength of this density dependent effect. Some studies have suggested that mosquito populations are subject to only a very small density dependent effect [27], while others suggest that their dynamics may be strongly overcompensatory [46]. Since Alphey & Bonsall [24] demonstrated the potential for density dependent effects to result in oscillatory dynamics in the context of endonuclease-based gene drive systems, here we explore the potential range of behaviour that may occur as a result of varying the strength of density dependent larval competition in mosquito populations when either a UD or a KR system is introduced. While results are presented in Fig 6 for an Ae. aegypti population, we anticipate that similar results will also hold under alternative parameterisations representing other species.\\n\\nResults for each system under a range of different \\u03b2 parameter values are given in Fig 6. Transgene frequencies obtained for each of the numerical simulations here are given in S4 Fig (see S1 Appendix Eqs (S3) and (S4) for calculations). In these simulations it is assumed that each construct carries a fitness cost of 5% per construct (i.e. \\u03f5A = 0.95 = \\u03f5B); lethal genetic elements are strongly suppressed (i.e. one copy of the rescue element is sufficient); and the fitness/lethal effects are early-acting (i.e. prior to density dependent competition).\\n\\n\\nFig 6 shows that altering the strength of density dependence does not lead to any major differences in the outcomes of the considered control measures either in terms of which type of individuals are eliminated (wild-type or transgenic) or the time taken for this to occur. This final outcome differs for the two systems modelled. For the UD system each example results in lasting transgene introgression whereas, for the KR system, the rescue transgene frequency (see S1 Appendix Eq (S4)) increases to very similar levels before declining toward elimination in a similar time frame. Additionally, each of the three strengths of density dependence considered in Fig 6 result in approximately equal maximum transgene frequencies and times to transgene elimination for each system (see S4 Fig). However, it is clear that whilst density dependence does not play a significant role in deciding the outcome of a given control strategy, it does play a major role in determining the dynamics observed in reaching that outcome. For example, consistent with results in the literature we observe stable, damped oscillatory or persistent oscillatory behaviour for different \\u03b2 values (as seen in Fig 6) [24, 27]. However, here the \\u03b2 thresholds for each of these behaviours differ in value from those identified in other studies. This is likely due to differences between these studies in terms of the inclusion of a developmental delay (not included in Dye [27]) and the difference in the length of this delay between Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae (for Alphey & Bonsall [24]). For a more thorough stability analysis of this type of model see the Supplementary Information of Alphey & Bonsall [24].\\n\\nTo test the idea that the strength of density dependence does not affect the outcome of UD and KR gene drives further we compare thresholds for lasting transgene introgression (UD) and increases in the rescue frequency (KR) under differing strengths of density dependent competition (\\u03b2). Specifically, we discretise parameter space (release ratio (\\u03b8) and relative fitness (\\u03f5A = \\u03f5B)), simulate the model system under each parameter configuration and extract the relevant threshold. The results in Fig 7 show comparisons of five data sets in each case. These are from population genetics models [18] and four data sets from the population dynamics model described here. These represent the possible combinations of early or late acting fitness/lethal effects with weakly (\\u03b2 = 1.1) or intermediately (\\u03b2 = 2.5) overcompensatory density dependence. These particular \\u03b2 values are chosen so as to be different enough to produce an observable difference and yet avoid \\u03b2 values producing oscillatory behaviour.\\n\\n\\nFig 7 shows that the threshold lines from population genetics and population dynamics models lie extremely close together, suggesting that the strength of density dependence makes little or no difference to conditions for lasting transgene introgression (for UD) or increasing transgene frequency (for KR). Under a large degree of magnification (S11 Fig), small differences are visible, with increasing strength of density dependence having opposite effects on the two differing systems. For the UD system, increasing the strength of density dependence appears to very slightly raise the tolerable fitness costs conferred by transgenic constructs, however, for the KR system the same increase results in a very slight decrease in tolerable fitness costs. While this seems to imply a fundamental difference between the two systems, it is possible that this simply results from the necessity of using different criteria to define success in the two systems. The same results also demonstrate that, for a given strength of density dependence, the timing of the fitness/lethal effect appears to have little/no impact on the threshold lines displayed in Fig 7. The differences in tolerable fitness costs observed here are extremely small and so they are unlikely to materially alter the outcome of an implemented gene drive strategy. This is because any realistic gene drive release would likely aim to lie comfortably inside of the threshold lines of Fig 7 in order to ensure successful use [18].\\n\\nHere we consider the effects of various different model/system configurations (sexes released, strength of lethal suppression and sexes affected by lethal genes) on the potential outcomes from a released gene drive on both a target and a non-target population when there is migration between the two. This is examined using the two-deme population dynamics model summarised in the Methods section. Previous work focusing on population genetics models has shown that UD systems are unlikely to spread into a neighbouring population at any significant frequency since they are unlikely to exceed the necessary threshold introduction frequency [16, 17]. By contrast, the same studies have shown that KR systems are capable of reaching significant frequencies in neighbouring populations but that these will not persist due to the self-limiting nature of the system [16].\\n\\nPopulation genetics models have previously been used to study the migration of single-locus underdominant alleles and chromosome rearrangements [64\\u201366]. Further to this, the effects of different gene drive classes have also been studied with population genetics models [16, 17, 36, 67]. In terms of two-locus UD systems, Marshall [17] and Marshall & Hay [16] demonstrated that these systems display thresholds for fixation and loss of transgenes. Specifically, they find a threshold migration rate of 4.3% per generation is necessary for a UD system with additive fitness costs of 5% (dominance 50%) to invade a neighbouring population. For the same fitness costs, they also demonstrate that a migration rate of 1% per generation, produces near-fixation of transgenes in the target population and a maximum frequency of \\u223c3.2% in a neighbouring population. To our knowledge, these are the only studies considering migration of UD systems between two neighbouring populations. However, they do not consider the effects of migration in terms of its impact on either wild-type or total absolute population sizes. As such, here we discretise a region of parameter space (relative fitness and rate of migration) and simulate both classes of gene drive, measuring different outcomes relevant to the respective systems.\\n\\nAs in the previous section, the differing nature of the two systems considered necessitates the use of different measures to fully explore their behaviour. In the case of the UD system we record the total population size and number of wild-type females in both the target and non-target population at the new equilibrium. For the KR system we consider different measures since the system eventually returns to the original equilibrium. In particular, we record the maximum and minimum (i.e. most suppressed) population sizes; maximum and minimum (i.e. most suppressed) wild-type female population sizes; and the maximum frequency attained by the \\u2018rescue\\u2019 transgene (calculated as per S1 Appendix Eq (S4)). Here we consider just the number of wild-type female mosquitoes to be important since they are the only individuals capable of transmitting viruses (assuming cargo genes are fully effective in a single copy). We also consider total population sizes so as to ensure that, within the parameter range considered, transgenic mosquito releases will not significantly increase the total population size and thus the rate of nuisance biting (or potential transmission (by females) of other mosquito-borne diseases).\\n\\nWe identify three distinct outcomes for different parameter combinations in the UD system (summarised in Fig 8). Examples of these results obtained using the mathematical model presented here are given in S5\\u2013S8 Figs. These are given for each of the sixteen possible combinations of early or late-acting fitness/lethal effects, bisex or male-only release, bisex or female-specific lethals and strong or weak suppression of lethal genes. Additionally, S9 Fig gives results of typical numerical simulations demonstrating the composition of the final equilibria for each outcome.\\n\\nThe first possible outcome from Fig 8 (white area) is the undesirable scenario whereby the system cannot produce lasting transgene introgression in either population. This may occur because the introduced UD system fails to drive in the target population due to either high fitness costs or an insufficient release ratio. Another reason for this possibility is that the system could theoretically drive in the target population if isolated but may be prevented from doing so by an inward flow of wild-type individuals from the non-target population. This may be thought of as migration from the non-target population acting to lower the transgene frequency below the necessary threshold for lasting transgene introgression.\\n\\nA second possibility (black regions in Fig 8) is that the UD system achieves lasting and near-fixation transgene introgression in both the target and non-target populations. This may occur where transgenes confer only a small fitness cost to individuals carrying them. The rate of migration must then be sufficiently high to exceed the threshold transgene frequency in the neighbouring population yet not so high as to reduce the transgene frequency below the threshold before the system has a chance to establish itself in the target population. This is a potentially undesirable scenario since it would result in the spread of transgenes into non-target areas.\\n\\nFinally, it is possible that relatively small fitness costs and rates of migration (grey areas in Fig 8) may lead to an intermediate equilibrium in both the target and non-target populations. This is likely to be the desired outcome for the UD system since it produces stable, high frequency transgene presence in the target population with low transgene frequencies in the non-target population. With any degree of migration at all then, in this regime, it will not be possible to achieve complete eradication of wild-types from the target population nor a zero transgene frequency in the non-target population since the two populations constantly exchange individuals.\\n\\nThe final equilibrium attained in each of the systems considered here cannot be higher than the original equilibrium target or non-target population sizes. This is the case for both the overall population and that of wild-type females (as seen in S9 Fig). Thus we would not expect to observe any equilibrium increase in either the prevalence of a virus or the rate of nuisance biting within either population. However, there will be an initial rise in the total population size equal to the introduced transgenic mosquitoes.\\n\\nA direct comparison with the results of [16] and [17] is not straightforward. Specifically, here we study migration as a rate per day whereas previous models consider rates per generation. Additionally, [16] and [17] consider fitness costs to be additive whereas we assume they are multiplicative. It is unclear exactly how these differences will affect results, however S5\\u2013S9 Figs appear to find the same general pattern of outcomes as [16]. There are however a few significant differences between this work and previous studies. Specifically, our results demonstrate how each outcome would be expected to impact on both the target and non-target population sizes. This work also demonstrates that a range of different release scenarios and genetic systems not previously considered (S5\\u2013S8 Figs) would be expected to produce broadly the same pattern of outcomes although thresholds will vary case by case.\\n\\nComparing these results to those obtained using population dynamics models shows very similar results. There are, however, very small regions around threshold boundaries in which population suppression could prevent UD systems from spreading into a non-target neighbouring population. This is due to the fact that population suppression acts to lower the rate of transgenic migration out of the target population.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, results obtained for the KR system (Fig 9 and S10 Fig) under a 1:1 release ratio display a different pattern from those of the UD system. This is likely due to both the differing natures of the two systems and the measures used to assess them. However, as can be seen in Fig 7(c) and 7(d), the KR system does still display some threshold behaviour in that certain conditions on the release ratio and fitness costs of transgenic constructs must be met before the frequency of the rescue construct will increase (i.e. before the KR system will drive).\\n\\nIn particular, Fig 9 and S10(b) and S10(d) Fig show that whilst the maximum size of each population increases from introducing transgenic individuals, there is no increase in the number of adult wild-type female mosquitoes in either population. This holds for all genetic systems and release scenarios considered here, meaning that the introduction of a killer-rescue system would not be expected to result in an increased disease burden since only wild-type females are able to transmit pathogens (assuming cargo genes are fully effective in a single copy).\\n\\n\\nFig 9 and S10(a) and S10(c) Fig show that following the transient population increase, we observe some degree of transient suppression of both total and wild-type female population sizes due to the fitness costs and lethality of these systems. In particular, from (a) panels we see that bisex releases produce greater overall population suppression than male-only releases. We also see that bisex lethality produces a greater degree of overall population suppression than female-specific lethality. The strength of lethal suppression doesn\\u2019t produce significant differences. For wild-type female populations ((c) panels) we find that bisex releases also produce the greatest degree of population suppression. However, unlike overall population suppression, here we see that strong suppression of lethals produces a much greater effect on wild-type female population sizes than does weak suppression of lethals while bisex or female-specific lethality makes little difference.\\n\\nIn (e) panels of Fig 9 and S10 Fig we see the effects of migration on the maximum transgene frequency attained. In the target population, we see that only bisex releases of genetic systems with strongly suppressed lethals are capable of increasing in frequency for all rates of migration considered here. All other systems considered have a threshold migration rate above which they will not increase in frequency. This threshold migration rate is highest for cases with bisex releases. For male-only releases we find that strong suppression of lethals gives a higher migration threshold than does weak lethal suppression. For the non-target population we see that bisex releases produce greater transgene frequencies than male-only releases. Strong suppression of lethals also produces higher transgene frequencies than weak lethal suppression. For both the target and non-target populations, we observe little difference as a result of bisex versus female-specific lethality.\\n\\nEach of the results discussed above differ significantly from the case with no release of transgenic mosquitoes. Here the maximum and minimum total adult population sizes will be equal for both populations. The same will be true of the wild-type female populations and these will be exactly half of the total population. Assuming that the two populations are of equal size then the rate of migration will also have no impact on the size of either population.\\n\\nWithin this study we have formulated and analysed a flexible population dynamics model of UD and KR classes of gene drive. This produces results in agreement with the previous literature in terms of necessary introduction thresholds. This work investigated the effects of a number of important ecological factors on the equilibrium size of a mosquito population. Results presented here suggest that, all other things being equal, neither the size of a mosquito population nor the strength of density dependent larval competition will have a major bearing on the final outcome of UD or KR gene drives (assuming the release size is adjusted accordingly), however the density dependence significantly alters the dynamics observed in reaching that outcome. The model was then extended to consider the effects of migration between target and non-target mosquito populations, revealing three distinct outcomes for the UD system. Transgenes may either achieve lasting (near-fixation) introgression into both populations; be eliminated from both populations; or reach an intermediate equilibrium in each. Any of these outcomes may be viewed as desirable in certain circumstances; however the spatially limited drive achieved by the intermediate equilibrium scenario (high and low frequencies in the target and non-target populations, respectively) is traditionally viewed as success for the UD system. For a KR system the effects of migration are not so easily categorised, instead having a more continuous effect. Specifically, increased rates of migration lower the maximum transgene frequency in the target population and raise it in the non-target population. In combination these results suggest that the final outcomes of UD and KR systems are robust to a number of ecological factors and thus represent feasible strategies for replacement of mosquito populations and testing of cargo genes, respectively.\\n\\nPreviously, discrete generation population genetics models have been used to predict the key features/behaviours of UD and KR systems. Some ecological factors have been investigated for the systems studied here. In particular, for UD systems Huang et al. [19, 20] considered models with age and spatial structure. These studies consider a similar form of density dependence to that used here but their model structure considers the age (in days) of larvae and also allows competition between larvae of all ages. For the KR system, a great number of factors are incorporated in the highly complex Skeeter Buster [22] simulation model, however this does not easily allow the effects of each and their interactions to be disentangled. Here, the use of a simpler population dynamics model allows the effects of each ecological parameter to be more readily analysed. This work also examined the effects of differing release strategies (release ratios and sexes released) and genetic systems (sexes affected by lethals and strength of lethal suppression), previously considered for the UD system [18] but not for the KR system.\\n\\nThe models upon which this study is based have been successfully used in the study of alternative genetic control strategies (e.g. the sterile insect technique and mosquito control with homing endonuclease genes) and other pathogens (e.g. malaria) [23, 24]. Thus we expect the model given here may be adapted to represent other species, classes of gene drive, pathogens (e.g. lymphatic filariasis and Zika) and further ecological factors.\\n\\nAs with any modelling study, this work is based upon a number of simplifying assumptions, each of which is common and have been discussed in previous works of a similar type [8, 15, 18, 23, 24]. Thus we do not discuss them any further here. There are however a number of areas in which future work may help to refine our understanding of gene drive efficacy.\\n\\nHere we consider a fixed time delay as a simple form of age structuring representing the developmental time between egg laying and emergence as adults. As a consequence of studying models such as this, it is implicitly assumed that density dependent competition occurs only between larvae born at the same time. Thus, future work could look to incorporate formalised age structuring (e.g. that of Huang et al. [20]) into a model similar to that studied here. This may also allow us to more precisely evaluate the effects of different timings of transgene fitness costs/lethality. It would also be interesting to compare results given here to those from a model such as that of Huang et al. [20] to see whether the oscillatory behaviour seen in Fig 6 is still feasible.\\n\\nThe models investigated here implicitly assume that adult individuals mate each day and do not store sperm across days. This is a limitation of applying this type of model to mosquito populations. Future work may therefore seek to explore the effects of including more realistic assumptions on the mating behaviours of adult mosquito populations.\\n\\nThe two-deme model formulation used here represents two mosquito populations as each panmictic with no internal spatial structure; essentially as entities existing at single points in space. Future extensions could thus seek to incorporate spatially structured mosquito populations to explore how mosquito behaviour could affect gene drive efficacy.\\n\\nThroughout this study we assume the absence of mutations and resistance. At present, the probability of these factors occurring is unclear and may only be characterised through long term experiments. However, the techniques of Marshall [50] would allow the effects of transgene separation to be explored theoretically.\\n\\nWe assume that the introduction of UD or KR gene drives associated with a refractory \\u201ccargo\\u201d gene at a sufficiently high allele frequency in a vector population would reduce disease transmission. An extension of this model that considers human populations and epidemiology would allow this effect to be quantified.\\n\\nIn this work we assumed that the size of each mosquito population is known, such that releases can be made at a predetermined ratio to that number. In practice, the accurate measurement of wild mosquito population sizes is a major technical challenge and one that must be overcome in order to ensure that any releases of UD or KR carrying mosquitoes will have their desired effect.\\n\\nA key feature of UD and KR gene drives is that they are not predicted to eliminate targeted populations and can therefore potentially disrupt pathogen transmission without leaving a vacant ecological niche into which another species may spread. However, results presented here and in the previous literature have shown that various classes of gene drive can produce a transient phase in which a targeted population may be heavily suppressed (e.g. UD, KR and Wolbachia [51, 52]). Since Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus are known to compete [53\\u201355] it is possible that the successful implementation of UD and KR gene drives could lead an existing Ae. aegypti population to be displaced by Ae. albopictus where it would not otherwise have been. This would likely hamper efforts to eliminate viruses such as dengue since Ae. albopictus are also competent vectors [56]. Such competition has been studied in the context of SIT/RIDL control [57] but has not yet been extended to consider classes of gene drive.\\n\\nThis work has demonstrated the feasibility of mosquito control using either UD or KR gene drive systems. In addition to further refining the relationship between specific designs, release strategies and fitness regimes in terms of the constraints they impose on the thresholds for desired outcomes to emerge, this work also helps to elucidate the impacts of a number of ecological factors. Whilst this study should be useful for scientists and regulators when examining/designing UD and KR gene drive systems, further modelling and experimental work would likely help to further refine our understanding of such systems and how they may help in the control of mosquito-borne diseases.\\n\",\n          \"Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by a profound depletion of CD4+ T cell numbers and function. Immune restoration with combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) has substantially improved patients' outcomes. Unfortunately, this restoration may be delayed, notably in patients starting treatment late, and/or incomplete, despite control of the viral replication [1]. Hence, immune therapy may be a complementary intervention to accelerate or improve immune restoration. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine produced by non\\u2013marrow-derived stromal and epithelial cells and is required for the development and persistence of T cells in the periphery [2], [3]. IL-7 may enhance thymopoiesis [4]\\u2013[6], as well as thymic-independent peripheral proliferation of recent thymic emigrants [7]\\u2013[9] and of more mature T cells [7], [9] even in the absence of cognate antigen [9]\\u2013[11]. Improved cell survival has also been shown in vivo [11]\\u2013[15]. In HIV-infected patients, a strong inverse correlation has been observed between plasma IL-7 levels and CD4+ T cell numbers as well as with CD4+ T cell reconstitution after initiation of antiretroviral therapy [16], [17]\\u2013[19]. Increased levels of IL-7 during lymphopenia are thought to be mainly the consequence of a decreased receptor-mediated clearance of IL-7 as the availability of receptors diminishes [20]. In addition, the IL-7 signaling on IL-7 receptor-a-positive (IL-7Ra+) dendritic cells in lymphopenic settings may diminish the homeostatic proliferation of CD4+ T cells [21]. A recent study has suggested that the remaining chronic inflammation in treated HIV-infected patients due to exposure to IL-1\\u03b2 and IL-6 may decrease T-cell sensitivity to IL-7 and therefore a reduced CD4+ T cell reconstitution [22]. Recent analyses of lymph node tissues have shown that collagen deposition may restrict T-cell access to IL-7, resulting in apoptosis and depletion of T cells [23]. This in turn leads to decreased production of lymphotoxin B, a trophic factor for reticuloendothelial cells, leading to their demise and loss of IL-7 producing cells. In summary, the IL-7 effect on CD4+ T-cell homeostasis is highly compromised in HIV infection [24].\\n\\nThe beneficial effect of administration of IL-7 on T cell homeostasis in patients with refractory cancer [9], in SIV infected macaques [15], [25], [26] and HIV infected individuals has been shown through several early trials [27], [28] and observational studies [29]. However, before proceeding with phase II and III trials, several questions remain. From a mechanistic standpoint, the respective contributions of thymic production [9], peripheral proliferation and survival [11] in the observed increase of CD4+ T cell count in HIV-infected patients are unclear. Also, the schedule of IL-7 administration, notably the frequency of cycling needed to reach optimal and durable CD4+ T cell restoration is not defined. Finally, the long-term effects of IL-7 therapy and repeated IL-7 cycles on T cell homeostasis in HIV-infected patients are unknown. To address these questions, we have developed a mathematical model to approximate the effect of IL-7 on CD4+ T cell homeostasis to fit the data from two phase I trials of IL-7 intervention in HIV-infected patients. This analysis is most consistent with a significant additional biological effect (on cell survival and/or thymic production) to the observed transient increase in peripheral cell proliferation. The predictions from the model have been used to explore the feasibility of repeated \\u201cmaintenance\\u201d cycles of IL-7 administration with the aim of maintaining a given level of circulating CD4+ T cells.\\n\\nChronically HIV-1 infected patients with CD4+ T cell counts between 100 and 400 cells/\\u00b5L and plasma HIV RNA<50 copies (c)/mL while on antiretroviral therapy were studied in three phase I/II trials (see Methods and Table 1 for characteristics). In Study I and II, there was a dose-dependent increase of CD4+ T cell count peaking between 14 and 21 days after the initial injection and followed by a steady decline. The peak increase ranged between 152 and 1202 CD4+ T cells/\\u00b5L in the two studies [28], [30]. A significant increase compared to baseline (and placebo group in Study II) persisted until 12 weeks in the first study (Figure S1) and 52 weeks in the second (Figure 1). The main contributors to CD4+ T cell increase were naive and central memory cells [28], [30]. There was a transient increase of Ki67 expression (a marker of proliferation; see Methods) in all CD4+ T cell subsets during IL-7 administration (Figure 2). The peak of Ki67 expression was observed at the first available measurement after the initiation of IL-7 therapy, which is 14 days in study I and 7 days in study II. At 28 days, Ki67 expression returned to baseline in both studies.\\n\\nThis increase in cell proliferation, observed in parallel with the increase in CD4+ T cells, might be the only significant effect in vivo of the injection of exogenous IL-7. Indeed, IL-7 induces an acute cellular proliferation during a short time period leading to a rapid CD4+ T cell increase, followed by a slow return to baseline levels as CD4+ T cells die, explaining the observed dynamics. However, additional effects, especially on thymic output or cell survival, might exist and slow down the decline of CD4+ T cells. Recent thymic emigrants (defined as CD45RA+CD31high) and the sj/\\u03b2 T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) ratio (in Study II), which are both an indirect measure of thymic output [31], are significantly increased after IL-7 injections [28], [30]. In Study II, we also observed a decrease in PD-1 expression (a marker of cell exhaustion) by CD4+ T cells [30] suggesting an increased cell survival. Although these observations gave some insight in potential effects of IL-7 on T cell homeostasis, they do not quantify the respective contribution of these mechanisms to the observed CD4+ T cell dynamics in blood in terms of input and output of cells. This is why we embarked on a mathematical analysis to test whether the observed peripheral proliferation could explain the CD4+ T cell dynamics after IL-7 injections or if other additional biological mechanism played a significant role.\\n\\nWe used a simple mathematical model to investigate mechanistically the effect of IL-7 on total CD4+ and naive CD4+ T-cell dynamics (see Methods and Figure S2). Modeling CD4+ dynamics and Ki67+ expression by changing the proliferation rate during IL-7 administration provided a fair fit of the data of study II (Figure 3A, plain lines). Interestingly, there was a significant linear increase of estimated proliferation rates according to the dose group (p<0.0001; Figure 4A and 4B). However, we found a better fit of CD4+ dynamics with Model 2 (LCVa \\u22120.173 vs. 0.937; Figure 3A, dashed lines) that includes an effect of IL-7 on proliferation rate during IL-7 administration and on loss rate after IL-7 administration. In addition to the significant dose-dependent increase of proliferation during IL-7, we estimated a decrease of the loss rate of quiescent cells from 0.061 to 0.044\\u20130.049 per day corresponding to an improvement of the life span of about 25% from 16.4 days to 20.4\\u201322.7 days (likelihood ratio test p-value<0.001; Figure 4, Table 2 and Table S1). This result was found with both formulation of IL-7 (with either rh-IL-7 or glycosylated rh-IL7; Table S2). Adding a modification of the constant production of CD4+ (Model 3) rather than a modification of loss rate (Model 2) did not substantially improve the fit to total CD4+ T cell dynamics as shown in Figure 3A where the fits from the two models overlap (see also Figure S3 and S4). In other words, although the Model 2 that includes a modification of quiescent cell loss rate was better from a statistical point of view (LCVa\\u200a=\\u200a\\u22120.131 vs. \\u22120.173), it was difficult to distinguish the fits of the two models. Interestingly, all models described correctly the initial increase of CD4+ T cells and thereafter, Model 1 predicted a slower decline of CD4+ T cells than Model 2 and 3. This poorer long-term fit might be explained by a transient effect on the proliferation rate (until day 16) that altered only briefly the equilibrium while the lingering effect on the production or loss rate changed it in the long-term.\\n\\nTo further analyze the potential effect of IL-7 on thymic output, we explored the effect of IL-7 on the naive (CD45RA+CD27+) CD4+ cells (either Ki67+ or Ki67\\u2212) using the available data for this subset (until 12 weeks). Here again, we found that an additional effect of IL-7 after its administration either on the thymic production or the loss rate significantly improves the fits compared to a model including only an effect on the proliferation rate (Table S3). Interestingly, we found that the best model was the one including an effect on the thymic production rate of naive cells after IL-7 administration in addition to the proliferation rate (LCVa\\u200a=\\u200a1.705 vs. 1.760 for the model including an effect on the loss rate after IL-7 administration; Table 2 and Table S3). Both models including an additional effect of IL-7 were better than the model with an effect on proliferation only (LCVa\\u200a=\\u200a1.832). However, a change in loss rate of quiescent cells led to a good fit as well and individual fits from Model 2 and 3 were very close as shown in Figure 3B and S5.\\n\\nFinally, we were interested in the ability of Model 2 (with the effect of IL-7 on proliferation and loss rates) to predict individual responses to IL-7. We made use of data from 12 additional patients (from INSPIRE 2, Table 1) treated with a 20 \\u00b5g/kg dose as per the INSPIRE study. We used only the first two measurements of total CD4+ T cells and Ki67+ cells to compute the Empirical Bayes estimates for each parameter that could vary between patients. The other population parameters were fixed according to the previous estimations (Table S1). We then predicted the individual CD4+ T cell dynamics until week 12. Most of the observed total CD4+ T cell counts were in the prediction interval (Figure S6). Therefore, the model that includes an effect of IL-7 on proliferation and loss rates led to a good description of the total CD4+ T cell dynamics and a fair predictive ability at the individual level.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, no data exists yet on the effect of repeated cycles of IL-7 in vivo. Therefore, to investigate to what extent IL-7 administration might sustain CD4+ T-cell restoration, we artificially created data and compared different scenarios allowing the IL-7 effect to wane after subsequent injections compared to the initial one (see Methods). In this part, we considered an extended version of the mathematical model that incorporates a homeostatic proliferation (see Methods). This model gave similar results as presented in the previous section (not shown) but more realistic long-term dynamics for repeated IL-7 administrations (total CD4+ T cell counts staying below 1500 cells/\\u00b5L).\\n\\nAs the dose 20 \\u00b5g/Kg was the one recommended for further phase II/III studies [30], we simulated CD4+ T cell dynamics with hypothetical repeated cycles of IL-7 administration for each patient who received this dose in the Study I (INSPIRE): namely 14 patients. The parameter \\u03ba controlling the proliferation rate was fixed to the same value for each patient (see Methods). The initial CD4+ dynamics was the one predicted by the Model 2 as presented in the previous section. CD4+ T cell count were assumed to be measured every three months and when it dropped below 500 cells/\\u00b5L a cycle of IL-7 administration was simulated (one injection per week for 3 weeks). The dynamics were therefore based in part on fit to observed data and in part on a predicted response to repeated therapy. We analyzed two primary outcomes: the time spent above 500 cells/\\u00b5L and the number of cycles (including the first cycle) needed to maintain CD4+ T cell counts above 500 cells/\\u00b5L over 2 years. A secondary outcome was the median time between two successive cycles.\\n\\nSimulations were performed according to several scenarios varying from a constant effect after each cycle and decreasing effects on loss and proliferation rates. At each cycle, we assumed that the effect of IL-7 on the loss rate of CD4+ T cells started to decrease 3 (or 9) months after the last injection and disappeared after 1 (or 2) year. Table S3 shows some scenarios ordered from the best to the worst according to the primary outcomes. Where all the IL-7 cycles were assumed to keep 100% of their effects on CD4+ T cell counts (Scenario A-1 and A-2; Figure 5A and Table S4), the intervention was highly effective. CD4+ T cell counts were maintained above 500 cells/\\u00b5L between 84% and 91% of the time compared to 11.5% when no new IL-7 cycle was administrated during the 24 months of follow-up. Moreover, the time between two cycles of IL-7 was estimated to be greater than 6 months. We also investigated reduced effect of IL-7 on peripheral proliferation and/or loss rate of non-proliferating cells during subsequent cycles. The scenario assuming that during repeated cycles only 50% of the effect on proliferation was effective while the effect on the loss rate was conserved (scenario B-1 and B-2; Figure 5B and Table S4) gave similar results as the scenario assuming a full and constant effect of proliferation and loss rate (Scenario A-1 and A-2; Table S4). Moreover, we observed that the more the effect of IL-7 on the loss rate was reduced, the more often cycles have to be administrated and the shorter the time between two successive cycles (Figure S7). These results suggest that it is more important to keep a strong effect on the loss rate of non-proliferating cells than on proliferation. As shown in Figure S7, when the effect of IL-7 is only maintained on the proliferation rate (i.e. no more effect in the loss rate of non-proliferating cells: \\u03b1\\u03bcQ\\u200a=\\u200a0), we predicted the highest number of injections, whatever the size of the effect on the proliferation rate, to sustain CD4 count above 500 cells/\\u00b5L. Overall, in comparison to no repeated cycle (Reference scenario in Table S4) whatever the assumed effect of IL-7 during successive cycles, the CD4+ T cell count may be durably increased with clinically realistic administration schedules. Therefore, IL-7 repeated cycles seems feasible and efficient.\\n\\nWe report here a mathematical analysis of total and naive CD4+ T cell dynamics in HIV-1 infected patients treated with antiretrovirals who experienced a significant increase of CD4+ T cell counts while receiving IL-7 therapy. We confirm, once again, that IL-7 induces a significantly increased peripheral proliferation of CD4+ T cells as measured by Ki67 expression. However, results presented here extend our knowledge on the in vivo effects of IL-7 by showing that this increased peripheral proliferation alone could not explain the long-term changes in CD4+ T cell number that were observed. An increase of the production rate of naive CD4+ T cells and a decrease of the loss rate for total CD4+ T cells might also contribute to T-cell homeostasis during IL-7 therapy. Importantly, baseline parameters such as naive T cell production (around 9\\u00d7108 naive cells/day) [32], loss rate of proliferating cells (0.08 day\\u22121) [33] or reversion rate (accounting for duration of division and duration of Ki67+ expression) were in agreement with current knowledge. Furthermore, our mathematical model shows good performance for individual predictions and provides insights on the feasibility of repeated cycles of IL-7 (or long-lasting formulation) for maintaining CD4+ T cell counts in HIV-infected patients. Predictions from the mathematical model underline the importance of an additional effect of IL-7 beyond peripheral cell proliferation for long-term CD4+ T cell responses.\\n\\nHIV infection leads to a profound disturbance of T cell homeostasis with an increased turnover of these cells [33]\\u2013[35]. The naive T cell pool is replenished mainly by post-thymic proliferation in adults [36], [37] but the observed proliferation of naive CD4+ T cells is not enough to prevent the slow decline of these cells in HIV infected patients. Augmenting immunity with exogeneous cytokines has been attempted in HIV infection; and although CD4 T cell numbers were increased with administration of IL-2, two large clinical trials failed to show any evidence of clinical benefit [38]. The failure of IL-2 therapy to confer clinical benefit despite CD4 T cell increases could be attributed at least in part to the regulatory phenotype of the expanded cells [39] and the possibility of enhanced inflammation and coagulation during administration [40]. The effects of IL-7 on the other hand are fundamentally different [13] and the defined role of IL-7 in maintaining T cell homeostasis in health provides rationale for testing its therapeutic administration in HIV infection complicated by immune failure [41].\\n\\nOur data argue for an increase in cell survival after IL-7 administration. Our results show that CD4+ T cell dynamics are better explained by a decrease of cell loss in addition to the transient peripheral proliferation. This finding is consistent with previous findings that increasing cellular survival through up-regulation of bcl2 expression is a physiological function of IL-7 [13], [42]. Moreover, increases in T cell survival after IL-7 injection have been demonstrated in monkeys using BrdU labeling [15]. Our findings warrant further study to define the precise mechanisms of IL-7 induced cell expansion in HIV infection.\\n\\nImprovement of thymopoiesis has been reported during exogenous IL-7 administration [5], [6]. However, there is some controversy on the importance of this effect in vivo [9], [43]. Sportes et al. showed a modest increase of absolute numbers of TRECs and a major dilution of TREC content due to peripheral cell proliferation leading to the conclusion that the increase of TCR repertoire diversity is mainly due to the proliferation of recent thymic emigrants. The effects of IL-7 on thymopoiesis may be dependent, on one hand, on the underlying disease (HIV-1 infection, cancer and chemotherapy) and, on the other hand, on the duration of cytokine therapy [9]. In our simulations of repeated IL-7 cycles, we did not consider any effect of IL-7 on thymopoiesis because we favoured the hypothesis of an effect on cell survival according to the rationale above and the slightly better fit. Therefore, if IL-7 administration improved thymopoiesis in addition to peripheral proliferation and enhanced cell survival, the CD4+ T cell response should have surpassed our predictions.\\n\\nFor long-term predictions using simulations, the initial model was extended by adding a homeostatic control of proliferation after IL-7 administration. This can be related to the modulation of IL7Ra expression that prevents uncontrolled proliferation [44], [45]. Furthermore, the effect on T cell loss was also modeled to wane over time. Strikingly, the estimation of the duration of the effect of IL-7 on cell survival was prolonged up to 2 years. Likely, this could not be explained by the pharmacokinetics of exogenous IL-7 that was administrated during two weeks only. However, exogenous IL-7 is known to bind to components of the extracellular matrix resulting in saturation of this tissue compartment followed by a slow release of IL-7, which may exert long-lasting effects [3]. Also, IL-7 could have persistent effects on cellular homeostasis by normalizing tissue architecture through decreasing fibrosis in the gut [46] and in lymph nodes [23], [47], [48], [49] and thus improving cellular access to survival signals. Other potential activities such as effects on cell trafficking [27], [50], IL-7 antibody formation, switch to memory phenotypes [14], [51] or impact on proviral HIV DNA content [52] have not been taken into account in this model. Redistribution of CD4+ T cells to tissues, leading to a transient decrease of CD4+ T cells levels in blood, is mainly observed in the first days after IL-7 administration and should not affect measurements made thereafter. Although neutralizing anti-IL-7 antibodies were not observed in patients following the first cycle of IL-7 [28], their induction after repeated administration could attenuate the effects that we modeled here. For these reasons, new clinical trials are needed to help distinguishing the persistent IL-7 effect(s) involved in CD4 recovery in HIV-infected patients and to propose personalized therapy in the future [53]. Furthermore, we assumed repetition of cycles (i.e. three injections over two weeks) but the repetition of single injections could lead to similar results shown in the simulations if the effect of one injection respect the assumptions made in some scenarios. For instance, the repetition of a single injection may have a reduced effect on proliferation and cell survival compared to a whole cycle but this would still lead to a good maintenance of CD4+ T cell counts.\\n\\nThere are limitations to this study that include the restricted number of harvest times and the lack of validated markers for cellular lifespan. One way to overcome these limitations and to help distinguishing between increased production and increased survival is to perform studies that include in vivo labeling with deuterium and TREC content measurements. Indeed, deuterium labeling is a recent and powerful tool to estimate cell turnover [54] and used in combination with TREC content allows estimation of thymic output [37], [55]. Also, it may have been relevant to distinguish the dynamics in lymph node tissue to better capture long-term effect of IL-7 although data on lymph node tissue would be difficult to obtain. Despite these caveats, the goodness of fit and the predictive capacity of the model provide important insights for further development of IL-7 treatment strategies. We have learned that IL-7 administration leads to a burst of peripheral proliferation that is likely associated with a lingering effect beyond the period of IL-7 administration. We surmise that a durable effect of IL-7 on T cell homeostasis could be achieved after repeated administration but safety and activity need to be confirmed [2], [3].\\n\\nData were generated in three phase I/II studies (Table 1). All participating institute's Institutional Review Boards approved the studies and the procedures and all participants provided written informed consent before study participation. The rh-IL-7 study (referred to as Study I) [28] evaluated Recombinant Human Interleukin 7 (rh-IL-7), a nonglycosylated protein composed of 153 amino acids, and included 14 HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy whose CD4+ T cell counts were between 100 and 400 cells/\\u00b5l and whose plasma HIV RNA levels were less than 50 copies/ml. Patients received a total of 8 subcutaneous injections of 2 different doses of recombinant human IL-7 (3 or 10 \\u00b5g/kg, dose 1 and 2, respectively) 3 times per week over a 16-day period. Eleven repeated measurements of total CD4+ T cells up to 48 weeks and four measurements of Ki67+ positive T cells among CD4+ T cells up to 12 weeks were performed.\\n\\nThe INSPIRE Study (referred to as Study II) [30] evaluated 3 weekly subcutaneous (SC) injections of a purified glycosylated 152 amino acid rhIL-7 (CYT107 over a period of 2 weeks). Three doses were tested: 10, 20 and 30 \\u00b5g/Kg/week. Seven, 8 and 6 patients received three injections (one per week) in each dose group, respectively. Two HIV-infected patients were randomized per dose level and received a placebo (NaCl). Visits for safety and immunologic evaluation were performed at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, week 9 and week 12 and then quarterly up to week 52. In the INSPIRE 2 Study (referred to as Study III), 12 patients received 3 subcutaneous injection of 20 \\u00b5g/Kg/week CYT107 (one per week over 2 weeks) and were followed up to week 52.\\n\\nAbsolute CD4 T-cell counts, T cell expression of Ki67, and the proportions of naive subsets defined by expression of CD45RA and CD27 (naive: CD45RA+CD27+) were measured in whole blood by flow cytometric assays within 6 hours of blood draw in the Rh-IL7 study [28]. In INSPIRE, naive cells in cryopreserved samples were identified by expression of CD45RA, CD27 and CCR7; in INSPIRE 2 naive cells were enumerated in cryopreserved PBMC by expression of CD45RA and CCR7.\\n\\nKi67 is a cellular marker of proliferation [56] and is associated with cell proliferation. It is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (namely G1, S, G2 and M) and it is absent from resting cells (phase G0). Therefore, some of the cells expressing Ki67 are actually in the division phase M and the rest are \\u201con their way\\u201d to this phase or very recently in this phase. In this model, we assume that proliferating cells express Ki67 whereas non-proliferating (i.e. resting) cells do not; this is a relatively good approximation. We consider the following mathematical model including two populations of cells (see Figure S2 for a general cartoon of the model): non-proliferating cells (Ki67\\u2212, denoted Q) and proliferating cells (Ki67+, denoted P):\\n\\nNon-proliferating cells (Q) are produced at a constant rate \\u03bb. They become Ki67+ at rate \\u03c0 and die at rate \\u03bcQ. Proliferating cells (P) die at rate \\u03bcp and lose their proliferation marker Ki67 at rate \\u03c1 (cells express Ki67 for 1/\\u03c1 days). We assumed that 2\\u03c1P cells enter the Q compartment that is two daughter cells are produced after one single cell cycle. The loss rates (\\u03bcP and \\u03bcQ) are influenced by cell survival but also by any redistribution between blood and other tissues. Before the first injection at t\\u200a=\\u200a0, both populations are assumed to be at equilibrium (i.e.  and ). This model was used for total CD4+ T-cells where Q and P include both naive and memory CD4+ T-cells. Similarly, we used this general model to describe naive CD4+ T-cell dynamics adding a superscript \\u2018N\\u2019 to all parameters (\\u03bbN, \\u03c0N, \\u03bcQN, \\u03bcPN, \\u03c1N) and where QN represent non-proliferating naive CD4+ T-cells and PN proliferating naive CD4+ T-cells.\\n\\nTo model the effect of IL-7, we considered different models allowing some parameters to change over time (i.e. during or after the IL-7 administration). We distinguished three models:\\n\\nModel 1 includes only an effect on the proliferation rate \\u03c0 during the IL-7 administration\\n\\nModel 2 includes an effect on \\u03c0 and an additional effect on the loss rate of non-proliferation cells \\u03bcQ (effect tested during or after the IL-7 administration)\\n\\nModel 3 includes an effect on \\u03c0 and an additional effect on the production rate \\u03bb (effect tested during or after the IL-7 administration).\\n\\nModels including an effect of IL-7 on the duration of Ki67 expression or on a direct production of Ki67+ cells from the thymus were also tried but did not improve the fit of the data (not shown).\\n\\nEach parameter is assumed equal to a baseline value (denoted \\u03c00, \\u03bcQ0, \\u03bb0) and we tested a possible effect of IL-7 and a possible dose effect. For instance, the proliferation rate \\u03c0 was assumed equal to  before (t\\u200a=\\u200a0) and after IL-7 administration (t>\\u03c4) and to  during IL-7 administration (0<t\\u2264\\u03c4). The variable trt indicates if an individual received the placebo (trt\\u200a=\\u200a0) or IL-7 injections (trt\\u200a=\\u200a1), hence the parameter \\u03b70 represents the possible effect of IL-7 on the parameter \\u03c0. Similarly, we tested a possible dose effect via the parameter \\u03b71 and the variable dose; dose\\u200a=\\u200a0 if the individual received the placebo and 0.3, 1, 2 or 3 according to the received dose of IL-7. The additional dose effect is here assumed to be linear: the dose 30 \\u00b5g/Kg will have 3 times more effect than the dose 10 \\u00b5g/Kg and 10 times more than the dose 3 \\u00b5g/Kg. The time \\u03c4 (time of IL-7 effect on the proliferation rate \\u03c0) was fixed to 16 days and robustness analyses with values between 14 and 16 days have been performed leading to similar results but slightly worse likelihood (not shown).\\n\\nFor the simulations of repeated administrations of IL-7, a homeostatic control of proliferation was incorporated in order to constrain the CD4+ T cell level in a credible range (below 1500 cells/\\u00b5L). The newly defined rate of proliferation, denoted \\u03c0*, is defined as follows:where N0 is the baseline CD4 T cell count, Nt is CD4 T cell count at time t and \\u03ba is a number lower than 1 estimated on the data. As N0 is relatively low due to lymphopenia, cells will be allowed to proliferate more while the circulating number of CD4+ T cells is still relatively low but as soon as this number deviates too much from the baseline value the proliferation rate is reduced [57]. Several formulations have been tested, including one with Nmax\\u200a=\\u200a1000 referring to a normal healthy value rather than N0 and all formulations led to similar conclusions due to different estimates of the parameter \\u03ba (not shown). The parameter \\u03ba was estimated by profile likelihood because it was difficult to estimate it at the same time as the other parameters. The parameter \\u03ba was therefore fixed at different plausible values and the model was estimated for each value of \\u03ba and we kept the value of \\u03ba for which the model had the lowest likelihood.\\n\\nHere, we only considered Model 2 including the effect of IL-7 on the proliferation rate and the loss rate of non-proliferating cells as it was the best model according to real data. Moreover, in this model, the loss rate of non-proliferating cell (\\u03bcQ) was assumed decreased (to a constant value) after day 16 and during (Tfull-16) days after the injection and then linearly increased to its baseline value after Tend days (see Figure S2). As subsequent cycles of IL-7 might have reduced effects compared to the first one, the proliferation rate (resp. loss rate) of the subsequent cycle is denoted by \\u03c0sub (resp. \\u03bcQsub) and keep \\u03c0 (resp. \\u03bcQ) for the first injection. These rates are defined as \\u03c0sub\\u200a=\\u200a\\u03b1\\u03c0\\u03c0 and \\u03bcQsub\\u200a=\\u200a\\u03b1\\u03bcQ\\u03bcQ, where \\u03b1\\u03c0 and \\u03b1\\u03bcQ represent the strength of new IL-7 administration (i.e. the percentage of effect of \\u03c0sub and \\u03bcQsub compared to the initial injection). Therefore, we assumed for all subsequent cycles a similar reduction of IL-7 effects compared to the first cycle.\\n\\nParameters were estimated using maximum penalized likelihood that takes into account unbalanced data due to sparse missing values and the availability of Ki67+ staining up to week 12 (no measurements were available beyond that time). This method can be viewed either as a version of maximum likelihood allowing taking into account prior knowledge (from previous estimates found in published studies), or as an approximation of Bayesian inference [58], [59].\\n\\nThe Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) system was solved with dsolve from the ODEPACK [60] for stiff system using Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods (the Gear methods). Each parameter (\\u03b8i) was modeled as the sum of a population (fixed) parameter (\\u03b2) and a random effect (bi) allowing the parameter to be different from one patient to another:  Each random effect was assumed to be normally distributed with a variance to be estimated: . A stepwise selection procedure was used and when the variance of a given random effect was not significant, the parameter was considered as fixed in the next model. We observe the number of proliferating cells (P) and the total number of cells (P+Q) plus a measurement error adding two unknown parameters  and . The final models included only two random effects, one for \\u03bb (production rate) and one for \\u03c1 (the rate at which proliferating cells go back to rest). The best model was selected using an approximation of the likelihood cross-validation criterion (LCVa, [58], [59]) that is based on the likelihood weighted by the number of parameters estimated like the Akaike Criteria (AIC). The lower is the value of the criteria the better is the model. Individual predicted trajectories were computed using the Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) for all parameters having a random effect [61].\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Gaining a deeper understanding of host pathways exploited by henipaviruses for infection may identify targets for new anti-viral therapies. Here we have performed genome-wide high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection. miR-181 also promoted Nipah virus infection, but did not affect infection by paramyxoviruses from other genera, indicating specificity in the virus-host interaction. Infection promotion was primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to significantly enhance henipavirus-induced membrane fusion. Cell signalling receptors of ephrins, namely EphA5 and EphA7, were identified as novel negative regulators of henipavirus fusion. The expression of these receptors, as well as EphB4, were suppressed by miR-181 overexpression, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of several Ephs by the miRNA contributes to enhanced infection and fusion. Immune-responsive miR-181 levels was also up-regulated in the biofluids of ferrets and horses infected with Hendra virus, suggesting that the host innate immune response may promote henipavirus spread and exacerbate disease severity. This study is the first genome-wide screen of miRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus and nominates select miRNAs as targets for future anti-viral therapy development.\\n\",\n          \"A number of different genetics-based vector control methods have been proposed. Two approaches currently under development in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the two-locus engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drive systems. Each of these is theoretically capable of increasing in frequency within a population, thus spreading associated desirable genetic traits. Thus they have gained attention for their potential to aid in the fight against various mosquito-vectored diseases. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. it is self-sustaining) whilst in the killer-rescue system the rescue component should initially increase in frequency (while the lethal component (killer) is common) before eventually declining (when the killer is rare) and being eliminated (i.e. it is temporally self-limiting). The population genetics of both systems have been explored using discrete generation mathematical models. The effects of various ecological factors on these two systems have also been considered using alternative modelling methodologies. Here we formulate and analyse new mathematical models combining the population dynamics and population genetics of these two classes of gene drive that incorporate ecological factors not previously studied and are simple enough to allow the effects of each to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on the potential effects that may be obtained as a result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; and the relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also extend our models to consider population dynamics in two demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal between neighbouring populations on the outcome of UD and KR gene drive systems.\\n\",\n          \"Exogenous Interleukin-7 (IL-7), in supplement to antiretroviral therapy, leads to a substantial increase of all CD4+ T cell subsets in HIV-1 infected patients. However, the quantitative contribution of the several potential mechanisms of action of IL-7 is unknown. We have performed a mathematical analysis of repeated measurements of total and naive CD4+ T cells and their Ki67 expression from HIV-1 infected patients involved in three phase I/II studies (N\\u200a=\\u200a53 patients). We show that, besides a transient increase of peripheral proliferation, IL-7 exerts additional effects that play a significant role in CD4+ T cell dynamics up to 52 weeks. A decrease of the loss rate of the total CD4+ T cell is the most probable explanation. If this effect could be maintained during repeated administration of IL-7, our simulation study shows that such a strategy may allow maintaining CD4+ T cell counts above 500 cells/\\u00b5L with 4 cycles or fewer over a period of two years. This in-depth analysis of clinical data revealed the potential for IL-7 to achieve sustained CD4+ T cell restoration with limited IL-7 exposure in HIV-1 infected patients with immune failure despite antiretroviral therapy.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"plain language summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The henipaviruses Hendra and Nipah are bat-borne paramyxoviruses that are highly pathogenic in humans. Until recently the constraints of working at biosafety level 4 had hindered the large scale study of host factors associated with henipavirus infection. MicroRNAs are a class of single-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate biological processes in eukaryotes. An emerging body of evidence suggests that host microRNAs may favour infection of vertebrate RNA viruses. We have performed high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection and appear to suppress multiple antiviral host molecules. Infection promotion is primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to repress Eph receptors that negatively regulate henipavirus glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion. This study is the first large-scale screen of host-encoded microRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus, and of a BSL-4 virus, and supports the emerging notion that host miRNAs can play a role in supporting infection of RNA viruses.\\n\",\n          \"Vector-borne diseases represent a severe burden to both human and animal health worldwide. The methods currently being used to control a range of these diseases do not appear sufficient to address the issues at hand. As such, alternate methods for the control of vector-borne diseases are currently being investigated. Among the promising techniques currently being considered are a range of genetic control methods known as gene drive systems. These allow desirable genetic traits (such as a much reduced capacity for vectors to transmit viruses) to be spread through a target population; taking advantage of natural mate seeking behaviour to locate vector sub-populations that can be extremely difficult for humans to locate and reach. Here we use mathematical models (parameterised to consider mosquito populations) to demonstrate the robustness of the engineered underdominance and killer-rescue classes of gene drive to different ecological factors including birth and death rates; the number and quality of breeding sites (i.e. carrying capacity); and the strength of density-dependent competition during the larval development phase. We then go on to explore the range of potential outcomes that may result from the migration of individuals between two neighbouring populations.\\n\",\n          \"HIV infection is characterized by a decrease of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the blood. Whereas antiretroviral treatment succeeds to control viral replication, some patients fail to reconstitute their CD4+ T cell count to normal value. IL-7 is a promising cytokine under evaluation for its use in HIV infection, in supplement to antiretroviral therapy, as it increases cell proliferation and survival. Here, we use data from three clinical trials testing the effect of IL-7 on CD4+ T-cell recovery in treated HIV-infected individuals and use a simple mathematical model to quantify IL-7 effects by estimating the biological parameters of the model. We show that the increase of peripheral proliferation could not explain alone the long-term dynamics of T cells after IL-7 injections underlining other important effects such as the improvement of cell survival. We also investigate the feasibility and the efficiency of repetitions of IL-7 cycles and argue for further evaluation through clinical trials.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Converting to CSV\n","test_df.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/DISSERTATION/Dataset/Extracted Dataset (csv)/test_plos.csv', index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"GmaNgVWKQBdp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
