"Hendra Nipah viruses (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus) are bat-borne viruses that cause fatal disease in humans and a range of mammalian species. Gaining deeper understanding of the host pathways exploited by henipaviruses infection will identify targets for new anti-viral therapies. We performed a genome-wide high-throughput agonist antagonist screen at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) that are important for infection and infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 family strongly promoted Hendra virus infection, but did not affect infection with paramyxoviruses and other genera, indicating the specificity of virus-host interaction. Infection promotion was primarily mediated by the ability of miRs-181 to significantly enhance henipovirus-induced membrane fusion. Cell signalling receptors for ephrins, EphA5 and EphB4, were identified as novel negative regulators of henipvirus fusion, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of Ephs and miRNA contributes to enhanced infection and fusion. Immune-responsive miRNA levels were also regulated in biofluids of ferrets and horses infected with Hendra viruses, suggesting a host innate immune response that may promote henipivirus spread and exacerbate disease severity. Our study provides the first comprehensive screen of miRNAs influencing infection in a clinically significant mononegavirus.",0.5023762583732605
"The Aedes aegypti mosquito locus is a mosquito-vector that is genetically engineered to increase the frequency of the population, spreading associated with desirable genetic traits. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. self-sustaining) whilst the killer-rescue system rescue component initially increase frequency (lethal component (killer) is more common) and eventually declining (killer rare) when it is eliminated. The effects of ecological factors on gene drive systems are considered alternative modelling methodologies. We formulate a new set of mathematical models combining population dynamics and population genetics classes of gene drive to incorporate ecological factors previously studied simple to allow the effects to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on potential effects obtained from the result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared to their wild-type counterparts. We extend models to consider population dynamics demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal of neighbouring populations on the outcome of the UD KR gene drive system.",0.5023802518844604
"Exogenous Interleukin-7 (IL-7), a supplement to antiretroviral therapy, leads to a substantial increase in CD4+ T cell subsets in HIV-1 infected patients. However, the quantitative contribution of the potential mechanisms of action of IL-7 is unknown. We performed mathematical analysis of repeated measurements of total naive CD4 + T cells and Ki67 expression in infected patients involved in phase/II studies (N  =  53 patients). We found that IL+7 exerts additional effects on CD4 and T cell dynamics at 52 weeks. A decrease in the loss rate of total CD4/T cell counts is a probable explanation for the effect maintained after repeated administration with IL-8. Our simulation study shows a strategy to allow maintaining CD4 or T cell counts 500 cells/µL for 4 cycles in fewer period of years.",0.5023810863494873
"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is secreted by chemotactic neutrophils, forming a secondary gradient that amplifies the reach of the primary chemoattractant. This strategy increases the recruitment of neutrophil to other cells and is important for inflammation. Here, we show that LTB4 synthesizing enzymes localize to intracellular multivesicular bodies, and release the content of exosomes. Purified exosome release leads to loss of directional motility and concomitant loss of LTB 4 release. Our findings establish that the exosomal pool of L TB4 acts in an autocrine fashion to sensitize neutrophill to the primary and chemoassractant, and in a paracrine fashion to mediate recruitment of neighboring neutrophiles to trans. We envision a mechanism that signals foster communication between cells in harsh extracellular environments.",0.5023826956748962
"Ethylene is one of the most important hormones involved in plant developmental processes and stress responses. However, the regulation of ethylene signaling pathway is largely unknown. Here, we report that phosphorylation of cap binding protein 20 (CBP20) Ser245 is regulated by ethylene, and that this phosphorylation is involved in root growth. We found that the constitutive de-phosphorylation form of CBP20 is able to rescue the root ethylene responsive phenotype cbp20. Furthermore, we found that ethylene regulated gene expression of microRNA (miRNA) expression in roots shoots and shoots was specifically regulated by the roots ethylene treatment. We also found that miR319b is specifically regulated in roots after ethylene treated with ethylene. Our results suggest that ethyl regulated phosphorylated by CBp20 may be involved in the root growth pathway.",0.5023725628852844
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an adverse event that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Given interventions for AKI occurrence and poor performance, there is substantial interest in prediction of AKI prior to diagnosis. However, integration of real-time prognostic modeling with electronic health record (EHR) is challenging, and complex models increase risk of error and complicate deployment. The goal of this study was to create an implementable predictive model to accurately predict AKI in hospitalized patients easily integrated into the existing EHR system. We performed a retrospective analysis looking data from 169,859 hospitalized adults admitted to study hospitals in the United States (New Haven Bridgeport, Connecticut) between December 2012 and February 2016. We developed a model that accurately predicted AKI within 24 hours given observation. The model was trained in a discrete-time logistic regression subset of Hospital 1, internally validated the remainder of Hospital 2, and externally validated Hospital 3. Model performance was assessed using area receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) data sets. The training set cohort contained 60,701 patients, internal validation set contained 30,599 patients, and external validation data sets contained 43,534 35,025 patients. Patients in the overall cohort were generally older (minor age ranging 61 to 68 hospitals) and black, and 23%–29% were admitted to surgical wards. In the training set and the external validation set, 19.1% and 18.9% of patients, respectively, developed AKI. Our model, including covariates, had good ability to predict imminent AKI and good discrimination.",0.5023775696754456
"The emergence of social behaviour is critical for the emergence of animal culture. Several processes are predicted to play key roles in how socially-transmitted information spreads across animal populations: movement of individuals across the landscape and conformist social learning. We develop a model that explicitly integrates these processes to investigate the impacts of the spread of behavioural preferences. Our results reveal a strong interplay between movement and social learning in determining how locally-variable traditions establish a landscape in which a single preference dominates the population. Our model is able to replicate a real-world cultural diffusion experiment in great tits and Parus major, and allows a range of predictions about the emergence and emergence of an animal culture under initial conditions, habitat structure and strength of conformist bias. Integrating social behaviour and ecological variation is important for understanding the stability and diversity of culture in animals.",0.5023835897445679
"The HIV-1 viral load set-point is a surrogate measure of viral virulence, which is subject to natural selection by the human host population. The key test hypothesis is that viral load sets-points are correlated with transmitting individuals acquiring infection. We retrospectively identified 112 heterosexual HIV- discordant couples enrolled in a cohort in Rakai, Uganda, and found that HIV transmission was suspected to occur in 57 couples. We also used sequence data available to establish transmission genetic linkage between 57 couples with strong genetic support for transmission. We estimated the proportion of variance between viral load and set-points explained by similarity between couples (‘couples effect’). Individuals suspected intra-pair transmission (97 couples) were similar to those suspected to transmit HIV. We found that the couple effect explained 16% of the variance in viral loads (23% adjusted). Our findings shed light on the role of viral factors in the pathogenesis and evolution of the virus.",0.5023611187934875
"Aflatoxins are produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus in oil-rich seed grain crops. They are a carcinogenic natural compound known as aflatoxin B1. Sexual reproduction occurs between individuals belonging to different vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs). We examined natural genetic variation in 758 isolates of A. flavus, A. parasiteus and a. minisclerotigenes sampled from a single peanut field in the United States (Georgia), Africa (Benin), Argentina (Córdoba), Australia (Queensland), and India (Karnataka). We found that genetic recombination rates were significantly different between VCGs. We also found that the proportions of MAT1-1 and MAT-2 were highly variable in populations fixed to specific toxin chemotype classes, suggesting asexual sexual reproduction fixation and maintenance. We tested the null hypothesis that an equal number of mating-type individuals were associated with a sexually recombining population. Our results suggest that the reproductive nature of the population (sexual versus asexual) is predictive of aflatoxoxin chemotype diversity in agriculturally important fungi.",0.5023785829544067
"Prions, agents causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, colonize the brain through oral, parenteral, intralingual, and transdermal uptake. However, prions are generally considered airborne. Here, we report that inbred crossbred wild-type mice, tga20 transgenic mice, overexpressing PrPC, efficiently develop scrapie exposure from aerosolized prions. We show that the NSE-PrP transgenic mouse, which express PrPC selectively in neurons, is more susceptible to airborne prions than the uninfected mice. Aerogenic infection occurred in mice lacking B- T- lymphocytes, NK-cells, follicular dendritic cells, and complement components. Brains of diseased mice contained PrPSc transmitted to scrapie inoculated mice. We conclude that aerogenic exposure to prions is efficacious and can lead to direct invasion of neural pathways and the obligatory replicative phase of lymphoid organs. This previously unappreciated risk of airborne prion transmission warrant-thinking prion biosafety guidelines for research and diagnostic laboratories.",0.5023819208145142
"Taenia tapeworms are a mosquito-borne parasite that infects rodents and lagomorphs. The larval stage of Taenia serialis commonly parasitizes rodents, primates and primates endemic to Ethiopia. Geladas exhibit protuberant larval cysts indicative of advanced T. serialis infection and are associated with high mortality. However, non-protuberant larvae develop in the deep tissue of the abdominal cavity, leading to underestimates of the prevalence based solely on the presence of cysts. We adapted a non-invasive monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect circulating TaenIA spp. antigen in dried gelada urine. We found that ELISA was highly accurate in detecting TaENia antigen, with 98.4% specificity, 98.5% sensitivity, area curve 0.99. We also found that the prevalence of infection was substantially widespread in the wild gelada population, with a substantially widespread occurrence of visible T.serialis cysts (16.4%, 6% of the population exhibited cysts) and a significant sex bias in the cyst presence. Contrary to the female-biased bias observed in Taenias-host systems, we found no sex bias between cyst and antigen presence (older individuals were more likely to have cysts), and no age bias in antigen presence. We interpret this finding to indicate that T. seris infects individuals early in life and may result in visible disease later in life.",0.5023833513259888
"Horizontal gene transfer mediated by plasmid conjugation plays a significant role in the evolution of bacterial species, dissemination of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity determinants. Characterization of regulation is important for gaining insights into its features. Relatively little is known about how conjugations of Gram-positive plasmids are regulated. Here, we characterized the expression of the native Bacillus subtilis pLS20 gene. Contrary to enterococcal and other Gram-negative Plasmids, conjugated pLSs are activated by recipient-produced pheromones. We found that conjugate is kept in a default “” state and identified a master repressor responsible for its repression. Activation of conjugating genes requires relief from repression, mediated by an anti-repressor that belongs to the Rap family of proteins. Using RNA sequencing methodology and genetic approaches, we determined the regulatory effects of repressor and anti-receptor expression on pLS 20 genes. We show that the activity of the anti-regressor is regulated by an intercellular signaling peptide. Ultimately, the peptide dictates the timing of conjugeation. The implications of this regulatory mechanism in comparison to mobile systems are discussed.",0.5023825168609619
"Zoonotic disease (ZD) poses a threat to human health in low-income countries. In many countries, the human burden of disease is underestimated due to insufficient monitoring and insufficient funding. Quantification of the impact of zoonoses helps prioritizing healthcare needs. Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with 48% of its population employed in agriculture and a population living below the poverty line. We conducted a systematic review of the burden of ZD and assessed the impact on ZDs. We collected data on the estimated burden of zDs and addressed the underestimation of officially reported disease incidence. We estimated the incidences of ZDs and calculate the incidence-based Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The standardized health gap measure enhances comparability of injuries and diseases. The combined burden of alveolar and cystic echinococcosis, cystic and campylobacteriosis, congenital toxoplasmosis, non-typhoidal salmonellosis, and rabies in 2013 was 35,209 DALYS [95% Uncertainty interval (UI):13,413–83,777]; 576 deaths were attributed to infections. This estimate is comparable to HIV. Community-based surveillance studies and hospital-based registration of occurrences of Zoonoses will increase the accuracy of estimates.",0.502379298210144
"Vaccinia virus (VACV) and K1 C7 are two major poxviruses that cause disease in humans and animals. In mammals, the virus is able to replicate in a wide range of host tissues, including ruminants. However, the host-specific differences in the SAMD9/SAMD9L genes are not well understood. In this study, we show that the human SAMD 9, a tumor suppressor restriction factor, antagonizes two classes of poxvirus proteins, the vaccinia virus K1 and C7. In contrast, the mammalian SAMD8, a protein that is encoded by the virus, functions similarly in mammals, and is a critical host barrier against poxiruses to overcome establish infection. In mice, we find that the virus can overcome the restriction of the virus by inhibiting the virus's replication and pathogenesis. In addition, we demonstrate that the S.AMD9 and S.M.L restriction factors are able to overcome the virus’s restriction of K1, C7, and the K1-C7 homologs in diverse mammalian poxiviruses, indicating that the host species-specific difference in the two genes serves as a barrier to cross-species poxirus transmission.",0.5023833513259888
"High levels of serum IgE are considered to be markers of parasite helminth exposure. In addition, they are associated with allergic disorders, and play a key role in anti-tumoral defence, which are crucial mediators of autoimmune diseases. Total IgE is a strongly heritable trait. In this genome-wide association study (GWAS), we tested 353,569 SNPs for association with total IgE levels in 1,530 individuals from a population-based KORA S3/F3 study. Replication was performed independent of population-wide study samples (total n  =  9,769 individuals). Functional variants of a gene encoding alpha chain high affinity receptor IgE (FCER1A) on chromosome 1q23 (rs2251746 and rs2427837) were strongly associated with total and serum levels in cohorts with P values of 1.85×10−20 and 7.08×10–19 combined analysis. Furthermore, post- hoc analysis showed additional associations with allergic sensitization (P values of 7.78x10−4 P = 1.95×10+3) and increased risk of atopic eczema and asthma. Our GWAS data also confirm the association between gene expression and IgE level.",0.5023818612098694
"Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated double-stranded DNA poxvirus currently developed as a vaccine vector for HIV/AIDS. Profiling innate immune responses induced by MVA is essential for the design of vaccine vectors anticipating potential adverse interactions with naturally acquired vaccine-induced immune responses. In this study, we report the innate immune sensing of MVA cytokine responses in human THP-1 cells, primary human macrophages and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDMs). We found that innate immune response elicited in MVA in human BMDMs was characterized by robust chemokine production and a fairly weak pro-inflammatory cytokine response. We also identified a critical role for TLR2, TLR6 and MyD88 in the production of IFNβ-independent chemokines. MVA induced marked-regulation of the expression of RIG-like receptors (RLR) and IPS-1 adapter (known as Cardif, MAVS VISA) and reduced expression of NALP3, ASC and caspase-1 shRNAs. Innate immune sensing by the MVA host is essential to the development of new vaccine vectors.",0.5023834109306335
"Proteome utilization is a key determinant of cellular growth rates and fitness. However, the magnitude of variability in un-utilized protein expression in natural settings is unknown, largely due to the challenge of determining environment-specific proteome utilization. Here, we address this challenge by combining absolute global proteomics data combined with a recently developed genome-scale model of Escherichia coli. We show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments accounting for the cost of unused protein expression explains >95% of the variance in growth rates across 16 distinct environments. Furthermore, reduction in unused protein is shown to be a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rate in adaptive evolution experiments. We also show that unused protein encodes nutrient-stress- and preparedness functions, which convey fitness benefits in varying environments. Finally, unused protein can be a source of large pervasive fitness costs that provide a benefit for hedging environmental change.",0.5023797750473022
"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains are defined as extracellular pathogens that nucleate actin rich pedestal-like membrane extensions that intestinal enterocytes intimately adhere to. EPEC infection is mediated by type III secretion system effectors, which modulate host cell signaling. Recently, we have shown that WxxxE effector EspT activates Rac1 Cdc42 leading to membrane ruffles in lamellipodia. We report that EspT-induced membrane ruffleles facilitate EPEC invasion of non-phagocytic cells via Rac1 Wave2. Internalized EPEC resides in the vacuole membrane of the intestinal enterocyte and is localized to a vacuolar membrane, resulting in actin polymerization and formation of intracellular pedestals. Our data breaks the dogma that EPEC is a new category of invasive EPEC.",0.5023838877677917
"The plant Arabidopsis halleri is a compelling model for extremophile, physiologically distinct sister species of A. lyrata, A. thaliana. Naturally selected metal hypertolerance and extraordinarily high leaf metal accumulation in A. halleri require Heavy Metal ATPase4 (HMA4), a PIB-type ATPase that pumps Zn2+ and Cd2+ into specific cell types. Strongly enhanced HMA4 expression results from a combination of gene copy number expansion and cis-regulatory modifications, compared to A. albopictus. Our studies addressed the nucleotide sequence polymorphism loci known to govern adaptation to environmental adaptation. We sequenced 13 DNA segments in the HMA1 genomic region of multiple A.halleri individuals in diverse habitats. Compared to control loci flanking tandem HMA2 gene copies, gradual depletion of nucleotide sequences and excess of low-frequency polymorphisms hallmarks positive selection of HMA3 promoter regions, culminating in HMA-3-3. These findings constitute an unexpectedly complex profile of polymorphism resulting from natural selection and increased gene product dosage. We propose that these findings constitute a paradigmatic category of multi-copy genes in a broad range of organisms.",0.502380907535553
"Neural oscillations are the most important biological processes in the brain. However, the mechanisms underlying these oscillations remain poorly understood. Here, we use a phenomenological model of delay-combined oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify the underlying principles of spatio-temporal structure that governs phase lags and oscillatory activity in distant regions. Phase relations in regions of stability are derived from numerically confirmed oscillators networks randomly distributed into clustered bimodal delays, which are an approximation of brain structural connectivity. In-phase, clustered delays induce anti-phase synchronization at certain frequencies, and sign lags are determined by natural frequencies of inhomogeneous network interactions. In -phase, faster oscillators phase lead, stronger connected nodes lag at a weaker frequency of depression, and consistently arises in silico results. We show that in-phase correlations between oscillators and the brain can be quantitatively affected by the temporal structure that renders phases distributed 0 π.",0.5023285746574402
"Neurons in the insect antennal lobe represent odors in spatiotemporal patterns that unfold over multiple time scales. These patterns unspool and decrease overlap between odor representations, which increase the ability of the olfactory system to discriminate odors. In this study, we examined two competing components of this process – lateral excitation and local excitatory interneurons, and slow inhibition of local inhibitory interneuron activity. We found that lateral excitations amplified differences in representations of similar odors recruiting projection neurons to receive direct input from olfaction receptors. Slow inhibition curtailed the spread of projection neuron activity and increased response reliability. These competing influences were finely balanced in order to decorrelate odor representations.",0.5023629069328308
"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative agent of severe arthralgia in Africa, Asia, Europe, and recently, the Americas. In recent outbreaks, CHIKV is recognized as manifesting neurologic signs of illness and elderly co- morbidities; however, the syndrome caused by the syndrome is self-limited; patients develop persistent arthrralgias for months to years. Despite its importance as a human health and economic standpoint, there is no licensed vaccine specific treatment to prevent CHIKF. In this study, we have begun to elucidate the pathogenesis of CHIKCF and its mechanism of persistent and chronic arthrafilaria, which is poorly understood. In addition, we lack an animal model of chronic infection and limited studies of CHKV pathogenesis and ability to assess the safety of vaccine candidates currently in development. To address this deficiency, recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1-/-) knockout mice, deficient in T B lymphocytes, develop a chronic CHIK virus infection model. This model will be used for evaluating the safety and efficacy of a live-attenuated vaccine candidate.",0.5023678541183472
"Noroviruses, the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans, recognize histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) as the most susceptible factors in a strain-specific manner. However, crystal structures of HBGA-binding interfaces/B/H-binding norovirus, the prototype Norwalk virus (GI.1) and predominant GII.4 strain (VA387), have not been elucidated. In this study, we determined the crystal structures and binding properties of the P domain protein of the Lewis-binding Norwalkirus (VA207, GIII.9) and the distinct binding property of the VA387 P protein. Co-crystalization of VA207 and the P dimer Ley sialyl Lex tetrasaccharides showed that VA207 interacts with the two major binding sites found in VA387 and that VA387 is highly conserved among GII norovirus. Our results provide insight into the complex interaction between diverse noroviraluses and polymorphic HBGAs.",0.5023837685585022
"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is one of the most common etiological agents of Paracoccidaidomycosis (PCM). Despite the long latency period, clinical isolates reflect the spatial distribution of the pathogens. Molecular detection of P. brasilensis and P. lutzii in soil, in isolation of wild animals and armadillos, is important for monitoring the environmental geographical distribution. In this study, we aimed to detect, time, and evaluate the genetic diversity of the species of Pc. brasiliens and Pc lutzi in endemic and non-endemic areas of the environment, using Nested PCR and situ hybridization techniques. In addition, we identified genetic variants in the soil and aerosol samples from armadillo burrows, armadilla samples, and soil samples from clinical armadilli samples, suggesting greater genetic variability in the environment than in vertebrate hosts. Our results indicate that the actual occurrence of Parcoccidios species in saprobic habitat, despite the absence/non-detection of seven armadillary species evaluated in regions with high prevalence of PCM infection, is possible.",0.5023831725120544
"Cholera is a tropical disease caused by the bacterium cholera, which is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito. Cholera can be fatal if not treated with appropriate treatment. In this study, we used PubMed and ProMED searches for information from 2008–2013 and event-based surveillance reports from 2010–2013, to assess the epidemiology of chola in the Philippines. Using spatial log regression, we identified 12 articles from ProMED PubMed reported in chola Philippines between 2008 and 2013. Data from ProMed surveillance revealed 42,071 suspected confirmed and confirmed cases in 2008 and 5,006 confirmed cases between 2013 and 2014. The overall case fatality ratio was 0.62%, 2% outbreaks per 100,000 population. We found that poor access to improved sanitation was consistently associated with higher chola incidence in suspected and confirmed confirmed cases. Paradoxically, access improved water sources were associated with a higher chOLera incidence than suspected confirmed cases and data sources. Our findings highlight the need to maintain infrastructure and non-chlorination water supplies, emphasizing the need for maintain public water systems.",0.5023784637451172
"Female genital schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Schistosoma haematobium, which is transmitted to humans through the genital mucosa of the female genital tract. It is a major public health problem in the developing world and is associated with a high risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The aim of this study was to quantify the characteristics of the vasculature surrounding the parasite and to identify the factors that influence the risk of HIV infection. In this study, we found that the blood vessels surrounding the infected parasite were significantly vascularised compared to the healthy cervical mucosa. In addition, the blood vessel proliferation was associated with granulation of tissue surrounding viable compared to calcified ova (p = 0.032) and the tendency of neovascularisation of the tissue surrounding the viable ova compared to healthy cervical tissue. Our findings suggest that female genital lesions are associated with the presence of granulation and tissue rich in sprouting blood vessels.",0.5023793578147888
"Mitosis and meiosis are distinct cell division programs. During meiosis, sister chromatids separate, meiotic division, and homologous chromosomes pair to segregate. In most organisms, germ cells programs sequentially, amplify mitosis, switching meiosis to produce haploid gametes. However, autosomal chromosomes are unpaired centromeres in Drosophila germline stem cells, paired following mitosis. Surprisingly, we show that components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex, expressed in the mitotic region of ovaries, localize close to centromres, and promote de novo association with centromere. These results demonstrate that the meiotic proteins and meiotic organization of centomeres, key features that ensure reductional segregation, are laid by amplifying germ cells, and that meiosis started.",0.5023601055145264
"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an important cause of disease in humans and animal hosts. The host-to-host transmission pathogen ensures successful propagation and maintenance of the host population. The striking feature of disease transmission heterogeneity is the heterogeneity of host infectiousness. In the proposed host population, 20% of infected hosts, termed super-shedders, are responsible for 80% of the disease transmission. However, little is known about the immune state of super-hedders. In this study, we used a model organism of Salmonella, a major cause of human disease in animal hosts, to study the immune response of the super-shedder mice. We found that the active inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract and spleen dampened the TH1 response in specific secondary lymphoid organs. Furthermore, G-CSF-treated mice had higher numbers of neutrophils, a dampened T cell response, characterized by higher levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs), fewer T-bet+ (TH1) T cells and blunted cytokine responsiveness. These results demonstrate a novel role for neutrophil in blunting IL-2-mediated proliferation of the TH2 immune response in spleens.",0.5023820400238037
"Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Triatoma infestans. The parasite is transmitted by blood-sucking insects that feed on the blood of humans, chickens, and other domestic animals. In this study, we investigated the factors that affect blood-feeding rates, proportion of human-fed bugs (human blood index), and daily human-feeding rate of the main vector of Chagas. We used a cross-sectional survey collected from triatomines in human sleeping quarters (domiciles) in 49 270 rural houses in northwestern Argentina. We developed an improved way of estimating the human-filling rate of domestic T. infestan populations. We fitted generalized linear mixed-effects models to a global model of explanatory variables (chicken blood index, dog blood index and bug stage, numbers of human residents, bug abundance, maximum temperature of night preceding bug catch) and response variables (daily blood-fed rate, human blood index) to the response variables. Coefficients estimated by multimodel inference were 0.231 (95% confidence interval, 0.157–0.305). Based on the changing availability of chickens and domiciles in spring-summer and larger infectivity of dogs compared to humans, we infer the net effects of chickens in the presence of transmission-competent hosts adequately described zoopotentiation and zooprophylaxis.",0.502383828163147
"Genes that allow cells to cope with oncogene-induced stress represent selective cancer therapeutic targets that remain largely undiscovered. In this study, we identify the RhoJ signaling pathway as a selective therapeutic target for BRAF mutant melanoma tumors. We show that deletion of the BRAF signaling pathway modulates expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD genes involved in cellular metabolism, impairing nevus formation, cellular transformation, and metastasis. Short-term treatment with nascent melanoma tumor PAK inhibitors block Rhoj signaling and halts the growth of BRAF mutants in vitro and induces apoptosis of melanoma cells in vitro. We also show that over 50% of human melanomas express high levels of RHOJ, suggesting that this signaling network may be a therapeutic vulnerability for budding BRAF and human tumors.",0.5023769736289978
"The protein structure classification schemes exist to partition the protein universe into structural units called folds. The schemes discuss how these units sit relative to the global structure space. In this paper we construct networks to describe the global relationships between folds and form structural bridges. We generate networks using different structural alignment methods and multiple score thresholds. We find that networks constructed by different methods remain similar distance apart regardless of the probability threshold defining a structural bridge. We suggest that structural bridges method is a specific attempt to build a picture of structural space reliant on a single structural superposition method. Despite differences in representations, we agree that the organisation of fold space is principal community structures:- α,-β sandwiches, -β barrels, α/β and α+ β. We also find that fold ages in networks are associated with higher age differences between bridged folds, and that the difference increases the number of networks displaying the edge. Our findings suggest that evolutionary information encoded by structural bridges may be encoded in structural structures. Finally, we identify highly central pivotal folds representing dominant topological features that act as key attractors to landscapes.",0.5023497939109802
"Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is one of the most prevalent human prion diseases, and is caused by infectious prion protein (PrPSc). The origin of sCJD is unknown, and the initiating event is thought to be stochastic misfolding of the endogenous prion proteins (PrPC) by infectious PrPSc. In contrast, human growth hormone-associated cases of iatrogenic CJD (iCJD), in the United Kingdom (UK), are associated with exposure to an exogenous source of prPSc, which is known to cause disease phenotype, onset, and disease duration. However, the relative contribution of PrPC allotype to PrCJD in heterozygous cases of CJD is unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we determined the relative abundance of PrPPSc M V residue 129 in brain specimens of MV cases of the UK. We found that PrPC containing M V and 129 having a similar propensity to misfold PrPsc causing sCsJD. In comparison, PrPSC containing V and 124 predominated in the majority of UK human growth hormones associated with iCJD cases, consistent with exposure of infectious PrPsSc containing V or 129. These results suggest that the factors that influence CJD type, age and clinical onset, disease duration, and clinical progression are important for the clinical progression and phenotype of heterozygozygous and non-homozygous CJD cases.",0.5023838877677917
"BMP signaling is critical for synapse growth and homeostasis. Signaling of the BMP7 homolog, Gbb, in motor neurons triggers a canonical pathway that modulates transcription of BMP target genes, a noncanonical pathway, that connects local BMP/BMP receptor complexes to the cytoskeleton. Here, we describe a novel pathway that is characterized by accumulation of a pathway effector, phosphorylated Smad (pMad), at synaptic sites. We demonstrate that this pathway is genetically distinguishable from known BMP signaling cascades. We show that this novel pathway does not require Gbb and depends on presynaptic BMP receptors for specific postsynaptic glutamate receptor subtypes, type-receptor subtypes. Instead, selective disruption of the pMad accumulation reduces synaptic levels at type- receptors, revealing a positive feedback loop that appears to function to stabilize active type-Receptor synaptic sites and to stabilize synapse activity.",0.5073907971382141
"Selective dimerization of basic-region leucine- zipper (bZIP) transcription factors presents a vivid example of the high degree of interaction specificity achieved by a family of structurally similar proteins. The coiled-coil motif mediates homo- and hetero-dimerization of bZIP proteins and has been intensively studied, and a variety of methods have been proposed to predict interactions with sequence data. In this work, we develop a predictive model that exploits the knowledge of the structurally conserved residue-and residue interactions of the coiled coil motif. The model, which expresses the interaction energies in sum of interpretable residue-pair triplet terms, achieves correlation between experimental binding free energies and R = 0.68 significantly-performs scoring functions. We use the model to develop novel synthetic peptides for assembling and assembling 7- residue native-protein heptad modules into new combinations. We find that the optimal combination of heptads can bind selectively to human bZip domains, and target paralogs. Our approach, which is based on a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, confirmed the formation of tight selective heterodimers for the designed peptides.",0.5073907971382141
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred method for diagnosing knee injuries. However, the interpretation of knee MRI is time-intensive and has diagnostic error variability. We developed a deep learning model that can automatically learn layers of features, suited for modeling complex relationships between medical images and interpretations. We measured the effect of providing model predictions on clinical experts’ interpretation of MRI exams. The dataset consisted of 1,370 knee MRI exams performed at Stanford University Medical Center between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2012 (mean age 38.0 years; 569 [41.5%] female patients). The majority of the 3 musculoskeletal radiologists established reference standard labels and internal validation sets for 120 exams. We also developed MRNet, a convolutional neural network classifying MRI series combined with predictions of 3 series of exam logistic regression. MRNet trained the entire internal validation set on 183 exams, and MRNet was trained on the Stanford sagittal T2-weight series of labels of ACL tears, meniscal tears, and ACL tears. Our results support the assertion that deep learning models improve performance of clinical experts in medical imaging interpretation.",0.5073907971382141
"Streptomyces cerevisiae is the most important bacterium in the world. It is important to understand the mechanisms by which this bacterium functions. In this study, we have defined the BldM-WhiI system as a functional heterodimer that controls the expression of Group II and Group II genes. We show that Group II gene expression depends on bldM and WhiI, and that Bldm is required for the formation of aerial hyphae and for the differentiation of reproductive structures in mature spores. We also show that the two genes are dependent on each other for their expression. We further show that this system is able to control both the expression and expression of the Group I genes.",0.5073907971382141
"The circadian clockwork is a complex of proteins that are composed of a number of proteins, each of which is regulated by a specific molecular mechanism. In this study, we analyze the biochemical basis of the oscillator by quantifying time-dependent interactions between proteins (KaiA, KaiB, KaiC) and electron microscopy. We derive a dynamic model of the in vitro oscillator that accurately reproduces the rhythms of KaiA and KaiB complexes and KaiC phosphorylation, consistent with biophysical observations of individual Kai protein interactions. We use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to confirm that monomer exchange between KaiC and hexamers occurs, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. Finally, we apply perturbation analyses to test the resetting characteristics of the KaiABC oscillator, testing resetting properties of the unique circadian oscillator.",0.5073907971382141
"Genomic mapping of DNA replication origins (ORIs) in mammals provides a powerful means of understanding the regulatory complexity of the genome. We combine a genome-wide approach to identify preferential sites for DNA replication initiation in 0.4% of the mouse genome and detailed molecular analysis of distinct classes of ORIs according to their location relative to their relative genes. Our study reveals that 85% of replication initiation sites in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are associated with transcriptional units. Nearly half of the ORIs map promoter regions, and interestingly, ORI density strongly correlates with promoter density, reflecting coordinated organisation of replication transcription in the mouse mouse genome. Detailed analysis of ORI activity showed that CpG island promoter-ORIs are more efficient than ORIs in ES cells and that ORI specification and firing efficiency are maintained in all cell types. Remarkably, the distribution of transcription initiation sites at promoter- ORIs exactly parallels those at transcription start sites (TSS) and TSS, suggesting co-evolution of regulatory regions driving replication transcription. This association implies that transcription initiation in early development sets the probability for ORI activation, unveiling a new hallmark in ORI efficiency regulation in mammalian cells.",0.5073907971382141
"Skeletal muscle morphogenesis transforms short muscle precursor cells into long, multinucleate myotubes that anchor tendons at the myotendinous junction (MTJ). In vertebrates, a great deal is known about the muscle specification of somitic cells, but the molecular factors that limit elongation are unknown. In zebrafish, fast muscle fiber morphogenesis consists of three discrete phases: short precursor cells, intercalation/extensionation, and boundary capture/myotube formation. During the first phase, cells exhibit randomly directed protrusive activity, followed by a three-step process: protrusion extension filling and elongation. The repetition of protrusion and extension filling continues until the anterior posterior ends of the muscle fiber reach MTJ. Finally, the ends of muscle fiber anchor MTJ undergo morphogenetic changes that adopt a stereotypical, cylindrical shape. We find that the basement membrane protein laminin is required for efficient elongation, proper fiber orientation, boundary capture, and myotub formation. Lamininα2 mutant embryos exhibit early muscle defects in contrast to later dystrophic phenotypes. Surprisingly, our genetic mosaic analysis suggests that boundary capture is a cell-autonomous phenomenon. Taken together, our results define two distinct phases in muscle fiber morphology that are critical for the second phase elongation and the repetitive process of protrusive extension and protrusion filling.",0.5073907971382141
"Stem cell dynamics in vivo have been studied using lineage tracing methods. The laboratory previously developed a retrospective method for reconstructing stem cell lineage trees from somatic mutations accumulated in microsatellites. This method was applied to explore different aspects of stem cell dynamics using stem cell markers. We demonstrated the reliability of this method to study stem cells confirming previously established facts, and addressed open questions. Our findings confirmed that the colon crypts are monoclonal, adulthood, and that the process of monoclal conversion plays a major role in maintenance of crypts. In addition, we confirmed a positive correlation between physical lineage proximity and crypts, showing that colon and hematopoietic cells share a common ancestor. We gained new data demonstrating that colon epithelium clustered separately with hematopsoietical cell types, indicating that colon constituted progenitors ruling a significant renewal of colonic epithelialium in hematospoietics in adulthood. Overall, our study demonstrates the reliability and reliability of cell lineage reconstruction and study of stem cells, and addresses the open questions of colon stem cells.",0.5073907971382141
"Gambian sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis, HAT) outbreaks brought by case detection and treatment are recognised typically reaches 75% of the population. Vector control is capable of completely interrupting HAT transmission but is considered expensive and difficult to organise in resource-poor settings. We conducted a scale field trial with refined vector control technology to determine the utility and utility of control of Gambian HAT. The major vector of G. fuscipes is the tsetse fly, Glossina fusipes, which lives in a humid zone immediately adjacent to water bodies. A series of preliminary trials determined that a number of tiny targets were required to reduce Tsetse populations to 90%. The data model calibration predicted that the target density of 20 linear km of river riverine savannah could achieve >90% of tse control. We carried out a scale, 500 km2 field trial covering HAT foci in Northern Uganda to determine efficacy of the tiny targets (the overall target density was 5.7/km2). After 12 months, tsetes populations declined 90%. A guide published by the U.K. Ministry of Health suggests that a 72% reduction in tsete population is required to stop transmission in these settings. The Ugandan census suggests that the population density of HAT in these foci is approximately 500km2. The estimated cost of a single round of active case detection (excluding treatment) covering 80% of population, US$ 433,333 (figures) for a year of vector control in an organised country, completely stop HAT and transmission, would be US$ 42,700. The case for adding a method of mosquito control to case detection treatment is strong.",0.5073907971382141
"The 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak massively hit Guinea. The coastal districts of Boffa, Dubreka and Forecariah, major foci of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), were particularly affected. We aimed to assess the impact of epidemic sleeping sickness screening and caring activities on HAT burden in Guinea. We used preexisting data from the Guinean sleeping sickness control program, collected between 2012 and 2015. We compared the number of persons screened actively; (i) passively; (iii) treated with HAT; and (iv) attending post-treatment follow-up visits. We found that the proportion of persons who were actively screened during the Ebola outbreak decreased by 44% compared to the pre-Ebola period. Active screening campaigns were stopped in early 2014. The number of people tested passively per month increased from 7 286 April September 2014 to 180 January 2015 March 2015. The proportion of patients who initiated HAT treatment, 154 (72%) Ebola, and 59 (28%) Ebola outbreak cases were recruited for passive screening. We also found that patients who were recruited to passive screening were diagnosed with later stage 2 disease (96% vs. 55% Ebola, p<0.0001). Active screening activities were stopped. Passive screening dramatically decreased in the Ebola period, and retention rates were lower than those of the pre–Eebola period (data available). The drop in newly diagnosed HAT cases was unlikely to fall in HAT incidence. We were unable demonstrate directly, probably in consequence of hampered screening activities and fear of the population subsequent confirmation of linkage care. Reinforced program monitoring, alternative control strategies and sustainable financial and human resources allocation should be mandatory for the post-Ebo period.",0.5073907971382141
"Many plants exhibit a variety of different life histories. For example, annual plants live a year flowering and produce seeds that are senesce. In contrast, perennials live two years, dividing life cycle episodes between vegetative growth and flowering. Environmental cues control key check points in the life histories of annuals. Genes controlling responses to environmental cues exhibit natural genetic variation. Here, we characterize the genetic variation conferring differences in the perennial life cycle of Arabis alpina. Previously, we show that accessions to Pajares require a prolonged exposure to cold (ivernalization) and a limited period of returning to growth. Genetic complementation showed that these accessions carry mutant alleles of PERPETUAL FLOWERING 1 (PEP1), which encodes the MADS box transcription factor orthologous to the FLOWERing LOCUS C in annual Arabidopsis thaliana. We also show that the PEP1 locus contains a tandem arrangement of length and partial PEP 1 copy, and rise-length transcripts are differentially expressed. These results provide a paradigm for how perennial phenotypes arise.",0.5073907971382141
"In the bacterial world, methylation is commonly associated with restriction-modification systems, which provide a defense mechanism against invading foreign genomes. In addition, it is known that methylation plays functionally important roles, including timing of DNA replication, chromosome partitioning, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression. However, DNA methylome analyses are scarce and lack a simple methodology for rapid sensitive detection of common epigenetic marks ( ie N6-methyladenine (6 mA) and N4-methylcytosine (4 mC). Here, we use Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing to determine the methylomes of two human pathogen species, Mycoplasma genitalium and G-37 Mycotoplasma pneumoniae and M129, using single-base resolution. Our analysis identified two new methylation motifs previously described in bacteria: a widespread 6 mA and a complex Type m6A sequence motif in M. pneumoniae (5′-GAN7TAY-3′/3′-CTN7ATR-5′). We identify a methyltransferase that is responsible for this common motif and suggest that it may be involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.",0.5073907971382141
"Fascioliasis is a parasitic disease that is associated with liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and cancer. In order to describe the current evidence, we carried out a systematic review to assess the association between F. hepatica and liver cancer. We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases ( PubMed, LILACS, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, Scielo) and found 1,557 published studies. 21 studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 studies explored the association with F. liver and fibrosis. Globally studies suggested that the ability of F. hepatatica to promote liver cancer is unknown. Given the heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis was performed. Future high-quality studies are needed to determine the role of the F. Hepatica in the development and development of liver cancer in humans.",0.5073907971382141
"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is challenging cross-reactivity between dengue virus (DENV) and Zika antibody responses during pregnancy. We described ZIKV and DENV serological markers and maternal-fetal transfer antibodies in mothers and neonates during the ZIKZ microcephaly outbreak in Northeast Brazil (2016). We included 89 microcephalous cases and 173 neonate controls at the time of birth of the birth mothers. The majority of the cases were defined as newborns with particular head circumference (2 SD mean) and the controls had a different expected date of delivery area and residence. We also tested maternal serum and maternal serum for recent (VEV genome, IgM IgG3 and anti-NS1) and previous (VEZV DENV neutralizing antibodies [NAbs] markers during infection. Multiple markers of recent or DENV infection in mothers were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA discriminated between distinct components related to recent or previous VEZV infection. We detected high frequency of ZIKVs exposure in the mothers of the wave of Zika virus outbreak.",0.5073907971382141
"African trypanosome procyclic forms multiply in the midgut of tsetse flies, routinely cultured at 27°C. Heat shocks at 37°C result in general inhibition of translation, and severe heat shock (41°C) results in sequestration of mRNA into granules. MRNAs are bound to the zinc-finger protein ZC3H11, including encoding refolding chaperones, and escape heat-induced translation inhibition. At 27 °C, the mRNA is predominantly present in the untranslated cytosolic messenger ribonucleoprotein particle, but at 37 °C—41 °C the ZC 3H11 mRNA moves through the polysomal fraction. We investigated the scope and specificities of heat-shock translational regulation and granule formation, and analysed distributions of mRNAs in polysomes from 27° C to 1 hour at 39°C, and mRNA content at 41°C in heat shock granules and at 41 °C. We found that the mRNA content of mRNA that bind to the protein was stable at 39 °C and protected from sequestration in granules at 41–C. In contrast to previously seen starvation and stress granules, mRNas encode ribosomal proteins that are excluded from heat shock and are not sequestered in the granules during heat shock. These results suggest that heat shock may be an important factor in the efficiency of procyclics to develop mammalian-infective forms.",0.5073907971382141
"Low socioeconomic position (SEP) is recognized as a risk factor for worse health outcomes. However, the magnitude of the effect is poorly understood. In this review, we aimed to synthesise associations between measures of SEP and use of healthcare during the year of life. We searched for data on the quality of healthcare in high-income countries. We included empirical observational studies from high- and medium-quality countries reporting association with SEP (e.g., income, education, occupation, private medical insurance status, housing tenure, housing quality, area-based deprivation) with place of death, plus use of acute care, specialist nonspecialist end-of-life care, advance care planning, and quality of care for year life. The overall strength and direction of associations were summarised, and sufficient comparable data were available, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and pooled dose-response meta-analysis were performed. A total of 209 studies were included (mean NOS quality score of 4.8) and 112 high-medium-quality observational studies were meta-analyzed. We found that people living in deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to die in hospital versus home (1.30, 95% CI 1.23–1.38, p <0.001), receive acute hospital-based care at 3 months life ( 1.16, 95%) and receive specialist palliative care at 4 months life.",0.5073907971382141
"Adherence clubs, groups of 25–30 patients with virally suppressed antiretroviral therapy (ART) meet for counseling and medication pickup, represent an innovative model to retain patients care and facilitate task-shifting. This intervention replaces traditional clinical care encounters with a 1-hour group session 2–3 months, organized in a clinic community venue. We performed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to compare loss of club-based care with community-based adherence clubs. We found that patients with ART with undetectable viral load were more likely to be lost to clinic-based treatment than those who were not at the clinic. We also found that people who were referred to the clinic for standard care missed a club visit to pick ART medications 5 days, 2 consecutive late ART medication pickups, and developed disqualifying (excluding) comorbidity, viral rebound, and viral rebound. Overall, we found that the overall loss of adherence to club intervention was 52% (95% CI 47%–57%) and the cumulative proportion of lost adherence to treatment was 52%, compared to 43%. The risk of loss to club adherence was 3% in the same arm, but not in the different arm.",0.5073907971382141
"Mobile group II introns consist of the catalytic intron RNA and intron-encoded protein reverse transcriptase activity, which act as a ribonucleoprotein particle to promote DNA integration into intron mobility. Previously, we found that the Lactococcus lactis LltrB intron encoded protein (LtrA) is expressed as a protein that localizes to the bacterial cellular poles, potentially accounting for intron preferential insertion into oriC and ter regions of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Here, we identified E. coli genes (gppA, uhpT, wcaK, ynbC, zntR) that disrupt the localization of LtrA. Surprisingly, we find that a common factor affecting LtrB localization disrupts the accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate, which appears to bind to LTrA basic proteins and delocalize away from the poles. Our findings suggest that intracllular localization of a group II intron and encoded protein is a major determinant of insertion-site preference and provide a means of localizing proteins to different sites during action of cellular stress during the stationary phase, potentially with wide physiological consequences.",0.5073907971382141
"In this study, we decoded monkey functional MRI (fMRI) responses evoked stimuli signaling near far depths defined by binocular disparity, relative motion, and combination, compared to the results of an identical experiment previously performed in humans. We found that the monkey area of the MT computes fusion disparity between motion and motion depth signals, exactly as shown by human area of V3B/K kinetic occipital area (VEO). Our data reconcile previously reported discrepancies in depth processing in human monkey showing involvement in dorsal stream depth cue integration technique, despite engagement from different regions.",0.5073907971382141
"MicroRNAs belonging to the miR-34 family have been proposed to be critical modulators of the p53 pathway and potential tumor suppressors in human cancers. To formally test these hypotheses, we generated mice carrying targeted deletion of members of the microRNA family. We found that the complete inactivation of miRNA-34 function is compatible with normal development in mice. Surprisingly, p53 function appears to be intact in the majority of the cells in the mice. However, loss of miR–34 expression leads to a slight increase in cellular proliferation in vitro, and impair p53-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, in contrast to p53–deficient mice, the mice display increased susceptibility to spontaneous, irradiation-induced, c-Myc–induced tumorigenesis. These findings suggest that miR34 plays a redundant function in p53 signaling, and suggest additional roles in the family of miRNAs.",0.5073907971382141
"Insulin is a major regulator of metabolism in metazoans, including fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest a genetic basis for reductions in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, phenotypes commonly observed in humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To identify the molecular functions of genes linked to T2DM risk, we developed a genetic tool to measure insulin-like peptide 2 (Ilp2) levels in the fruit fly. The system allowed sensitive quantification of circulating Ilp2, including measures of Ilp 2 dynamics during fasting-feeding, and demonstration of adaptive Ilp1 secretion in response to insulin receptor haploinsufficiency. Tissue specific dissection of reduced insulin signaling phenotype revealed a critical role for insulin signaling in specific peripheral tissues. Knockdown of Drosrophila orthologues of human T2 DM risk genes, including GLIS3 and BCL11A, revealed roles for Drosphila genes in Ilp3 production and secretion. Discovery of the mechanisms of regulators controlling in vivo insulin dynamics will accelerate functional dissection and diabetes genetics.",0.5073907971382141
"Cuticular lipids are found in insects that function as pheromones to communicate information about age, sex, and reproductive status. In Drosophila, the composition of the information-rich lipid profile is dynamic and changes over the lifetime of an individual. However, the molecular basis of this change is not understood. To identify genes that control cuticular lipid production in D. elegans, we performed an RNA interference screen and Direct Analysis of Real Time gas chromatography mass spectrometry to quantify changes in chemical profiles. We identified a putative gene that encodes the putative steroid dehydrogenase sex- and age-dependent effects on viability, reproductive status, and oenocyte survival. Transcriptional silencing of overexpression of spidey during embryonic development results in pupal lethality and significant changes in levels of the ecdysone metabolite 20-hydroxyecdysonic acid 20- hydroxyecdysone. In contrast, inhibiting gene expression in adulthood resulted in striking loss of cuticular hydrocarbons, desiccation resistance, and lifespan. Oenocyte loss and cuticular lipid levels were partially rescued by 20-hygienic acid supplementation. Taken together, our results identify a novel regulator of pheromerone synthesis and reveal that ecdysteroid signaling is essential for the maintenance of cuticle lipids in oenocytes in adulthood.",0.5073907971382141
"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a neglected tropical disease with a high fatality rate reported in many countries. The first case of CCHF in Oman was detected in 1995 and serosurveys suggested widespread infection in humans and livestock in the country. Cases of the disease were reported in the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Oman between 1995 and 2017 retrospectively reviewed. Diagnosis was confirmed by serology and/or molecular tests in Oman. Stored RNA and recent cases were studied using sequencing of the complete open reading frame (ORF) viral S segment from Public Health England, enabling phylogenetic comparisons of S segments strains obtained from the region. In 2011–2017, the incidence steadily increased 19 (23.8%) from 80 cases clustered in Eid Al Adha. The median age was 33 (15–68) years and 79 (90%) male. The major risk of infection was contact with animals, or butchering 73/88 (83%) case related to tick bites. Severe cases-represented: 64 (72.7%) platelet count <50 x 109/L 32 (36.4%) died. The intrafamilial spread of healthcare-associated infection was a major concern in this country. Preventive measures should be introduced to reduce the risks of transmission to animal handlers and butchers and maintain safety in healthcare settings.",0.5073907971382141
"Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes a wide range of diseases, including malaria, typhoid fever, and diabetes. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and is the main cause of death in the developing world. In this study, we identified a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, TbMCP14, as a prime candidate for mediating the action of a group of anti-parasitic choline analogs. Depletion of TbmCP14 inducible in the bloodstream and procyclic forms increased resistance to these compounds 7-fold and 3-fold, respectively, compared to uninduced cells. In addition, the loss of the TbMP14 in-regulation of the bloodstream form of mitochondria resulted in a drug-induced decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, the depletion of the parasite-expressing procytic forms increased parasite susceptibility by 13-fold. Metabolomic analyses of parasites-expressed TbMsCP14 showed increased levels of the proline metabolite, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, suggesting a possible involvement of T.bMcp14 in energy production. These findings indicate that TbBMCP 14 is involved in energy and energy production in T. bruceis.",0.5073907971382141
"Gene co-expression networks are a method to look at large-scale transcriptional changes in aging. We have derived synonymous gene co- expression networks from AGEMAP expression data from 16-month-old and 24-month old mice. We identified a number of functional gene groups that change their expression in age and found a trend of declining correlation with age. In particular, we identified potential transcriptional mechanisms that may aid in modular correlation decline. We found computationally identified targets of NF-κB transcription factor decrease expression correlation at age. Finally, we found that genes prone to declining co-expressions tend to be co- located on the chromosome. These results indicate that transcription factors relating to chromosome domains and specific transcription factors may contribute to the decline.",0.5073907971382141
"In eukaryotic cells, there are numerous intra- and inter-chromomal interactions that regulate gene expression. However, the extent of these interactions is not clear. We developed a medium-throughput assay to screen for functional long-distance interactions that affect the average expression level of reporter gene cell-to-cell variability (noise). We found that the MET3 promoter (MET3pr) is flanked by ~1 kb invariable sequences of thousands of genomic loci, allowing contacts between different parts of the genome. Changes in MET3pr activity in a case necessarily involve mechanisms of function at distance. In a case, the locations, which deviate from the norm exhibit distinct patterns including low expression/high noise, low-expression/low noise, high expression/noise, and 3D clustering. We provide evidence that clustering occurs in the native genome and enhances transcription of endogenous Met4-target genes. Overall, our results demonstrate that only a small fraction of long-range chromosomal interactions affect gene expression in yeast.",0.5073907971382141
"Mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits important human arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses. A large genome containing repetitive sequences, resulted in the genome being poorly assembled — 4,758 scaffolds, assigned to each chromosome. To allow mapping genes affecting disease transmission, we improved genome assembly by scoring a large number of SNPs from recombinant progeny of cross strains of Ae. aedes. We found that a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, for example, sequences from different chromosomes were found in the same scaffold. We also found that large regions of the genome that are suppressed by recombination, centromeres, extend to 47% of the chromosome. These results illustrate the utility of new genome assembly, and provide a list of candidate genes affecting the trait.",0.5073907971382141
"Leptospirosis is an important neglected bacterial zoonosis that is largely overlooked in Africa. In this systematic review, we aimed to compare current knowledge about the geographic distribution, prevalence, incidence and diversity of acute human leptospisrosis in Africa with the prevalence of Leptospira spp. infection in animal hosts of Africa. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched for studies described (1) acute and pathogenic infections in African animals. We found 97 studies described in African literature published between January 1930 and October 2014. These studies met pre-defined inclusion criteria and strict case definitions. We identified 97 studies that described acute and disease in Africa, including animal and human Leptococcus infection (n = 46) and animal Leptopira infection ( n = 51) in 26 African countries. Incidence estimates were largely restricted to Indian Ocean islands (3 101 cases per 100,000 year) and Tanzania. Data from Tanzania indicate that human disease incidence is high on mainland Africa (75 102 cases per100,000 per year). The major species (L. borgpetersenii, L. interrogans and L. kirschneri) are predominant reports in Africa isolates from a diverse range of serogroups reported in human animal infections. Cattle appear to be important hosts of a large number of LePTospira serogroup in Africa and data available will allow comparison of the Leptobacterium infection linked to human animal populations.",0.5073907971382141
"The fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola is a pathogen that infects wheat and grasses. It was first discovered in the Fertile Crescent region of North America about 10,000–12,000 years ago. The wheat-infecting lineage emerged as closely related to Mycophaerella pathogens infecting wild grasses, but the divergence of the pathogen and its closest known progenitor species is named M. Graminicola S1. The genome of S1 was obtained using Illumina sequencing resulting in 35 Mb draft genome sequence 32X. Assembled contigs aligned with previously sequenced M. graminicol genome, the alignment covered >90% of the non- repetitive portion of the M. species genome, with an average divergence of 7%. We found that structural rearrangements significantly affected the number of essential chromosomes plus the proportion of syntenic chromosomes. At the nucleotide level, essential chromosomes evolved differently. The average synonymous substitution rate for dispensable chromosomes was considerably lower than for essential chromosomes, and the average non-synonymous substitution rate was three times higher. Differences in molecular evolution related to different transmission and recombination patterns, differences in effective population sizes, and differences in the effective population size of essential and dispensable chromosome. In order to identify genes potentially involved in host specialization speciation, we calculated the ratios of synonymous and non- synonymous substitution rates to >9,500 aligned protein coding genes. We identified 43 candidate genes showing evidence of positive selection, encoding a potential pathogen effector protein. We conclude that divergence of pathogens is accompanied by structural changes in the genome structure and that positive selection may present a small number of protein coding gene.",0.5073907971382141
"RNA recognition motif (RRM) is a common RNA binding domain in eukaryotic proteins. It is of great value to engineer the specificity of target RNAs to arbitrary sequence. In the recently achieved RRM of the Rbfox protein, mutations in R118D, E147R, N151S, and E152 T were designed to target the precursor oncogenic miRNA 21b. However, a variety of molecular dynamics-based approaches have been developed to predict specific interactions between the binding site and the binding interface. Overall, we have run approximately 50 microseconds of enhanced sampling of plain molecular dynamics simulations and engineered a complex of wild-type RbFox·pre-miRNA 20b mutated systems. Comparison of available NMR data with wild type molecules (protein, RNA, complex) served to establish the accuracy of the calculations. Free energy calculations suggest improvements in affinity selectivity achieved by the S151 T replacement.",0.5073907971382141
"Enterobacterial species, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, express horizontally acquired genes with higher average content than those repressed by the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS. The classical example of H- NS is the repressed locus bgl (aryl-β, D-glucoside) operon of E. coli. The locus is “ cryptic,” and laboratory growth conditions are known to relieve the repression of bgl by H-Nucleoside. However, repression is relieved by spontaneous mutations. Here, we investigated the phylogeny of the bgl operon. Typing bgl from a representative collection of bacteria from the genus Enterobacterium revealed that it evolved in clonally present strains from three phylogenetic groups, B1, B2, and presumably replaced a cluster of ORFans in the phylogenetic group D. Interestingly, bgl was mutated in 20% of strains from the two groups, suggesting a functional role for bgl in the extraintestinal pathogenic bacteria.",0.5073907971382141
"Maternally inherited intracellular bacteria Wolbachia manipulate host reproduction in ways that foster frequency and increases in host populations. Manipulations involving cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) are common in arthropods that produce non-viable embryos. CI is associated with the spread of a Wolbachiae variant wRi in Californian populations of Drosophila simulans, interpreted as a bistable wave, and local infection frequencies tend to increase when infection is sufficiently common to offset imperfect maternal transmission and infection costs. We describe the sequential spread of two Wolbachias variants (wRi and wAu) in natural populations from the east coast of Australia, which causes significant CI, with wRI displacing wAU 2004. We also describe the dynamics of the earlier spread in California, best understood by Fisherian waves and favourable variants, and suggest that local spread tends to occur arbitrarily low frequencies.",0.5073907971382141
"Congenital Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium T. cruzi. The disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito and is transmitted to the lungs by the bites of infected infants. Current programs to detect congenital chagas in Latin America utilize microscopy and early life serology at 6 months. However, these programs suffer low sensitivity and high loss of follow-up in infancy. We developed a ChagAS urine nanoparticle test (Chagap) to concentrate, preserve, and detect T.cruzi antigens in urine early, and non-invasive diagnosis of congenital disease. We demonstrate that Chagap is a simple and sensitive test for the early diagnosis and early detection of congenitally infected infants in the urine. We also demonstrate that chagap sensitivity is 96.5% (71/74 endemic, 12/12 non-endemic specimens). This is comparable to PCR specimens at 0 1 month (91.3%) and significantly higher microscopy specimens at 16.42%–57.26%. Our results suggest that changap could be developed as a simple, sensitive test to early diagnosis for congenital and noninvasive Chagass disease.",0.5121560096740723
"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) persists as a global virus-specific T-cell dysfunction, and T-cells have been shown to play an important role in clinical outcomes. To determine whether circulating γδT-cells altered HBV infection relative to clinical status, we examined the frequency, phenotype, and function of peripheral blood Vδ1+ and δ2+α+β-cells in a clinically diverse North American cohort of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and acute hepatitis B, uninfected and control subjects. We found that circulating αβ-γ-β-β cells were associated with increased TbethiEomesdim and Tbet/Eomesd expression, and increased Tbet and EomesD expression. Furthermore, we found that IFNγ/TNF responses were inversely correlated with serum ALT and HBV DNA levels. These findings suggest that circulating β-γ/β-α-β T cells may be distinct from circulating α β-ββ-κ-β–β-δα-γδβ cells in acute chronic HBV infections.",0.5121560096740723
"Francisella tularensis (Ft) causes frequently fatal, acute necrotic pneumonia in humans and animals. Following lethal Ft infection in mice, infiltration of the lungs predominantly into immature myeloid cells is elicited and the pathogenesis of host mortality. However, following a sub-lethal Ft challenge, mature myeloids elicited protective protection. In addition, inflammasome-dependent IL-1β and IL-18 are important for protection. Nlrp3 appears to be dispensable for resistance to infection with the virulent Type B live vaccine strain LVS. In vitro macrophage and in vivo IL and 1β and I-18 responses to Ft in LVS and SchuS4 deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to infection. In this study, we show that in the absence of NlrP3, Ft infected mice dramatically reduced lung pathology, diminished recruitment of death and immature myelinoid cells, and reduced bacterial burden in comparison to wildtype inflammaome-deficient mice. Moreover, increased numbers of mature neutrophils appear in the lung early after lethal vs. Ft infection and in N.l.p3 deficient mice. Finally, Ft infection induces myeloidal lung stromal cell death, which requires Nlrpp3, which drives host mortality and contributes to host morbidity.",0.5121560096740723
"Dopamine is thought to directly influence the neurophysiological mechanisms of performance monitoring and cognitive control— processes critically linked to the production of adapted behaviour. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that changing dopamine levels in the frontal cortex may modify neurophysiology mechanisms of markers of frontal cortex, which in turn leads to cognitive changes. This causal chain needs to be verified. We use longitudinal recordings of frontal neurophysiologic markers for months after a progressive dopaminergic lesion in non-human primates, and provide data that fail to support the simple interaction between dopamine, frontal function, and cognition. Feedback potentials, performance-monitoring signals thought to drive successful control, ceased to differentiate between feedback valence at the end of lesion, and the clinical motor threshold. In contrast, cognitive control performance was driven by oscillatory markers of cognitive control unimpaired by the lesion. These results suggest a complex non-linear set of mechanisms engaged in the brain response to the progressive dopamine lesion and suggest that the direct causal chain of dopamine and frontal physiology is not directly predictive of dopamine loss.",0.5121560096740723
"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) interactions with myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) result in virus dissemination to CD4+ T cells via a trans infection pathway dependent on virion incorporation into the host cell derived from glycosphingolipid (GSL) and GM3. The mechanism of DC-mediated HIV-1 trans infection is extremely efficacious and result in infection of multiple CD4 + T cells and exploratory contacts on the DC surface. However, the mechanism of how DCs activate the type I IFN signaling pathway dramatically enhances HIV-mediated T cell trans infection remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the type IFN-inducible Siglec-1, CD169, DC receptor captures HIV in a GM3-dependent manner. Selective downregulation of CD169 expression, neutralizing CD169 function, depletion of GSLs virions, abrogated DC-dependent HIV-infection and trans infection, and exogenous expression of the CD169 receptor- naïve cells rescued the GSL-dependent capture of trans infection. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of pathogen parasitization by the host encoded cellular recognition machinery (GM3–CD169 interaction) and DC-independent HIV dissemination.",0.5121560096740723
"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by infection with Leishmania donovani complex, remains a major public health problem in endemic regions of South Asia, East Africa, and Brazil. Rapid field diagnosis relies principally on the demonstration of anti-Leishmania antibodies against clinically suspect cases. The rK39 immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is based on a fragment of a kinesin-related gene derived from Brazilian L. chagasi, and recognised by L. infantum, originating from Europe. Despite the reliability of the RDT, it has been reported to have lower sensitivity in East Africa. The reason for this differential response may reside in the molecular diversity of the sequences in East African and South Asian strains. Coding sequences of the rk39 homologues from East African L. donovan strains were amplified and amplified and compared to genomic DNA, and analysed the diversity of these sequences. East African sequences revealed significant diversity in the rK40 sequence, with multiple substitutions involving charge changes, amino acid substitutions and 3′ half repeats conservative. Specific polymorphisms were found in South Asian and East African strains. Diversity in HASPB1 and HASPB2 gene repeat sequences, flank sequences and the Kinesin homologue of the synthetic antigen rK28 designed to reduce variable RDT performance, was investigated. Non-canonical combination repeat arrangements were revealed to be responsible for the differences in the kinesins in strains producing unpredicted size amplicons. This study provides new insights into the molecular and genetic diversity of strains from East Africa to East Africa and South Asia and highlights the importance of targeted comparative genomics guiding optimisation of recombinant/synthetic diagnostic antigens.",0.5121560096740723
"Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic ulcer caused by a parasitic disease caused by the bacterium Buruli, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito. The disease is endemic in many parts of the world, including Africa and the Middle East. In Benin, there is a shortage of medical anthropologists working in field health service policy planning. In this paper, we describe a pioneering attempt to establish a therapeutic community for patients suffering from BU and chronic ulcers requiring long term hospital care in Benin. The project was designed and implemented by a team of social scientists working in concert with the current previous director of the hospital. Qualitative research initially investigated patients’ understanding of illness and treatment, identified questions about their treatment status after hospitalization, ascertained the level of social support and developed a series of open forums. Following hospital wide education sessions, open forums were held during the week to provide opportunity for patients and hospital staff to express concerns and render sources of discontent transparent. Patient group representatives met with hospital staff and problem solve issues in a non- confrontational manner. Psychosocial support for individual patients was provided and a second intervention took form. Patients with ulcers unrelated to BU questioned BU patients receiving preferential treatment, given special medicines, charged care. The idea of subsidized treatment for the disease was hard to justify, especially given the fact that BU is contagious. The pilot project illustrates basic principles necessary for transforming long term residential hospitals into therapeutic communities.",0.5121560096740723
"In response to replication stress, cells activate the intra-S checkpoint, induce DNA repair pathways, increase nucleotide levels, and inhibit origin firing. Here, we report that Rrm3 associates with a subset of replication origins and controls DNA synthesis during replication stress. The N-terminal domain required for DNA synthesis maps to residues 186–212 and is critical for the binding of the Orc5 origin recognition complex. Deletion of this domain by lethal cells lacking the replication checkpoint mediator Mrc1 leads to mutations in the replication stressor hydroxyurea. Our findings suggest that the role of Rr3, an Orc5-binding domain, in restricting DNA synthesis is independent of the established role of ATPase/ helicase facilitating replication fork progression and polymerase blocking obstacles.",0.5121560096740723
"Trypanosoma brucei (T.b. rhodesiense) is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in eastern and southern African countries. There is evidence of diversity in the disease progression and progression of the disease in different countries. HAT in Malawi is associated with chronic haemo-lymphatic stage infection compared to countries, Uganda, which are associated with acute and marked neurological impairment. This study raises the question of the role of host genetic factors in infection outcomes. We conducted a candidate gene association study involving 202 subjects, 70 cases and 132 controls in the northern region of Malawi. Ninety-one genes were genotyped from 17 genes: IL10, IL8, IL4, HLA-G, TNFA, APOL, IFNG, IL1B, IL2R, IL12B, and IL12R, HP, HPR, CFH, and CFH. We found a strong association between the APOL1 and G2 allele (p = 0.0000105,=0.14, CI95 = [0.05–0.41], BONF =0.00068) indicating that carriers of the G2 variant were protected against T.b., rhodesense HAT. The SNP rs2069845 and IL6 raw p < 0.05, remain significant for the Bonferroni correction. These associations were found in 15 candidate genes. Our finding confirms the results of studies that have shown that the G1 variant of APOL 1 is also associated with protection against T., r. r., and hAT.",0.5121560096740723
"Infection with Plasmodium vivax results in strong activation of monocytes, important components of the systemic inflammatory response to parasite control. The overall goal of this study was to define the role of monocyte activation in P. vivx malaria. We found that monocytes are the primary source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and that they expressed the highest levels of activation markers, which included chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules. Morphologically, CD14+ differentiated from CD14lo monocytes displaying larger active mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that CD14− differentiated from the CD14-CD16+ monocytes by displaying a larger number of mitochondria and efficient phagocytizing of infected reticulocytes, induced by high levels of intracellular TNF-α and reactive oxygen species. Importantly, antibodies specific to ICAM-1, PECAM-2 and LFA-1 efficiently blocked the pathogenocytosis of infected monocytes. These results provide a key information about the mechanism by which monocytes activate the innate immune response and the role played by monocytes in malaria control.",0.5121560096740723
"Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is a parasitic disease caused by the parasite Leishmania braziliensis and L. amazonensis. In this study, we used THP-1-derived macrophages infected with Leishmannia (Viannia) brazilensis, L. (Leishmania) amazonis to investigate the role of IL-32 in the host defense against the parasite. We found that the presence of the cytokine interleukin-32 (IL-32γ) is dependent on endogenous TNFα and IL-8. Remarkably, the infection index was augmented in the absence of the IL-33γ and decreased cells overexpressing the inflammatory cytokine. Mechanistically, these effects are explained by nitric oxide cathelicidin and β-defensin 2 production. Thus, endogenous IL-2 is a crucial cytokine involved in host defense of Leishmia parasites.",0.5121560096740723
"The molecular structure of spectrin is poorly understood. In this study, we combine previously reported biochemical and high-resolution crystallographic data with structural mass spectroscopy and electron microscopic data to derive a detailed, experimentally-supported quaternary structure of the spectrin heterotetramer. In addition to explaining spectrin physiological resting length ~55-65 nm, our model provides a mechanism for spectrin to undergo a seamless-fold extension of the remaining linear filament, an experimentally observed property. Our proposed model is similar to the Chinese Finger Trap: shorter molecular lengths in spectrin hollow cylinder extend by increasing the pitch of a spectrin repeat, decreases the internal diameter, and decreases its internal diameter. Our model is supported by zero-length chemical crosslink data and is indicative of approximately 90 degree bend of adjacent spectrin repeats. The domain-domain interactions model is entirely consistent with the present prototypical linear antiparallel heterosetramer and recently reported inter-strand chemical crosslinks. The model is consistent with known physical properties and spectrin, and the extension of this Chinese Finger trap Model reduces the ~180-200 nm molecular model currently common use.",0.5121560096740723
"In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the promotion of longevity by the transcription factor DAF-16 requires reduced insulin/IGF receptor (IIR) signaling ablation in the germline, a reason for its negative impact on germ cells is unknown. Here, we show that somatic expression of DAF–16 in germ cells inhibits germline proliferation in daf-2 mutants of gld-1 tumors. In contrast to the somatic function of the tumor suppressor FOXO/DAF-15, the presence of IIR signaling does not result in tumorigenic activity, but counteracts robust lifespan extension. We also show that the cell-autonomous role of FOXO-16 in stem cell proliferation results in hyperplasia and germline disruption in the surrounding basement membrane. Our data suggest that the functional balance between DAF and IIR activities in different tissues determines longevity.",0.5121560096740723
"Rhodococcus opacus PD630 and Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 bioconvert to a diverse range of organic substrates, including triacylglycerols (TAGs). To describe the genetic basis of Rhodococococcus oleaginous metabolism, we sequenced and performed a comparative analysis of 9.27 Mb of the R. opacus and PD630 genome. Metabolic-reassessment and gene family analysis identified 261 genes implicated in Rhodococci oleaginy. We identified uncommon straight-chain odd-carbon fatty acids with high abundance stores of TAGs and high abundance of cis-heptadecenoic acids. We also identified pentadecanoic, heptadecaenoic, and cis-Heptadecanenoic acid as bioconversion pathways, and screened for R. opsacus, Ralstonia eutropha H16, C. glutamicum 13032 growth and 190 compounds. The results of the catabolic screen, phylogenetic analysis and TAGs cycle enzymes, and metabolic product characterizations are integrated into a working model of prokaryotic oleagyiny.",0.5121560096740723
"Mutations are critical drivers of cancer initiation and cancer recurrence. While extensive studies have focused on exposure-induced mutations, studies have explored the importance of tissue physiology as a modulator of mutation susceptibility in vivo. In particular, inflammation, a known cancer risk factor, is relevant for chronic inflammatory diseases and pathogen-induced inflammation. In this study, fluorescent yellow direct repeat (FYDR) mice harbor a reporter to detect misalignments in homologous recombination (HR), an important class of mutations. In FYDR mice exposed to cerulein, a potent inducer of pancreatic inflammation, inflammation induces DSBs (γH2AX foci) that days later increase cell proliferation. In isolated bouts of inflammation induce HR, overlap between inflammation-induced DNA damage and inflammation- induced cell proliferation induced HR significantly. In addition, in animals exposed to methylnitrosourea, a model alkylating agent that creates DNA lesions relevant to environmental exposures to cancer chemotherapy, we found that exposure to alkylation damage induces HR, but importantly, inflammation-mediated cell proliferation and inflammation induced HR are synergistic in a synergistic fashion. Taken together, our results demonstrate that acute bout of inflammation, which is a kinetic barrier separating DNA damage from cell proliferation, protects mutations from exposure to inflammation.",0.5121560096740723
"MicroRNAs are short, noncoding RNAs that play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Although the functions of microRNAs in plants and animals have been revealed in recent years, the transcriptional mechanism of microRNA genes is still poorly understood. To elucidate the regulation of these genes, we have developed a novel promoter prediction method, called common query voting (CoVote), to identify the putative core promoters of known microRNA gene model species. Using this method, we identify putative promoter motifs of the promoters of the genes in the model species and characterize the sequence of these motifs. We discover significant, characteristic sequence motifs in the core promoters, which match closely with known cis-acting elements of transcription initiation. These motifs are conserved in different species specific microRNA and individual species.",0.5121560096740723
"Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. In Ecuador, ivermectin is used as a mass drug for the control of onchocerciasis. We conducted retrospective analysis of data collected from five surveys conducted in the Esmeraldas (Ecuador) region between 1990 and 2013. We found that the prevalence of the parasite T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides hookworms was significantly reduced in the areas covered by the drug. We also found that in areas where the drug was distributed, the prevalence was significantly lower than in areas that were not covered. This suggests that the drug may have a significant impact on the prevalence and pathogenicity of the parasitic worm, trichuriasis.",0.5121560096740723
"Learning rules, spike-timers-dependent plasticity (STDP), change the structure of networks of neurons based on firing activity. Previous studies have shown that STDP selectively potentiates feed-forward connections to specific axonal delays, which underlies behavioral functions in the auditory brainstem and barn owl. In this study, we investigate how STDP leads to selective potentiation of recurrent connections to different axonal dendritic delays and oscillatory activity. We develop analytical models of learning additive STDP recurrent networks driven by oscillatory inputs, which support the results of simulations of leaky integrate-to-fire neurons. In addition, we show that the selective modulation of the amplitude of the oscillatory response frequency can lead to selective amplitude of oscillatory responses in a single recurrent network. Finally, we extend our model of axonal delay selection to a range of axons and dendrites. These results support the application of models of the formation of activation in neuronal ensembles in the cortex, missing the fundamental pitch perception in the sensory brainstem.",0.5121560096740723
"HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is characterized by high frequencies of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid production of proinflammatory cytokines, which contribute to central nervous system inflammation in HTLV-infected patients. However, little is known about the differences in CD8+ T cell activation status in asymptomatic carrier (ACs) and patients with HAM /TSP. Here, we show that CD244, a signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family receptor, is significantly higher in CD4+ T cells in CD244-infecting patients, ACs in HAM/TPS, and healthy normal donors (NDs). Blockade of CD244 inhibited degranulation of IFN-γ and production of CD8 + T cells from patients in HAM and TSP, suggesting CD244 is associated with effector functions in both patients and HAM/TSSP. Furthermore, we found that the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) was overexpressed in patients and CD244 expression was associated with CD4-specific DNA loads and frequency in cells from HTLV infected patients. These findings suggest that the CD244/SAP pathway may be involved in the active regulation of the CD8-T cells in patients of HAM/PTSP, and may play roles in promoting inflammatory neurological disease.",0.5121560096740723
"Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted by phlebotomine flies. Currently, systemic insecticides for dogs are registered in a zoo-anthropophilic pool of blood feeding phlebocytes. To predict the impact of community-wide use of systemic insecticide in dog populations as a public health measure to control transmission of Leishmann infantum in humans, we developed a mathematical model to describe the transmission dynamics of L. infantum to dogs, vectorial capacity and term to represent transmission dynamics in dogs. Infected () dogs levels of infectiousness were modelled, high infectiousness and low infectiousness. Human incidence was estimated by the relationship between the infection and the dog population. We evaluated the outcomes of a wide range of scenarios comprising different combinations of initial insecticide efficacy, duration of insecticide coverage, and the proportion of dog population treated (60%, 70% & 80%). The reduction in human infection incidence was achieved by different combinations in terms of the insecticide duration and duration of dog coverage. Our results show that systemic insecticidal efficacy is 80% at 6 months and 65% efficacy require treating 70% of dogs to reduce human infections incidence by 50%.",0.5121560096740723
"Bubonic plague is the most common zoonosis in the world, but the factors responsible for persistence of the highly virulent disease remain poorly understood. Classically, endemic persistence of plague is suspected to be due to coexistence of plague resistant plague susceptible rodents in natural foci, and/or metapopulation structure of reservoirs. Here, we analyse the dynamics of plague propagation in Madagascar, a major focus of the disease endemic in the 1920s and central highlands. By combining deterministic and stochastic analyses, we show that endemicity is favoured by intermediate host population sizes, (i) large host populations, and (ii) the presence of resistant host populations account for plague endemicity, thanks to subdivision and subsequent reduction of size subpopulations, and the extinction- recolonization dynamics of disease. In light of these results, we suggest scenarios that explain the localized presence of plague in Madagascar.",0.5121560096740723
"Categorization is an important cognitive process in humans. However, it has been extensively studied in vision, and the analogous phenomenon of audition has been systematically explored. In this study, we test whether human subjects learn to use category distributions prior to making auditory-category decisions. We asked subjects to classify the frequency of tone burst in overlapping, uniform categories according to perceived tone frequency. We systematically varied the prior probability presenting tone burst frequency from originating versus category. We found that subjects learned changes in prior probabilities in early testing information that influence categorization behavior. We also tested subject average behavior and found that variations in the Bayesian model led to optimal sub-optimal decision behavior (i.e. probability matching). We also found that probability matching provided a better account of human decision behavior. Finally, we systematically explored potential ways that additional noise sources may influence categorizing behavior. Our work extends previous findings in the auditory domain and reformulates the issue of categorization in a manner that can help interpret the results of previous research in a generative framework.",0.5121560096740723
"In order to suppress microbial outgrowth, the host sequesters essential nutrients through a process termed nutritional immunity. However, inflammatory responses to bacterial insult can restore nutritional resources. Given that nutrient availability modulates the virulence factor production of biofilm formation in bacterial species, it is hypothesized that fluctuations in heme-iron availability, particularly at privileged sites, may similarly influence Haemophilus biofilm development and pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that heme–iron restriction can promote biofilm growth and persistence in the presence of a variety of pathogenic phenotypes. We show that prior heme iron restriction potentiates biofilm changes that include increased peak height and architectural complexity compared to biofilms initiated by heme and replete bacteria, suggesting a mechanism by which epigenetic responses participate in the changes observed. Additionally, we show that in a co-infection model of human otitis media, we found that when heme was restricted to Haemphilus, accounting for 10% of the inoculum (90% heme-, replete) and represented 99% of organisms recovered within 4 days. Taken together, these data suggest that nutritional immunity, in fact, can foster long-term phenotypic changes that better equip bacteria for survival at infectious sites.",0.5121560096740723
"Bacillus subtilis is a Gram negative bacterium that has been identified as a negative regulator of competence development. It controls expression of genes related to competence. We found that Rok binds to extended regions of the B. subtila genome. These regions are characterized by high A+T content and are believed to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Rok binding regions are known to be mobile genetic elements. We also found that deletion of rok resulted in a higher excision element, ICEBs1, in the genome. We identified a conserved C-terminal region of Rok that may have contributed to this association. Our previous work suggests that the Rok nucleoid associated protein serves to repress the expression of A-T-rich genes, which appear to have acquired through horizontal gene transfers. In other ways, Rok appears to be functionally analogous to H-NS, a nucleoid-associated protein found in Gram negative bacteria and Lsr2 in high G+C Mycobacteria.",0.5121560096740723
"Esophageal cancer is caused by squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma. ESCCs comprise 90% of cases worldwide, and recur 15% to 15% of the year survival rate despite the available treatments. The identification of new ESCC drivers and therapeutic targets is critical for improving outcomes. We report that the expression of a human DEK oncogene is strongly upregulated in esophagesal SCC based on data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). The DEK chromatin-associated protein plays important roles in many nuclear processes including gene transcription, epigenetics, DNA repair, and DNA repair. Our previous data utilized a murine knockout model to demonstrate that Dek overexpression in human keratinocytes, the cell origin of SCC, is sufficient to cause hyperplasia in 3D organotypic raft cultures that mimic human skin, linking high DEK expression to keratinocyte oncogenic phenotypes. However, the role of DEK-expression in ESCC development remains unknown in human cells and genetic mouse models. In order to define the consequences of Dek overexression in vivo, we generated a validated tetracycline responsive Dek transgenic mouse model referred to Bi-L-Dek. We show that high Dek expression induced a trend of hyperplasticity in the 3D raft cultures of human skin. Furthermore, high levels of Dek expression in keratin cells were associated with the trend of esophageaal hyperplasia in 4NQO treated mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate that high levels in Dek in cell origin and SCC are sufficient to promote the development of ESCC in vivo.",0.5121560096740723
"Bacterial bloodstream infection (BSI) is one of the leading causes of death in critically ill patients and accurate diagnosis is crucial. In this study, we report a 16S metagenomics approach for diagnosing and understanding bBSI. The proof-of-concept was delivered to 75 children with severe febrile illness in Burkina Faso. Standard blood culture malaria testing was conducted at the time of hospital admission. We used 16S to duplicate blood from the patients. We found that patients with acute malaria were 7-fold more at risk of presenting polymicrobial bloodstream infections compared to patients with recent malaria diagnosis (p-value = 0.046). Malaria is known to affect epithelial gut function and facilitate bacterial translocation into the intestinal lumen and blood. Importantly, patients with polymicrobacterial blood infections showed a 9-fold higher risk factor for surviving febriole illness. Our data demonstrate that 16S is a powerful approach for diagnosis and understanding the nature of BBSI and show that appropriate control samples are crucial to detect background signals of environmental contamination.",0.5121560096740723
"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease that affects more than 14 million people worldwide. The World Health Organization Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GFP) aims to reduce LF by providing care to persons who suffer from clinical manifestations, including lymphedema —-called morbidity management and disability prevention (MMDP). Scaling MMDP is slow, and lack of consensus on the effectiveness of recommended hygiene-based interventions for clinical lymphingema. We conducted a systemic review of meta-analysis to estimate the effectiveness and effectiveness of hygiene-related interventions for LF-associated morbidity and disability in LF-endemic areas. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, ISI Web Knowledge, MedCarib, Lilacs, REPIDISCA, DESASTRES, and African Index Medicus databases from March 23, 2015 to date. We found that there was a lower incidence of acute dermatolymphagioadenitis (ADLA), (2) a lower percentage of patients reporting episode of ADLA follow-up, and (3) clinical outcomes were assessed comparable to those of other interventions for lympedema management. These findings highlight the potential of these interventions to significantly reduce LF-related morbidity, disability, and disability.",0.5121560096740723
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing acute chronic infections in susceptible hosts. Chronic infections are thought to be caused by bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are highly structured, multicellular, microbial communities encased in the extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival of the host. The aim of this research was to develop an animal model to allow in vivo study of P. aeruginia biofilm infections in the Drosophila melanogaster host. We found that P. auberculosis-causing bacterium, PAO1, was significantly more virulent than PAZHI3, and that the hyperbiofilm strain (PAO1) was more likely to survive in infected flies on day 14 postinfection. Biofilm formation was dependent on the expression of pel exopolysaccharide genes, and the pelB::lux mutant failed to form biofilmms. Our results highlight the importance of the use of the animal model in the understanding of the pathogen interactions between P. Auberculosis and the host and highlight the potential of this model to be used in the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of chronic infections.",0.5121560096740723
"Undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) is one of the most common reasons for people seeking healthcare in low-income countries. UFI is often associated with haemorrhage and high case fatality rates (CFR). A number of high consequence infectious diseases, including Ebola virus, are endemic in the Federal Republic of Sudan. In 2015/2016, 594 cases and 108 deaths were reported. The aetiology of these outbreaks remains unknown. In this retrospective cohort study, a subset of 65 263 outbreak samples received from the National Public Health Laboratory met selection criteria for sufficient sample volume and epidemiological data. Clinical features included fever (95.8%), bleeding, headache (51.6%) and arthralgia (42.2%). The epidemiological patterns were indicative of person-to-person transmission of health-worker cases reported. Samples tested from the Public Health England Rare Imported Pathogens Laboratory were tested with a bespoke panel of likely pathogens including haemorrrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses Rickettsia, Leptospira Borrelia spp. Seven (11%) of the samples were positive for Crimean-Congo haemoral fever virus (CCHFV) real-time reverse transcription PCR. The remaining samples tested negative for CCHFVs. Prospective studies are needed to explore aetiologies, including novel pathogens.",0.5121560096740723
"The insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway plays key roles in growth, metabolism, stress resistance, reproduction, and longevity in diverse organisms including mammals. Invertebrate genomes contain multiple genes encoding insulin-like ligands, including seven Drosophila insulin-Like peptides (DILPs). We investigated the evolution, diversification, redundancy, and functions of DILPs, combining evolutionary analysis, based on newly-generated knock-down of 7 dilp genes in D. melanogaster, and functional analysis. Diversification of 7 DILP genes preceded diversification of D. species, suggesting a stable gene diversification and family membership, suggesting stabilising selection and gene function. Gene knock-outs demonstrated synergy between gene expression and expression of different DILp genes, notably DilP3 required for normal expression of the two 5 brain neurosecretory cells. Loss of the loss of the brain genes resulted in increased lifespan, but loss of these genes did not affect fertility, contrary to the proposed role of Drososymbiontic bacterium Wolbachia in lifespan regulation. Importantly, loss of brain genes produced in the brain greatly extended lifespan in the presence of endosysymbiosis and the pathogenesis of the bacterium, demonstrating a specific interaction between IIS and Wolbachiae lifespan regulation, suggesting that IIS extends lifespan mechanisms that overlap DR.",0.5121560096740723
"Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a group of unicellular, flagellated parasites responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. The parasite is responsible for a large number of organelle remodelling, which occurs during the life cycle of the parasite and is accompanied by major changes in morphology and organelle positioning. The flagella originates from the basal bodies of the cell body and exits from cell body to the flagelar pocket (FP). The FP is attached to the cell surface flagesllum attachment zone (FAZ) and is the sole site of endo-exocytosis. The FAZ contains a large complex of cytoskeletal proteins, plus an intracellular set of specialised microtubules (MtQ) that elongate basal bodies in the anterior end of cell. The distal end of the FP, which is essential for the parasite pathogenicity, is surrounded by a small, extracellular, cytoskeleton collar (FPC) that circumvents the flangellum. Overlapping of the FPC hook complex (HC) (a sub-structured structure previously named bilobe) is essential thought to be involved in protein FP entry. In this study, we identify a new BILBO1 partner protein, FPC4, as a co-factor of FPC, HC, and MtQ. Our data suggest that FPC and HC have a tripartite association.",0.5121560096740723
"The identification of a causal mutation is essential for molecular diagnosis and clinical management of genetic disorders. However, the use of next-generation exome sequencing has greatly improved the detection of nucleotide changes, but the biological interpretation of exonic variants remains challenging. In this study, we used a model system to assess the prevalence of RNA splicing mutations in MLH1, a gene implicated in hereditary cancer. We performed comprehensive minigene assays and analyzed patient RNA available. Our study revealed a staggering number of splicing mutation mutations affecting the splicing sites, including mutations directly affecting splicing at splice sites, particularly, mutations altering potential splicing regulatory elements (ESRs). Our results demonstrate the predictive power of 3 silico approaches that have recently been described as promising tools for pinpointing ESR-mutations.",0.5121560096740723
"C-MYC is a nuclear sequence specific –binding DNA-binding proteins that are pleiotropic regulators of cellular function. It has been deregulated and/or mutated in human cancers. Experimental studies of MYC binding to the genome have not been fully consistent. Here, we develop a computational model to predict c-myC binding sites in the human genome. We use a Bayesian network classifier to predict which genes are likely to be regulated by MYC in vivo. The classifier incorporates genomic sequence, experimentally determined genomic chromatin acetylation islands, and predicted methylation status in the computational model. We find that the predictions of the classifier are applicable to transcription factors, cAMP-response element-binding protein, and binding sites sensitive to DNA methylation. Second, our predictions are combined with gene expression profile data and independent microarray datasets from multiple tissues. Finally, we consider gene function annotations and Gene Ontology to predict the c-MYc targets. We assess the performance of our prediction results by comparing the results comparing c-Myc targets identified in the biomedical literature. Overall, we predict 460 likely c- MYC target genes to be expressed in the whole human genome, 67 reported to be bound to regulated MYC, 68 bound to MYC and 80 MYC-regulated. Our approach successfully identifies known c-MEC targets and suggests novel sites. Our findings suggest that we can identify c-mec genomic targets, and integration of different data sources helps improve accuracy.",0.49811267852783203
"Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, and the molecular basis of protection remains unclear. In this study, we report that dietary zinc levels dictate the outcome of bacterial infection in a murine model. Dietary zinc restriction impacts murine tissue zinc levels and distribution post-infection. In addition, the activation of murine phagocytic cells is affected by zinc restriction, and efficacy of bacterial control is compromised. We show that S. pneumoniaes is highly sensitive to zinc intoxication, and that this process is impaired in mice isolated from phagocytes. Collectively, our data suggest that zinc deficiency increases sensitivity to bacterial infection, revealing a role for zinc as a component of host antimicrobial defences.",0.49811267852783203
"Trypanosoma brucei is a parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans. It is transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse and is transmitted to mammalian hosts by bite of the infected parasite. Information on the parasite interactions between the salivary gland (SG) and the mammalian infective metacyclic (MC) parasites present in SG is sparse. We performed RNA-seq analyses of uninfected T. b. bruceI infected SGs from Glossina morsitans and morsitan. Comparison of SG transcriptomes with the body fly transcriptome revealed 2.7% of the contigs differentially expressed during SG infection, 263 contigs (0.6%) preferentially expressed in SGs (SG- enriched) and 27 SG-expressed contigs were suppressed from infected SG. The suppressed contigs accounted for 55% of SG transcripts, and included abundant putative secreted proteins and anti-hemostatic functions. In contrast, expression of putative host proteins associated with immunity, stress, cell division and tissue remodeling was enriched in infected SG, suggesting parasite infections induce host immune stress response(s) that likely results in tissue renewal and tissue renewal. Our study provides the foundation for molecular aspects of the trypanosome dialogue between tsetes and mammalian hosts, necessary for future functional investigations.",0.49811267852783203
"M-AAA protease is a conserved protease that protects the inner mitochondrial membrane from degradation by mitochondria. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of m- AAA protease have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases in humans, hereditary spastic paraplegia and spinocerebellar ataxia. However, the essential functions of the m-Apa protease in neuronal survival remain enigmatic. Here, we show that deletion of a highly expressed subunit of the mitochondrial protein AFG3L2 in mature mouse oligodendrocytes provokes early-mammalian fragmentation and swelling, which is previously shown in neurons, and causes late-onset motor defects and myelin abnormalities. In contrast, total ablation of the protein m-AA protease, deleting the Afg3l2 paralogue of AfG3l1, triggers progressive motor dysfunction and demyelination, owing to rapid neuronal death. Surprisingly, mice with premature hair greying, caused by progressive loss of melanoblasts, share a common developmental origin with Schwann cells targeted in these experiments. Thus, neurons and glial cells are dependant on m-AAA for survival in vivo, and the complete ablation complex is necessary for cell-autonomous thresholds of vulnerability to m-MA protease deficiency.",0.49811267852783203
"Ogataea (Hansenula) polymorpha is a diploid cell species that undergo a reversible change in the structure of their chromosome. This process, mating-type switching, inverts the 19-kb DNA region of the MATa MATα genes and centromeric repression of transcription, depending on orientation of the region. In this study, we investigated the genetic pathway that controls switching in O. polymora. We characterized transcriptomes of the haploid diploids of O.polymorpha using RNAseq in rich nitrogen-deficient media, and found constitutively-specific α-specific genes in MAT genes. We mapped switching defect in sibling species (O. parapolymorpha strain DL-1) and interspecies bulk segregant analysis using frameshift transcription factor EFG1, Candida albicans, which regulates filamentous growth and white- opaque switching. Gene knockout, overexpression, and ChIPseq experiments showed that the transcription factor RME1, which in turn regulates STE12, is necessary for switching mating. Overexpression of EME1 and STE12 was sufficient to induce switching of the nitrogen depletion signal, and homologous recombination of RAD51 and RAD17 were necessary for the switching of mating-types. Our results suggest that the pathway controlling switching in the O. Polymorpha shares components with the regulation of HO in S. cerevisiae, which involve the environmental signal, but shares components of the mating-Type switching in Kluyveromyces lactis, which is also required for white-ink and phenotypic switching in C. albinicans.",0.49811267852783203
"Ovarian epithelial cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer in women and men. The development of ovarian epithelial tumors is poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of an appropriate experimental model for studying the onset and progression of the disease. In this study, we created a mutant mouse model of aberrant estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) signaling in the hypothalamic-pituitary- ovarian axis, which leads to ovarian tumorigenesis. The mice, termed ERαd/d, were conditionally deleted from the anterior pituitary, but remained intact in their hypothalamus and ovary. Loss of negative- feedback regulation of estrogen (E) level in the pituitaries led to increased production of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the ovarian tissue. Hyperstimulation of ovarian cells with LH resulted in elevated steroidogenesis, producing high circulating levels of steroid hormones, including E. In response to elevated levels of E, ERα-dependent gene expression, abnormal cell proliferation, and tumorigenigenesis were observed. Consistent with our findings, treatment with the treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with letrozole, a benzodiazepine inhibitor, markedly reduced circulating E in ovarian tumor volume. Thus, this unique animal model, which serves as a useful tool for exploring the involvement of E-dependent signaling pathways in ovarian epithelia.",0.49811267852783203
"Genome-scale metabolic modeling is a major bottleneck in the establishment of reliable stoichiometric models. Initial reconstructions typically refined comparisons of experimental growth data and gene knockouts in nutrient environments. Existing methods iteratively correct erroneous model prediction time, resulting in accumulating network changes that are globally optimal. We present GlobalFit, a bi-level optimization method that finds a globally optimal network, identifying a minimal set of network changes needed to correctly predict experimentally observed growth and non-growth cases simultaneously. GlobalFit decreases unexplained gene knockout phenotypes by 79% and increasing accuracy by 87.3% (according to current state-of-the-art) and 97.3%. Our application halves the number of unexplained cases in a highly curated E. coli model, increasing accuracy 90.8% and 95.4%.",0.49811267852783203
"The human Y chromosome exhibits surprisingly low levels of genetic diversity. This may be due to neutral processes that are effective in reducing the number of offspring of males and females. Alternatively, selection acting on new mutations, affecting linked neutral sites, may reduce the variability of the Y chromosome. Here, we use genome-wide analyses of X, Y, and autosomal mitochondrial DNA, in combination with extensive population genetic simulations, to show that low observed Y chromosome variability is consistent with a purely neutral model. Instead, models purifying selection and removing deleterious mutations are consistent with observed Y genome variability. We also show that ampliconic regions, which are highly repetitive regions, contribute to the low Y chromosome diversity.",0.49811267852783203
"Plasmodium vivax causes the majority of malaria outside Africa, and is poorly understood at the cellular level, partly due to technical difficulties in maintaining in vitro culture conditions. In the past decades, drug resistant P. vivx parasites have emerged, mainly in Southeast Asia, and molecular markers of resistance have been identified, but so far confirmed experimentally, limits the interpretation of these markers, and the ability to monitor the spread of resistance. In this study, we used a model system to test the role of drug resistance in P. knowlesi. Using episomal expression, we were able to express fourteen of the 14 genes involved in drug resistance, including allelic variants of hypothetical resistance genes. The expression level localisation was assessed, confirming cellular locations conjectured by orthologous species, suggesting locations of previously unlocalised proteins, including the apical location of PVX_101445. Our findings establish P. knowslesi as a suitable model system for P.vivax protein expression. We performed chloroquine and mefloquine drug assays, finding significant differences in drug sensitivity: results of technical issues, indicate that genes are actually involved in resistance, despite positive selection pressure from Southeast Asia.",0.49811267852783203
"In many plant species, conflicts between divergent elements of the immune system, especially nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLR), can lead to hybrid necrosis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we report deleterious allele-specific interactions between NLR and non-NLR gene cluster RESISTANCE PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 7 (RPP7), which confer strain-specific resistance to oomycetes. We also report that the non-NNLR cluster of the POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8)/HOMOLOG RPW8/HR proteins contain a specific N-terminus potential transmembrane domain, followed by a specific coiled-coil (CC) domain similar to those found in pore-forming toxins MLKL and HET-S in mammals and fungi. The C-terminal CC domain is variable in number of 21-14-amino acid repeats, reminiscent of regulatory 21- amino acid repeats in fungal HET and S. The number of repeats in different RPWs8 and HR proteins sequence is dependent on the ability to activate immunity in combination with specific RPP7 partners. A larger number of these repeats could be dangerous depends on the specific RPW/HR autoimmune risk variant.",0.49811267852783203
"Gene transcription is mediated by RNA polymerase II (pol-II). The dynamics of pol-II moving through the transcribed region influence the rate of timing of gene expression. In this work, we present a probabilistic model of transcription dynamics fitted to pol- II occupancy time course data measured by ChIP-Seq. We estimate transcription speed using a Bayesian inference of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The Bayesian approach provides confidence intervals for parameter estimates and allows use of priors to capture domain knowledge, e.g. expected range of transcription speeds, based on previous experiments. Our model describes the movement of the pol-I gene body and identifies the time of induction of transcriptionally engaged genes. By clustering inferred promoter activity time profiles, we are able to determine genes that respond quickly to stimuli in which a group of genes share activity profiles that are co-regulated. We apply our methodology to biological data obtained from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells treated with estradiol (E2). We find that rapidly induced genes are enriched with estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and FOXA1 binding at proximal promoter regions.",0.49811267852783203
"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous B-lymphotropic herpesvirus that is ectopically infects T and NK cells and can cause severe diseases with unknown pathogenesis, including chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV), EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and EBV–HEMHLH. We developed xenograft models of CAEBV EBV and HLH in transplanting patients' PBMC immunodeficient mice with NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rγnull strain. In these models, EBV infected T, NK, and B cells proliferated systemically and reproduced histological characteristics of the diseases. Analysis of TCR repertoire expression revealed identical predominant EBV T-cell clones proliferated in patients corresponding to the mice transplanted from PBMC. Expression of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), LMP2, EBNA2, and engrafted cells was consistent with the latency II program of the EBV gene expression known to be known as CAEBVs. High levels of human cytokines, including IL-8, IFN-γ, and RANTES, were detected in peripheral blood model mice, mirroring the hypercytokinemia characteristic of CAEV and other EBV diseases. Transplantation of individual immunophenotypic subsets of isolated patients from patients with PBMC combinations revealed a critical role for CD4+ T cells in the engraftment of infected T NK cells. In accordance with this finding, in vivo depletion of CD4 + T cells by administration of the OKT4 antibody following transplantation of PBMC resulted in the formation of EBVs-infected T NK and T lymphocytes. These animal models are expected to be useful tools for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of these diseases.",0.49811267852783203
"Rabies is a mosquito-borne disease that is transmitted to humans by the bite of a rabid fox. The disease is transmitted by a single bite of an infected fox, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality. In this study, we used deep sequencing to analyze a densely sampled outbreak of rabies virus in Humboldt County, California. We found that a single amino acid change in the G protein of a haplotype present in a subset of the northern foxes haplotype was associated with increased transmission of the virus in the region. Deep-sequencing data indicated that genetic changes associated with the CST event occurred prior to 2009 and that nonsynonymous mutations were present in consensus sequences of skunk fox rabies samples obtained between 20032010 and 2009. These results suggest that analysis of rare variants in the viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that are potential to be selected for when environment conditions change.",0.49811267852783203
"Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen that causes fatal bacteremia in humans and animals. The bacterium causes a wide range of infections in humans, including pneumonia, pneumonia, and sepsis. The pathogen is able to replicate in host tissues and replicate in the center lesions, which are protected by host immune cells and pseudocapsules. In this study, we identified a coagulase (Coa) and a von Willebrand factor binding protein (vWbp) that are required for the formation of abscesses. Coa and vWbp promote non-proteolytic activation of prothrombin cleavage and fibrinogen, and are inhibited by specific antibody molecules. We show that Coa vWp and specific antibodies confer protection against abscess formation in S. aureuses, and that coa and VWbp may also function as protective antigens against the pathogen.",0.49811267852783203
"Neurons are highly dynamic, with a wide range of functions. However, there are limitations. Recently, extremely efficient population-level methods have been proposed for characterization of population terms in terms of a single variable. Here, we present a method for simulating neural populations based on two dimensional (2D) point spiking neuron models. The method differs from the diffusion approximation, and we reduce the state space to a single dimension (1D). The method is highly modular: variations in deterministic neural dynamics and stochastic process can be investigated independently. Currently, the trend to reduce complex high dimensional neuron models to 2D ones offers a rich dynamical repertoire available in 1D, but limit cycles. We demonstrate that the method is ideally suited to investigate noise systems, replicating the results obtained from diffusion and the generalizing regime of large jumps. We argue that the study of 2D systems subject to noise is important for complementary 1D systems.",0.49811267852783203
"Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease that affects the spine and affects approximately 50% of cases. Despite significant advances in diagnostic imaging techniques and surgical medical treatment for spinal CE, basic understanding of parasite predilection in the spine remains incomplete. To fill this gap, we systematically reviewed published literature for decades to analyze currently existing data on the epidemiological and anatomical aspects of spinal CE.",0.49811267852783203
"Computational neutralization fingerprinting, NFP, is an efficient and accurate method for predicting epitope specificities and polyclonal antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the present-generation NFP algorithms substantially improve the prediction accuracy of individual donors and enable serologic analysis of entire cohorts. Specifically, we developed three algorithms: (a) selection of optimized virus neutralization panels for NFP analysis, (b) estimation of NFP prediction confidence confidence in the serum sample, and (c) identification of sera with potentially novel epitopes specificities. At the individual donor level, the new algorithms were particularly improved in their ability to detect multiple epitopes in the sample, confirmed by computationally simulated polyclon sera samples from HIV-infected donors. Specifically the new algorithm detected multiple specificities twice in the simulated sera, and was able to detect previously confirmed antibody specificities, VRC01-like and PG9-like, in the donor CHAVI 0219. Overall, the analysis of ~150 broadly neutralizing HIV- infected donor samples suggested a potential connection between clade infection types elicited by epitope-specific antibodies.",0.49811267852783203
"The axon guidance receptor is activated by extracellular ligands that regulate growth cone motility and critical for proper wiring established during development. The Roundabout (Robo) guidance receptor mediates repulsion of the ligand Slit in invertebrates and vertebrates. Endocytic trafficking of the Robo receptor is essential for Slit-binding and repulsive signaling output. Dose-dependent genetic interactions in vitro and in vitro Robo activation assays support the role of Clathrin-dependent endocytosis, entry into early late endosomes and positive regulators of Slit and Robo signaling. We identify conserved motifs in Robo cytoplasmic domain that are required for the activation of Robo in vitro; gain function in genetic rescue experiments and provide strong evidence for trafficking events required for Robo repulsive guidance activity in vivo. Our data support a model in which Robo ligand-dependent internalization to the cell surface at the late end of the midline is required for receptor activation and proper repulsive and guidance midline allowing recruitment of downstream effector Son Seven to the spatially constrained endocytic and trafficking compartment.",0.49811267852783203
"Myelin is essential for rapid saltatory conduction produced by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. The cell types transcription factor Sox10 is an essential component of the myelin-specific regulatory network. Here, we identify a Myrf-specific target of Sox10 and map Sox10 as a responsive enhancer of an evolutionarily conserved element of the intron 1 Myrf gene. We show that Myrf cooperates with Sox10 to implement the myelination program, and that the physical interaction between proteins and synergistic activation of myelin is evident. Our analyses indicate that the regulatory network of the Schwann cell is organized similar to the general principles of Schwann's cells, but differentially implemented.",0.49811267852783203
"Humans are able to learn complex behaviors based on a massive stream of sensory information from different modalities. Early animal studies have identified learning mechanisms based on reward punishment. However, the algorithms for reward-based learning are applicable to dimensionality of state-space and sufficiently small structure to be sufficiently simple. In this article, we propose a biologically plausible generic-stage learning system directly applied to raw high-dimensional input streams. The system is composed of a hierarchical slow feature analysis (SFA) network preprocessing and a simple neural network trained based on rewards. We demonstrate that the system is able to perform demanding reinforcement learning tasks in a time comparable to the time needed for explicit and highly informative low-dimensional state-of-space representation given instead of high-dividing visual input. The learning speed of the proposed architecture task is similar to that found in experimental studies in rats. Our study supports the hypothesis that slowness learning is an important unsupervised learning principle utilized to form efficient state representations of behavioral learning.",0.49811267852783203
"Praziquantel (PZQ) is a treatment choice for Opisthorchis viverrini, a major health problem in Southeast Asia. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies investigating the disposition of PZQ enantiomers and their main metabolite, R-trans-4-OH-PUZQ, in diseased patients are lacking. The implementation of dried blood spot (DBS) sampling technique is an important tool to ease the performance of PK studies in remote areas of clinical facilities. The aim of the present study was to validate the use of DBS compared with plasma blood sampling and validate the efficacy of the DBS as a pharmacodynamic (PD) method. DBS was simultaneously collected from patients with 3 oral doses of 25 mg/kg at 4 h intervals. Plasma, blood and DBS were simultaneously collected at selected time points 0 to 24 h post-treatment. The PK parameters were determined by non-compartmental analysis. Drug concentrations in the areas curve (AUC0–24h) were measured using 3 matrices compared to Bland-Altman analysis. Individual drug concentration measurements in patient AUC0-24hs displayed ratios of blood DBS versus plasma of 79–94% and 108–122% of R-S-pZQ and R-Trans-4 -OH, respectively. Pharmacodynamic studies are necessary to correlate PK parameters and efficacy. Dbs appears to be a valid alternative to conventional venous sampling in PZq-treated patients.",0.49811267852783203
"Sex-specific traits, including female-specific ability to bite humans and vector disease, are critical for mosquito reproduction and pathogen transmission. Doublesex (Dsx), a terminal transcription factor of the sex determination pathway, is known to regulate sex-specific gene expression in development of the dengue fever vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. However, the effects of developmental siRNA-mediated dsx silencing on development of adult females have not been assessed in adult females. We found that Dsx-mediated silencing resulted in decreased female wing size, which correlate with body size, typically larger females than larger females. Furthermore, dsX silencing negatively impacted female membrane blood feeding and mating behavior in the laboratory, and decreased fecundity and fertility correlated with decreased ovary length, ovariole length, and ovaryle number. These findings suggest that dsox silencing may be an excellent system to assess developmental genetics and sex-related chemosensation.",0.49811267852783203
"The relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic variation is one of the great outstanding challenges in biology. To meet this challenge, comprehensive genomic variation maps in human model organism populations are required. Here, we present a nucleotide resolution catalog of single-nucleotide, multi- nucleotide, structural variants in 39 Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel inbred lines. Using an integrative, local assembly-based approach to variant discovery, we identify 3.6 million distinct variants, 800,000 unique insertions, deletions (indels), and complex variants (1 6,000 bp). SNP density is higher near variants, and regions with high variant density are particularly mutation-prone. Our data suggest that elevated SNP density and variants are mainly due to population-level processes. Furthermore, we provide insights into regulatory architecture and gene expression variation in adult flies by mapping cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) in 2,000 genes. Indels comprise 10% of cis-eqTLs and have larger effects on SNP density than cis- eQTL. In addition, we identified two-fold gene associations in males compared to females, revealing a partial decoupling of genomic architecture between sexes and the importance of genetic factors mediating sex-biased gene expression.",0.49811267852783203
"The Esperanza Window Trap (EWT) provides alternative human landing collections (HLCs) for the collection of anthropophilic blackflies, known to be effective onchocerciasis vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. EWTs were deployed for 41 days in northern Uganda and south eastern Tanzania, with different Simulium damnosum sibling species responsible for disease transmission. The relative efficacy of EWTs and HLCs compared to the responses of host-seeking blackflies to odour baits, colours, and yeast-produced CO2 was investigated. Blue EWTs baited CO2 worn socks collected 42.3% of the total S. damnosums s.l. catch from northern Uganda. Numbers comparable to collected HLCS (32.1%, 1,817) were higher collected traps baited with CO2 and BG-Lure, a synthetic human attractant. The results of the EWT collections in Uganda and Tanzania were consistent with that of the collection in Tanzania, indicating differences in behaviour in the area.",0.49811267852783203
"The axon, a long thin projection of the neuron, is a key determinant of normal function of the axon. Under normal conditions, the axonal cytoskeletal polymers, microtubules and neurofilaments, align longitudinally to axons interspersed with axonal cross-sections. However, in neurotoxic neurodegenerative disorders, the microtubule-neurofilaments segregate apart, with microtubul membranous organelles clustered centrally in the axons and displaced to the periphery. This striking segregation precedes abnormal excessive neurofilament accumulation in diseases, which in turn leads to focal axonal swellings. Neurofilaments accumulation suggests that the underlying mechanism of segregation is poorly understood. To address this question, we developed a stochastic multiscale model of the cross-sectional distribution of microtubular and neurofilmaments in axons. Our model describes the dynamics of the transport of neurotubules to and from axons over time scales of seconds. The model incorporates longitudinal transport of the neurofilades into the organelle domain allowing stochastically the arrival and departure of cargoes from microtubuli mediated by molecular motors. Simulations of the model demonstrate that in the absence of neurofilmament transport, the mechanism gradually segregates microtubula and neurofilaraments at a time scale of hours, similar to those observed in toxic neuropathies. This model generates experimentally testable prediction of the rate of extent of segregation dependent on the sizes of the moving organelle and density of traffic.",0.49811267852783203
"Cytokinesis terminates mitosis, resulting in separation of sister cells into sister cells. Septins, a conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins, are the absolute requirement for cytokinesis in budding yeast. We show that septin-dependent mammalian cytokineis differs greatly from cell types: genetic loss of a pivotal septin subunit SEPT7 in vivo reveals that septins are indispensable for the cell division of fibroblasts, expendable cells in the hematopoietic system. Septin-independent cells fail to gastrulate, and septin deficient cells exhibit pleiotropic defects in major cytokinetic machinery, including hyperacetylation/stabilization of microtubules and stalled midbody abscission, leading to constitutive multinucleation. We identified the microtubule depolymerizing protein stathmin as a key molecule aiding septin–independent cell division. Stathmin supplementation is sufficient to override septin failure in septin-deficient cells, and we show that knockdown of stathmit makes proliferation of hematoplasts a sensitive septin inhibitor forchlorfenuron.",0.49811267852783203
"The ability of lentiviruses to jump host species is an important determinant of their ability to survive in the host. Identifying and overcoming these differences facilitates the development of animal models of HIV-1, including models based on chimeric SIVs that express HIV-2 envelope (Env) glycoproteins, (SHIVs) and simian-tropic HIV (stHIV) strains. Here, we identify a single amino acid, A281, that affects the ability to use the macaque CD4 receptor. We show that mutations in A281 markedly affect the ability of the Env proteins to use macaques CD4. Importantly, we also show that A281 does not markedly affect its Env neutralization properties. These findings facilitate the design of new animal models and expedite development of clinically relevant reagents for testing and testing interventions against HIV.",0.49811267852783203
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is chronically infecting the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, cystic fibrosis (CF), and bronchiectasis. Cif (PA2934), a bacterial toxin secreted from outer membrane vesicles (OMV) of P. aerugino, reduces CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in human airway epithelial cells, a key driving force for mucociliary clearance. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which Cif inhibits CFTR and chloride secretion. We found that Cif redirected endocytosed CFTR recycling from endosomes to lysosomes by stabilizing the inhibitory effect of G3BP1 deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and increasing the degradation of CFTR lysoomes. We also found that the bacterial toxin regulates the activity of the host DUB. These data suggest that the ability to infect patients with COPD, pneumonia, and CF, and that the secretion of OMV containing Cif, reduces the clearance of pathogens.",0.49811267852783203
"Gram-negative bacteria secrete virulence factors that assemble fibre structures on the cell surface and specialized secretion systems. In this study, we describe the crystal structure of the pilotins of T2SS, T3SS and T4PS, which are characterized by large outer membrane channels formed by proteins called secretins. Usually, the cognate lipoprotein pilot is essential for the assembly of secretin in the outer membrane. However, the molecular mechanism of the process is poorly understood. Here, we report a crystal structure that is profoundly different from previously solved pilotins. The architecture is described by insertion of the α-helical hairpin into the second open α- helical hairpins and bent the final helix. We show that pilotin binds tightly to 18 residues close to the C-terminus of the secretin, and that the residues, unstructured binding to pilotin, are helical binding. Our data collected from the complex suggests that secretin peptide binds pilotin in experiments and confirm the importance of C- terminal residues in vivo.",0.49811267852783203
"Vaccinia virus, the camelpox virus, infects eukaryotic cells and causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. Vaccinia virus is the causative agent of this disease. The virus has been shown to be able to induce apoptosis induced by intrinsic extrinsic stimuli. In this study, we show that a new apoptosis inhibitor, Golgi, is able to inhibit the expression of the viral GAAP (v-GAAP) and human GAAP, in human tissues. We also show that deletion of the Golgi gene in vaccinia virus can affect virus replication in cell culture, and that the virus virulence in murine infection model. Our study identifies a new regulator of cell death in highly conserved evolution in plants, amphibians, mammals, and poxviruses.",0.49811267852783203
"The Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans, is widespread in Arequipa, Perú, Peru. Despite a decades-long campaign to treat 70,000 houses treated with insecticides, infestation prevalence has greatly reduced. To monitor T. infestan resurgence, the city is currently conducting a surveillance phase to sample houses selected for inspection during the inspection year. Despite extensive data control campaign to inform surveillance, selection of houses to inspect is carried out haphazardly and at the convenience of the city. Therefore, we asked, what can be done to enhance efforts to prevent T.infestans resurgence by creating an opportunity for vector surveillance informed by data?To this end, we developed a mobile app that provides vector infestation risk maps generated by the data-control campaign and run a predictive model. The app is intended to enhance vector surveillance activities by giving inspectors an opportunity to incorporate infestation and risk information into surveillance activities, and dictate houses to surveil.",0.49811267852783203
"Mammalian genomes comprise active fossilized retroelements. This obligate requirement for retroelement integration affords host genomes the opportunity to ‘domesticate’ retroelement genes for their purpose, leading to important innovations in genome defense during placentation. In mammals, exaptations involve retroviruses, L1TD1 is a gene known as a domesticated gene protein-coding sequence entirely derived from LINE-1 (L1) retroelement. We show that the L1TL1 gene has been shown to play an important role in pluripotency maintenance during mammalian evolution. We hypothesize that L1TB1 originally evolved as a common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost pseudogenized multiple times in mammalian evolution, including during primate and mouse evolution. Our study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology, and suggests that domesticated genes adopt different functions in different lineages.",0.49811267852783203
"DNA ligase IV (Dnl4) is a specialized ligase for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Dnl4 has been implicated in many human diseases, but its role in DSB repair has been mainly examined in gene deletions. In this study, we show that dnl4 catalytic point mutants generated severely defective auto-adenylation and in vitro NHEJ activity in vivo, despite hyper- recruited DSBs supporting wild-type levels of Lif1 interaction with the assembly of Ku- and Lif1-containing complexes. Interestingly, the residual levels were especially imprecise in the mutant mutants, suggesting a role for DSB-bound Dl4 in the supporting mode of NHEJA catalyzed by a different ligase. Similarly, generation of repair joints from a distinct single-DSB assay showed that a mutation conferred significantly different imprecised joining profile than the one observed in mutant mutants. These findings suggest that Dnl 4 may promote mutagenic end joining independently of its catalytic activity, a likely mechanism involves Cdc9.",0.5139490962028503
"DNA double strand break repair (BER) is an important step in DNA repair. BER is the first step in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In this study, we present evidence that FACT is directly involved in Base Excision Repair and elucidate the chromatin remodeling mechanisms of FACT during BER. We found that oxidative stress induces FACT to release transcription related protein complexes that are associated with repair proteins of chromatin and remodelers of the SWI/SNF family. Interestingly, FACT facilitates the removal of uracil-DNA glycosylase from the nucleosomal DNA thanks to the enhancement of remodeling activity of RSC. Altogether, our data suggest that the FACT acts in concert with RSC to facilitate the excision of DNA lesions at the initial step of BER and that this is a novel property for FACT.",0.5139490962028503
"Metazoan genomes encode hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). These proteins regulate post-transcriptional gene expression and play critical roles in numerous cellular processes including mRNA splicing, export, and stability of translation. Despite their ubiquity and importance, binding preferences of RBPs are not well characterized. In vitro and in vivo studies, affinity selection-based approaches have successfully identified RNA sequence associated with specific RBPs; however, it is difficult to infer RBP sequence structural preferences using specifically designed motif finding methods. In this study, we introduce a new motif-finding method, RNAcontext, designed to elucidate RBP-specific sequence structural and structural preferences with greater accuracy than existing approaches. We evaluated RNAcontext recently published in vitro and vivo RNA affinity selected data and demonstrate that RNAcontext identifies known binding preferences for control proteins including HuR, PTB, Vts1p, and predicts new RNA structure preferences for SF2/ASF, RBM4, FUSIP1, and SLM2. Our predicted binding preferences are consistent with recently reported in vivo binding sites. RNAcontext is an accurate and efficient motif finding method that is ideally suited for large-scale RNA- binding affinity datasets to determine relative binding preferences to RBPs across a wide range of RNA sequences structures.",0.5139490962028503
"The human papillomavirus genome undergoes three distinct stages of replication: establishment, maintenance and amplification. The HPV16 E6 protein is required for the maintenance of the HPV16 DNA genome in the extrachromosomal, nuclear plasmid of the natural host cell, the human keratinocyte. Based on mutational analyses, we found that inactivation of p53 E6, necessarily E6-mediated degradation by p53, did not correlate with the ability of E6 to support maintenance of HPV16. Inactivation of the dominant negative p53 rescued the ability to replicate HPV16 and E6STOP E6SAT mutant genomes and replicate their extrachromeosomal genomes, but not to the degree observed with HPV16 or E6 in the wild-type (WT) genome. We conclude that inactivating p53 is necessary for maintaining HPV16, 18 and 31 genomes in the context of persistent infections.",0.5139490962028503
"Sensory processing is associated with gamma frequency oscillations (30–80 Hz) in sensory cortices. However, it is unclear whether gamma oscillations are directly involved in the representation of time-changing stimuli, including stimuli on a time scale with a longer gamma cycle. We address this issue by using a dynamical model of spiking neurons to study the response to asymmetric sawtooth input with a current range of shape parameters. The parameters describe fast input current rises and falls over time. We find that oscillations in the gamma range are sufficient to generate oscillations of period-to-stimulus duration. We also find that excitatory cells fire a single spike of a stimulus, depending on the tuning properties of the temporal structure of the specific input; identity of the stimulus coded by the list of excitator cells in the fire cycle makes a robust uniform warping time scale.",0.5139490962028503
"Genetic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events by serving as null models of genome scans and selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants in populations. We numerically compute the expected spectrum of diffusion in a composite likelihood scheme, where linkage neutral loci alters the variance and the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties and the significance values of hypothesis tests. Our method incorporate selection into single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles in populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, admixture, and admixture. We estimate the divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95% confidence interval: 40–270 kya) and the divergence of European and East Asian (CHB) populations at 23 kya. Our analysis yields evidence of subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with previously estimated distribution of selective effects of newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency of nonsynonymous variants in continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).",0.5139490962028503
"Trypanosomatid-borne diseases are caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, we describe the purification of crovirin, a cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) from the venom of the infective trypanosomes Leishmania cruzi and trypomastigotes. Crude venom extract is loaded with reverse phase analytical (C8) column and loaded with high performance liquid chromatographer. The linear gradient of water/acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was measured. The peak containing an isolated protein (confirmed by SDS- PAGE mass spectrometry) was collected and the protein content measured. Crovirin is sensitive to the intracellular amastigote, L. amazonensis promastigot, and amatigotes in the procyclic bloodstream of trypomsomatids. The toxicity was tested in LLC-MK2 cells, peritoneal macrophages and isolated from the murine extensor digitorum longus muscle. The purified single protein of Cvv venom was corresponding to CRISP 24,893.64 Da, henceforth referred to as crovirins. Human infective and intracellae are sensitive to crovin, with low IC50 LD50 values (1.10–2.38 µg/ml) and a considerably higher concentration (20 µg / ml) than croviran required to elicit limited toxicity in mammalian cells. This study suggests that the members of the family of potential drugs could lead to the development of novel agents against tryposomatin-borne neglected diseases.",0.5139490962028503
"Schistosoma mansoni is a major cause of tropical infectious disease, schistosomiasis. Recently, we discovered a group of trypsin-like serine proteases with domain organization unique to flatworm parasites containing thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR-1). These proteases are recognized as antigens of host infection and may prove useful for anthelminthic vaccines. However, their molecular characteristics are not well-studied. Here, we characterize the structural and proteolytic attributes of serine protein 2 (SmSP2) of Schistosomes mansoni, a major species responsible for tropical infectious diseases, and the major virulence factor of this parasite. SmSP2 comprises three domains: histidine stretch, TSR-2 and serine-like protease domain. The cleavage specificity and specificity of recombinant SmSPs were determined by positional scanning and multiplex combinatorial libraries. The determinants of specificity were identified in 3D homology models, demonstrating the trypsins-like endopeptidase mode of action. We also show that SmSP 2 is secreted, functions as a host-parasite interface and contributes to the survival of the parasite by manipulating the host vasodilatation and fibrinolysis. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which the parasite is able to manipulate the host's immune system.",0.5139490962028503
"The Caenorhabditis elegans Wnt signalling pathway has a wide range of functions in animals, including induction of cell fates and tumours, guidance of cell movements and gastrulation, and induction of cells polarity. However, how Wnt induces polar changes in cellular morphology and remodelling of the cytoskeleton is not well understood. Here, we show that the CED-10/R/12 branch of the Wnt pathway is activated by the MOM-5/Fz receptor, GSK-3 kinase, APC/APC/ APR-1, and activates the Frizzled receptor in C. elegans. Our epistatic analyses suggest that partially redundant signalling pathways defined earlier in engulfment act as a single pathway in early embryos.",0.5139490962028503
"Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus plays a critical role in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. It remains unknown, however, how new neurons are functionally integrated into spatial circuits and how they contribute to hippocampus-mediated forms of learning and memory. To investigate these issues, we used a mouse model of the differentiation of adult-generated neurons. In contrast to previous studies, we predicted that the number of newly generated neurons would be affected by a strategy that selectively changes the timing of differentiation. New, adult-derived neurons were significantly reduced in dendritic arborization and spine density. Functionally, genetic manipulation specifically affected different hippocamp-dependent learning memory tasks, including contextual fear conditioning, and selectively reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Morphological functional analyses of hippocampal neurons at different stages of differentiation, following transgene activation and defined time-windows, revealed that new, adult–generated neurons were 3–4 weeks of age required to acquire new spatial information and use previously consolidated memories. These results suggest that correct unwinding of key memory functions, such as the ability of the adult-genesis to link subsequent events to memory circuits, is critically dependent on the correct timing of initial stages of neuron maturation and the connection between existing circuits.",0.5139490962028503
"The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus that is responsible for the development of multiple cancer types. In this study, we show that RTA, a master regulator of lytic replication, interacts with STAT6 to promote lysine 48 (K48) and K63-linked ubiquitylation and STAT6 degradation in proteasome and lysosome systems. We show that degradation of STAT6 dramatically associated with increased ubiquitylated form of the tripartite motif family like 2 (TRIML2, tumor suppressor) and prolonged cell survival and virion production, which is commonly observed during lytic activation of Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus. Our results suggest that degradation by STAT6 is an important lytic activator of KSHV, an attractive therapeutic target.",0.5139490962028503
"Severe fever thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is caused by the tick-borne phlebovirus family Bunyaviridae. Studies have found that humans, domestic wildlife and animals are infected with SFTSV. However, the viral ecology, circulation, and transmission remain largely unknown. In this study, we collected 9,984 ticks from vegetation and small wild mammals in an endemic area of Jiangsu, China, and detected SFTSVs-RNA in real-time RT-PCR questing and feeding of Haemaphysalis longicornis and H. flava. Viral RNA was identified as larvae of H. longicornsis prior to blood meal, and confirmed previously in nature. In addition, SFTSN-RNA antibodies were detected in wild mammals including Erinaceus europaeus and Sorex araneus. We also observed that the live and live strains of SFTSSV were isolated from Erinacesus europanis and captured during tick-feeding season. These findings provide novel insights into the ecology, reservoir hosts, transmission, and nature of the virus and may help develop new measures preventing rapid spread regionally and globally.",0.5139490962028503
"HIV-1 infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa represent 10% of the world population and 2/3 of the HIV-1/AIDS cases. However, the disproportionate prevalence of helminthic parasite infections in the region has not been prospectively tested in a relevant in vivo model. We measured the pre-existing infection of rhesus monkeys with a parasitic worm, Schistosoma mansoni, and challenged intrarectally decreasing doses of the R5-tropic clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C). Systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys but the viral doses remained sub-infected in normal hosts. In fact, 50% of animal infectious (AID50) was 17-fold lower than parasitized animals compared to controls (P<0.001). Coinfected animals had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads than controls, and increased viral replication of CD4+ central memory cells (P = 0.03). Our data provide direct evidence that acute schistosomiasis significantly increases the risk of de novo AIDS virus acquisition, and the magnitude of this effect suggests that control of parasitic worm infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV.",0.5139490962028503
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common, heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, and repetitive restricted patterns of behavior. Neuroligin3 (NLGN3), a cell adhesion molecule in the neuronal synapse, is the most common risk gene for ASD, and additional variants of NLGN3 and NLGN4 have been found in ASD patients. However, synaptopathies are not known to cause neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. In humans, NLGNs consist of family members, and neuroligin1 is a major component of forming a complex of excitatory and glutamatergic synapses. In ASD patients, the significance of the NLGN1 gene in the etiology and etiology of ASD is unknown. Here, we systematically examine the missense variants in NLGN-1 detected in ASD and P89L mice, and we show that these mutations are associated with changes in cellular localization, protein degradation, and impairment in spine formation. Furthermore, we generated knock-out mice from P89 and heterozygote mice that display abnormal social behavior, a core feature of ASD. These results, for the first time, implicate rare variants of the gene that are functionally significant for NLGN synaptic pathway and the importance of its etiology in neuropsychiatrics disorders.",0.5139490962028503
"Tissue morphogenesis relies on proper differentiation of morphogenetic domains, adopting specific cell behaviours. However, how signalling pathways interact to determine coordinate domains remains poorly understood. Dorsal closure (DC) in the Drosophila embryo represents a powerful model to study epithelial cell sheet sealing. In this process, JNK (JUN N-terminal Kinase) signalling controls leading edge (LE) differentiation, generating local forces of cell shape changes essential for DC. In addition to JNK, a number of signalling pathways converges and interacts ( anterior/posterior-AP- determination; segmentation genes, Wnt/Wingless; TGFβ/Decapentaplegic). To better characterize the properties of the LE morphogenetics domain, we sought new JNK target genes in a genomic approach: 25 identified 8 specifically expressed in LE, similarly to those that were previously identified in decapentapelegic and puckered. Quantitative in situ gene profiling of a new set of LE genes reveals a complex patterning of LE AP axis, involving a two-way interplay between the JNK pathway, segmentation and HOX genes. Patterning LE discrete domains appears essential for coordination of tissue sealing dynamics.",0.5139490962028503
"Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Schistosoma mansoni. It is caused by an enzyme called cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is involved in the regulation of cellular functions. In this study, we have characterized the role of PKA in schistosome biology and characterized genes encoding the schistoome PKAs. We provide biochemical evidence that the PKA signaling pathway is required for parasite viability and viability in vitro and provide a description of the gene encodes a catalytic subunit of S. mansoni, named SmPKA-C. Finally, we demonstrate that RNA interference, which is detected biochemically by inhibition of SmPK-C expression, results in parasite death. These data suggest that SmPk-C is a critically important gene product and represent an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of schistomiasis.",0.5139490962028503
"The small GTPase Rac is an important regulator of cell polarization, cytoskeletal reorganization, motility, and motility in mammalian cells. In recent microfluidic experiments, HeLa cells were endowed with appropriate constructs and subjected to gradients of small molecule rapamycin leading to the synthetic membrane recruitment of Rac activator and direct graded activation of membrane-associated Rac. Rac activation was triggered by independent upstream signaling mechanisms responsible for transducing activating gradient signals. The response of cells to stimulation depended on exceeding the threshold of activated Rac. We develop a minimal reaction-diffusion model of the GTPases network and the interaction between Rac and phosphoinositide crosstalk consistent with experimental observations of polarization in cells. Our modeling suggests that mutual inhibition of Rac activation is likely to be the mode for cell polarization and that positive feedback from Rac activation may stabilize unstable polarization. We use a new analytical tool, Local Perturbation Analysis, to approximate partial differential equations of ordinary differential equations and local global variables. Our method helps to analyze parameter space and behaviour of proposed models. Our experiments suggest that spatially uniform stimulation serves to sensitize cell to applied gradients.",0.5139490962028503
"The visual system consists of a ventral stream, specialized for object recognition, and a dorsal visual stream, crucial for spatial vision and actions. However, little is known about the interactions between these two flow streams. In this study, we investigated the interactions of the network processing-dimensional (3D) object information, comprising the dorsal and ventral streams, with the dorsal stream. Reversible inactivation of macaque caudal intraparietal area (CIP) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reduced fMRI activations in the posterior parietal cortex and dorsal stream, surprisingly, in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC) and the ventral visual stream. We found that CIP inactivation caused a perceptual deficit in the depth-of-the-field categorization task. Our results provide causal evidence for the flow of visual 3D information between the dorsal, ventral and visual streams, and identify CIP as a key area of depth-structural processing.",0.5139490962028503
"ComK transcriptionally controls competence uptake by transforming DNA into DNA in Bacillus subtilis. In a clonal population randomly selected for competence, ComK activates the promoter, and cells exceeding the threshold of ComK trigger a positive feedback loop, transitioning into a competence state. The transition rate increases as the maximum approach to the stationary phase decreases, but cells remaining remain. The average basal rate of comK transcription increases transiently, defining a window of opportunity for transitions accounting for heterogeneity in the competent populations. The concentration response regulator Spo0A∼P increases the entry into stationary phase, which induces comK promoter activity and represses direct binding. The activation of the antagonizing repressor, Rok, amplifies the inherent increase in the basal level of the ComK promoter, which takes place at the approach to stationary phase. This is a general feature of core promoters, serving as a couple of the probability of competence transitions and the growth rate. Competence transitions are regulated by a set of temporally controlled complex mechanisms that govern the formation of the spindle and the fate-determining noise of competence intrinsic to the comK promoters. The overall mechanism is stochastically simulated and has been shown to be plausible. However, the deterministic mechanism modulates the inherently stochastic process.",0.5139490962028503
"Primate lentiviruses encode “ accessory proteins” including Vif, Vpu, Nef, and Vpr/Vpx. Vif and Vpu counteract antiviral effects of cellular restrictions in the early late steps of the viral replication cycle. Here, we present evidence that Vpx and HIV-2/SIVSM promote virus infection by antagonizing antiviral restriction in macrophages. Vpx is essential for virus infection, whereas HIV-1 and SIVSM are dispensable for viral infection. We generated heterokaryons that supported infection with wild-type SIV and Vpx-deleted SIV. The restriction of Vpx was potently antagonized by infection with macrophage infected with infected SIV, but the expression of the Vpx ubiquitylated ubiquitylation proteasome was regulated by Vpx. Our results indicate that the ability of the virus to counteract the restriction of HIV/1 or SIV infection is dependent on the HIV-3 Vpx interacting protein, damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), and DDB1 partially substituted for Vpx fused with Vpr. These results suggest that the virus can harbor a potent antiviral effect in primate and lentivirus strains.",0.5139490962028503
"Bacteria have diverse mechanisms of competition, including biosynthesis of extracellular enzymes and antibiotic metabolites, changes in community physiology, biofilm formation and motility. Considered collectively, networks of competitive functions in an organism determine success or failure of competition. In this study, we studied the competitive interaction between two soil bacteria: Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces sp. Mg1 (S.Mg1). We found that when S.mg1 is cultured at the agar surface, colonies of B. subtilises suffer cellular lysis and progressive degradation caused by S. MG1 cultured at a distance. We also found that the lytic degradative activity (LDA) of linearmycins, produced in the absence of LDA, is sufficient to cause lysis in B.tilis. We identified a missense mutation in yfiJK, which encodes a previously uncharacterized-component signaling system. We confirmed that the gain-of-function alleles of yfJK and yfiLMN are necessary for LDA resistance. Downstream yfiLN genes encode an ATP-binding cassette transporter, which is necessary for lysis. These developmental phenotypes suggest that these competitive functions are distinct, but regulated by a single-component system. Our findings suggest that a subpopulation of bacteria in the soil can activate an array of defensive responses to counter lytic stress imposed by competition. Coordinated regulation of development of antibiotic resistance is a streamlined mechanism to promote competitive fitness in bacteria.",0.5139490962028503
"The Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is one of the most common herpesviruses in the world. During its life cycle, KSHV is able to switch from productive infection to productive infection. However, it is not clear how this switch occurs. We have recently identified a Pim family kinase, Pim-3, as a novel cellular regulator of viral reactivation. We demonstrate that the expression of this Pim kinase is induced by the physiological chemical reactivation of naturally infected cells. Furthermore, we show that the Pim protein is required for the reactivation and phosphorylating of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) serine residues 205 and 206. These data suggest that Pim proteins are novel cellular regulators of the gammaherpesvirus life cycle and may be novel targets for therapeutic intervention.",0.5139490962028503
"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Schistosoma japonicum. The disease is transmitted by the larvae of the parasite, which are transmitted by infected hosts. In Asia and Africa, the identification of different geographical strains of the disease by microsatellites can pave the way for better understanding the transmission and epidemiology of the parasitic disease. In the Philippines, the present study aims to apply microsatellite markers to analyzing populations of S. japonica in different endemic areas of the Philippines. The results of the study show that the genetic diversity of parasite populations in the endemic areas can be determined by genetic surveillance. The degree of genetic diversity observed in the parasite population in endemic areas varies. Geographical separation is considered as one of the factors accounting for the observed difference in parasite genotypes in the present population. Clustering analysis showed particular spatial structuring and structuring in parasite populations between different endemic and endemic areas. Based on the results of this study, it is reasonable to conclude that genetic diversity is a possible criterion to assess the infection status in highly endemic areas, and indirectly reflects the success of the control program in schistosomeiasis-endemic areas.",0.5139490962028503
"Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, a major public health problem in Latin America. Efforts to generate new therapies have been hampered by limitations in understanding parasite biology and disease pathogenesis. Studies have compromised the complexity of the disease, the long-term nature of infection, and the fact parasites are barely detectable at the chronic stage. In addition, functional dissection of T. cruzi biology is restricted by the limited flexibility of genetic manipulation technology applicable to the parasite. Here, we describe technical innovations, which allow the role of parasite disease progression and disease progression better assessed. First, we generated a reporter strain that expresses a fusion protein comprising red- shifted luciferase and green fluorescent protein domains. This allows the kinetics of infection followed by a single animal, and specific foci of infection are pinpointed in excised tissues. Fluorescence allows us to visualise individual parasites in tissue sections and to study host-parasite interactions at the cellular level. This strategy is routinely able to find individual parasites chronically infected in murine tissues at the time of infection. The second advance is the incorporation of a streamlined CRISPR/Cas9 functionality into the reporter strain to facilitate genome editing. The system allows rapid generation of null mutants of fluorescently tagged parasites and their background in vivo phenotype can be rapidly assessed. These techniques have been described in multiple applications, including studying aspects of parasite biology, pathogenesis and parasite interactions.",0.5139490962028503
"Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease, possesses extensive genetic diversity. This has led to the development of a plethora of molecular typing methods for the identification of known major genetic lineages and fine scale characterization of different multilocus genotypes of major lineages. However, the current gold standard for T. cruzi typing, which relies on large sample sizes, is currently not available. In this work, we present an optimized Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme, based on combined analysis of recently proposed MLST approaches. The MLST scheme consisted of thirteen concatenated gene fragments applied to a panel of T.cruzi reference strains encompassing known genetic linesages. Concatenation of 13 fragments allowed assignment of strains predicted for Discrete Typing Units (DTUs), near-clades, with the exception of a strain outlier of TcV, which had an apparent loss of heterozygosity in the fragment. Monophyly DTUs, robust bootstrap support, restored the fragment, and the fragment was subsequently excluded from analysis. The optimal combination consisted of 7 loci that discriminated from the reference strains panel, majority of which supported robust bootstra values. Additionally, reduced panel 4 gene fragments displayed high bootstrap values and DTU assignment discriminated from 21 of 25 genotypes. Our results suggest that a seven- fragment MLST system is the gold standard of all types of gene typing, particularly single locus approaches and systematic PCR assays based on amplicon size.",0.5139490962028503
"The plant hormone auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. Recent progress in Arabidopsis has provided a scheme for auxin receptors, TIR1/AFBs, to target transcriptional co-repressors, AUX/IAAs, and degradation, allowing ARFs to regulate the transcription of auxin responsive genes. However, the mechanism of the auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation is not considered to have evolved in the time plants adapted to the land. Here, we show that the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, which belongs to the earliest diverging lineage of land plants, belongs to a conserved lineage of plant hormone receptors. We show that MpIAA and ARFs have different transcriptional activities, corresponding to the phylogenetic classifications of these two lineages. Our study provides evidence that pleiotropic auxin responses are achieved by a minimal set of auxins signaling factors, suggesting that auxin signaling factors may be a key invention to establish body plans for land plants.",0.5139490962028503
"Epilepsy is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people in the world. It is caused by a variety of brain disorders, including idiopathic and generalized epilepsies. In this study, we describe the development of a framework for the analysis of functional networks inferred from resting state EEG recordings from 35 adults and 40 healthy adult controls. We find that the critical strength of coupling required to synchronize the global network significantly decreased epilepsy in the epilepsy cohort. This study demonstrates the ability of a computer model based analysis of routine clinical EEG recordings to identify individuals with epilepsy and to identify the left frontal regions as potential driver of seizure activity networks.",0.5139490962028503
"Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most important arboviruses and is transmitted by the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. However, the exact mechanism of viral inhibition is not fully understood. In this study, we explored the possible involvement of the pelo protein, which is involved in protein translation, and Wolbachia-mediated antiviral response in mosquito-DENV interaction. We found that the Pelo protein upregulated DENV replication silencing leads to reduced DENV virion production, suggesting that the presence of Wolbachiae, specifically in female mosquitoes, may contribute to the reduction of DENV virus replication. In addition, the microRNA aae-miR-2940-5p, abundance highly enriched in Wolbachias-infected mosquitoes, mediate the regulation of pelo. Our data reveals the identification of a pelo host factor as positively involved in DENV infection, and that the suppression of the presence and the absence of Wolbiont contribute to virus blocking exhibited by endosymbiont.",0.5139490962028503
"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for the production of beer, bread, wine, and other food products. It was domesticated from wild populations associated with trees. The origins of these domesticated populations are not clear; human-associated migration and admixture of wild populations had a strong impact on S. cerevisia population structure. We examined the population genetic history of beer strains found in ale strains and lager strains derived from admixture populations with closely related European grape wine strains and Asian rice wine strains. Similar to lager baking strains, ale strains are polyploid, providing a passive means of remaining isolated from populations providing a living relic of ancestral hybridization. We also found that ale strains contain novel alleles derived from extinct and uncharacterized populations. We conclude that modern beer strains are product of historical melting pot fermentation technology.",0.5139490962028503
"Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Due to the growth of international travel and immigration, NTDs are diagnosed in countries in the western world, with a specific focus on the literature on imported NTD’s. In this study, a cohort of immigrants and travelers from Spain was analyzed. The main NTD was diagnosed in immigrants: schistosomiasis (n  =  240, 9.1%) acquired mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, Chagas disease (n  =  95, 3.6%) from immigrants from South America, ascariasis (n� =   86, 3,3.3%) found mainly from immigrants in sub-Saharan Africa. The most frequent NTD were diagnosed by immigrants from Latin America, and by VFR travelers from sub -Saharan Africa. In addition, the most frequent infections were found among immigrants from Africa. These findings highlight the possibility of non-vectorial transmission outside endemic areas and the impact of eradication programmes in endemic countries on non-tropical western countries.",0.5139490962028503
"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce HIV levels in plasma to undetectable levels, but little is known about the effects of ART outside of the peripheral blood and persistent virus production in tissue reservoirs. Understanding the dynamics of ART-induced reductions in viral RNA (vRNA) levels in the body is important for development strategies to eradicate infectious HIV patients. In this study, we characterized the impact of targeted cytotoxic therapy on HIV RNA levels in multiple organs of bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) and humanized mice. We found that the drug penetration activity was sufficient to reduce, eliminate, and eliminate, HIV production in BLT mice undergoing ART. We also found that, compared to ART, the agent profoundly depleted productively infected cells systemically and systemically. These results offer proof-of-concept for targeted chemotoxic therapies as effective components of HIV eradication strategies.",0.5139490962028503
"Antibiotic-resistant infections kill approximately 23,000 people each year in the United States, despite widespread use of small-molecule antimicrobial combination therapy. Antibiotic combinations typically have an additive effect: the efficacy of a combination matches the sum of the efficacies of the antibiotic. Small molecules act synergistically with the antibiotic to produce greater additive efficacy. However, synergistic combinations are rare and historically difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic pairs has limited the scale of potential combinations: a modest collection of 1,000 small molecules involves 1 million pairwise combinations. Here, we describe a high-throughthroughput method to identify synergistic small molecules, the overlap2 method (O2 M). O2 M extracts patterns of chemical-genetic datasets, and creates a collection of mutants grown in the presence of hundreds of different small molecules. The identification of mutants that can be treated with known synergistic molecules allows us to pinpoint additional molecule combinations that can bypass drug resistance.",0.5139490962028503
"Morphogenetic transitions are prevalent in the fungal kingdom. The leading human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, has the capacity to transition yeast filaments into key virulence factors. In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, filamentation enables nutrient acquisition and nutrient acquisition. In this study, we identified the Mfg1 regulator of morphogenesis, which acts as a complex with Flo8 and Mss11 to mediate transcriptional responses crucial for filamentation. However, the mechanisms that regulate morphogenesis remained elusive. Here, we explored the consequences of perturbation of Mfg2, Flo8, and MSS11 in C. albica morphogenesis and identified functional divergence between the complex members. We observed that in C., albican Mfg3 and Flo8 are dispensable in filamentation, while overexpression of FLO8 caused constitutive filamentation in the absence of Mg1. Harnessing transcriptional profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis, identified divergence of transcriptional targets between Flo8 Mfg4 and MFS11 during morphogenesis. Our work highlights the rewiring of key morphogenetic regulators during the evolutionary time aneuploidy is an adaptive mechanism driving fungal morphogenesis in the model organism.",0.5088204145431519
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) primarily resides in the lung and can persist in extrapulmonary sites. Macrophages are considered the prime cellular habitat of Mtb. In this study, we demonstrate that Mtb resides inside adipose tissue and expresses stress-related genes. We show that perigonadal fat from Mtb-infected mice is disseminated during infection and transferred to uninfected animals. Adipose tissue harbors leukocytes in addition to adipocytes and cell types observed during Mtb infection. Mice infected with the aerosol showed infiltration of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1 (Arg1)-negative F4/80+ cells, despite recruitment of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Gene expression analysis of adipose tissues from aerosol Mtb infected mice provided evidence of upregulated expression of genes associated with T cells and NK cells 28 days post-infection. Strikingly, IFN-γ-producing NK cells were identified in perigonadonadal fat, specifically in CD8-CD44-CD69++CD8+CD44 and CD103+ subpopulations. Our results suggest that the ability of the Mtb to persist in the fat tissue is a potential niche for Mtb in which NK cells are attracted to the tissue.",0.5088204145431519
"The emergence of cheater strategies can destabilize populations by engaging in social cooperative behaviors, demonstrating the potential for bi-directional coupling between population density and evolution of a cooperative trait. Despite the potential importance of eco-evolutionary feedback loops in social species, their experimentally and experimentally ecological implications are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a strong feedback loop in population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics of a social microbial gene, SUC2, in laboratory yeast populations. We directly visualize the eco- evolutionary trajectories of hundreds of populations over 50–100 generations, allowing us to characterize phase space describing the interplay between evolution and ecology in a system. Small populations collapse despite continual evolution and increased cooperative allele frequencies; large populations are in a stable state of coexistence between cooperator and cheater. The presence of cheaters significantly affects equilibrium population density, reducing the resilience of the population to adapt to a rapidly deteriorating environment. Our results demonstrate the potential ecological importance of coupling evolutionary dynamics and population dynamics in cooperatively growing organisms, particularly microbes.",0.5088204145431519
"Host defense against the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) requires innate adaptive immunity. In this study, we directly imaged immune cell dynamics and Lm foci established in dendritic cells in subcapsular red pulp (scDC) using intravital microscopy. Blood borne Lm was rapidly associated with scDC and swarmed non-motile scDC forming foci with blood flow excluded. The depletion of scDC foci resulted in a 10-fold reduction in viable Lm, and a 30–1000 fold increase in viable lm and enhanced blood flow. Effector CD8+ T cells at sites of infection displayed a two-tiered reduction in motility and antigen independent antigen dependent components, including stable interactions with infected and non-infected scDC. These findings suggest that scDC may contribute to control of Lm prior to development of T cell immunity.",0.5088203549385071
"Epigenetic variation in humans is characterized by high inter-individual epigenetic variation, termed Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs). VMRs occur preferentially in enhancers of 3’ UTRs and are highly correlated with variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks of low and high heritability. In this study, we identified a network of 95 co-regulated genes that enriched genes for roles in transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways of functional relevance in tissue. We found that fibroblasts and neurons networks were enriched for genes that play roles in T-cell activation; and neurons network was enriched for the expression of HOX gene clusters. We experimentally demonstrated that VMR networks were responsive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels at loci changing in coordinated fashion in a coordinated fashion to trans dependent cellular growth. Intriguingly, environmentally-responsive VMCs showed strong enrichment at imprinted loci (p<10−80), suggesting particularly sensitive environmental conditions. Our study provides a detailed map of common epigenetic variations in the human genome, showing that genetic environmental causes underlie variation.",0.5088204145431519
"Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial cell-to-cell communication process that relies on the production, release, and response of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. QS controls the virulence and biofilm formation of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aerugina possesses two canonical LuxI/R-type QS systems, LasI and RhlI. The two systems are able to detect the 3OC12-homoserine lactone and C4- homoserine-lactone, respectively. In this study, we show that the ΔrhlR mutant displays radically different biofilm phenotypes in animals than the ΔrlI mutant. We propose that the alternative ligand RhlR responds to alternative ligands, in addition to the canonical C4 and homoserines, and promotes the transcriptional program of genes encoding virulence factors.",0.5088204145431519
"Influenza is transmitted by respirable (small airborne particles), inspirable ( intermediate size), direct-droplet-spray, and contact modes. These modes are affected by the features of the virus strain (infectivity, survivability, transferability, shedding profiles) and the host population. The environment (host density, surface area volume ratios, host movement patterns) has recently come into investigation. Here, we use a discrete-event, continuous-time, stochastic transmission model to analyze the environmental processes that affect the transmission of influenza. We find that the inspiratory route is more likely to cause high transmission isolation modes than the direct-d droplet spray mode. Depending on the context, the modes are sufficient to cause the high transmission, and contexts of transmission result. However, when making intervention decisions that involve blocking environmental pathways, generic recommendations can be applied indiscriminately and ineffective; instead, the intervention choice can be contextualized, depending on the specific features of people, virus strain, and the venue in question.",0.5088204145431519
"The intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii exploits cells of the immune system to disseminate and disseminate. During T.gondii-infection, γ–aminobutyric acid (GABA)/GABAA receptor signaling triggers a hypermigratory phenotype in dendritic cells (DCs) that are unknown signal transduction pathways. Here, we demonstrate that calcium (Ca2+) signaling in DCs is indispensable for T. gondiii-induced DC hypermotility transmigration in vitro. We show that activation of GABAA receptors and GABA induces transient Ca2+ entry into DCs and that DCs preferentially express the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2 + channel (VDCC) subtype Cav1.3. Silencing Cav2+ by short hairpin RNA and selective pharmacological antagonism of VDCCs abolished the Txoplasma-induced hypermigration phenotype. Our findings reveal a novel motility-related signaling axis that allows DCs to unveil interneurons of DCs that share common GABAergic motogenic pathways.",0.5088204145431519
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The disease is caused by mutations in the gut microbiome, which are associated with a variety of cancer-related genes, including MAPK and Wnt signaling. However, it is not clear how these mutations interact with the surrounding tumor microbiome. Here, we characterized the association between CRC microbial communities and tumor mutations using microbiome profiling-exome sequencing of 44 pairs of tumors matched to normal tissues. We found statistically significant associations between loss-of-function mutations in tumor genes and shifts in abundances of specific sets of bacterial taxa, suggestive of a functional interaction. This correlation allows us to statistically predict the interactions between loss and-function tumor mutations and cancer-associated genes and pathways. We also show that CRC microbiomes correlated with tumor mutational profiles, pointing to possible mechanisms of molecular interaction.",0.5088204145431519
"Malaria is a neglected tropical disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria in India. In this study, we describe the serological profiling of immune responses at malaria sites in India probing protein microarrays consisting of 515 and 500 of these proteins and 353 plasma samples. A total of 236 malaria-positive ( symptomatic and asymptomatic) and 117 malaria-negative samples were collected from field sites in Raurkela, Nadiad, Chennai. Indian samples showed significant seroreactivity of 265 and 373 P. vivax and P. falcaparum antigens, respectively. Overall, the overall levels of the immune responses were lower than those of the other two species of malaria parasite. We also identified the immunogenic and non-pathogenic antigen of the two major PlASmodium species recognized in India, which are associated with both symptomatic malaria and malaria. Our results suggest that targeted surveillance approaches tailored to diverse epidemiology of malaria are tailored to the malaria world.",0.5088204145431519
"Human β-defensin 3 (hBD3) is a cationic host defence peptide that is a highly copy number variable gene that is associated with autoimmune disease and psoriasis. HBD3 has been shown to influence the immune response to viral infection, but its increased copy number is not associated with the autoimmune disease. We investigated the effect of hBD3 on the response to the viral ligand polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) in human mouse primary cells. We found that the presence of polyI :C co-localises to the early endosome, suggesting that the absence of PolyI: C may have a significant phenotypic effect on response to infection and development of autoimmunity in humans.",0.5088204145431519
"The entropy metric derived from information theory provides a means to quantify information transmitted by acoustic streams like speech and music. We have systematically varying the entropy of pitch sequences in brain areas of neural activity and energetic demands to increase the function of entropy. The relationship predicted to occur between the efficient encoding mechanism and the computational resource of information present in the signal: specifically, the hypothesis of the relationship between the present planum temporale (PT) and the optimal encoding mechanism. In convergent functional MRI studies, we demonstrated a relationship between PT and optimal encoding, furthermore showing that the distributed fronto-parietal network retrieval of acoustic information is independent of the entropy. Our results establish that PT is an efficient neural engine that demands a computational resource to encode redundant signals with high information content.",0.5088204145431519
"Speech perception depends on combining sensory input with prior knowledge. However, the underlying mechanism by which sources of information are combined is unknown. In speech perception, there are functionally distinct coding schemes proposed by expectations that influence the representation of sensory evidence. Traditional models suggest that expected features of speech input are enhanced by sharpened interactive activation (Sharpened Signals). Conversely, Predictive Coding suggests expected features that are suppressed by unexpected features in speech input (Predict Errors) are processed. We present a new approach aimed at distinguishing accounts of prior knowledge that influence speech perception. By combining behavioural, univariate, and multivariate fMRI measures of sensory detail and prior expectations, we provide evidence to favour Prediction Error computations. Increased sensory detail, informative expectations, and additive behavioural and univariate neural effects improve the accuracy of a word report and reduce BOLD signal in the lateral temporal lobe regions. Our work establishes methods to distinguish representations of Prediction Error and Sharpening Signals in perceptual domains.",0.5088204145431519
"Proteins in the DJ-1 family are known to have many functional classes. However, their sequence and/or 3-D structure have not been determined. Functional assignment of sequence relationships is misleading, because structural similarity does not necessarily imply functional similarity. Proteins from the DJ family, known for their unknown function, are examples of proteins with sequence and fold similarity that span multiple functional classes and are available in three-dimensional structures. TheMATICS ( theoretical microscopic titration curves) is an electrostatics-based computational approach to functional site prediction, which sort proteins from different functional classes based on their structural alignment. Active site residues are predicted to be distinct from those predicted for different functional groups. Placement of predicted residues on the structural alignment of proteins reveals distinct types of active sites. The type of residues overlaps partially, but the residue common to the predicted residues belongs to a probable functional group. In this study, we show that proteins predicted for active sites have dimer interfaces, and that the predicted sites are contained in a subunit. The MATICS predicts a set of residues that are typical for the cysteine protease Protease; the prediction of PfpI/YhbO bears similarity with the predicted proteins. The computational prediction of functional sites in protein structures with unknown function provides valuable clues for functional classification.",0.5088204145431519
"Idiopathic chronic diarrhea (ICD) is a leading cause of morbidity in rhesus monkeys kept in captivity. In this study, we quantified bacterial 16S rRNA from pinch biopsies collected from colonoscopies following treatment, and found that induction of the mucosal TH2 response following helminth treatment was associated with a decrease in activated CD4+ and Ki67+ cells. In parallel, expression profiling and oligonucleotide microarrays and real-time PCR analysis revealed reductions in TH1-type inflammatory gene expression and increased expression of genes associated with IgE signaling, mast cell activation, eosinophil recruitment, alternative activation of macrophages, worm expulsion, and worm expulsion. Finally, we found that the composition of microbial communities attached to the intestinal mucosa was altered post-treatment. These findings suggest that helminths treatment can ameliorate ICD by restoring mucosal barrier functions and reducing overall bacterial attachment, altering communities of attached bacteria.",0.5088204145431519
"Wild birds have been implicated in the emergence of human livestock influenza virus (HIV) in recent years. However, successful prediction of viral spread and disease emergence is hampered by a critical lack of knowledge of viral movements and the subsequent risk posed by wild bird viruses. Here, we analyze genomic data from 287 newly sequenced avian influenza virus samples isolated over a 34-year period of continuous systematic surveillance of North American migratory birds. We use a Bayesian statistical framework to test hypotheses about viral migration, population structure and patterns of genetic reassortment. Our results reveal that despite high prevalence of Charadriiformes in the Delaware Bay host population, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes from Alberta are representative of AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseridae. AIV restricted to specific migratory flyways within a short time frame, and large-scale analysis showed long-term persistence of the virus in independent bird flyways and migration populations in North America. Our analysis provides vital insights to develop appropriately informed predictive models that are critical for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection.",0.5088204145431519
"Correct repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is critical for maintaining genome stability. DSBs are normally repaired by repair of error-free, repair break-induced replication (BIR), which is associated with non- reciprocal translocations and loss of heterozygosity. We have previously shown that the Recombination Execution Checkpoint (REC) mediates competition by preventing the BIR pathway from acting on DSB ends that are repaired by the GC. However, we found that when ends are engaged in a GC-compatible configuration, repair involving ends from different breaks can produce potentially deleterious translocations. In this study, we show that the kinetics of repair are markedly delayed when ends that participate in the GC belong to different DSB (called Trans) compared to the case where DSB end does not come from a break (Cis). Furthermore, when repair of Trans occurs after GC BIR, the overall efficiency of repair is comparable to that of repair of Cis. Finally, we find that the delay in repair appears to reflect tethering sequences that recombine at genomic locations that share sequence homology. These data support previous observations that ends of a DSB usually are tethered to tethering and that tethering facilitates ends encountering a donor sequence.",0.5088204145431519
"Insertion sequences are the simplest and most abundant form of transposable DNA found in bacterial genomes. They present multiple copies, thought to promote genomic plasticity and genetic exchange, a major force of evolutionary change. The main processes that determine the content of genomes, however, are still a matter of debate. In this work, we use large genomic data to estimate the abundance distributions of 33 families of 1811 bacterial chromosomes. We use simple models of dynamics to estimate key parameters. We find that the observed abundances are compatible with a neutral scenario where proliferation is controlled by deletions instead of purifying selection. In cases driven by selection, neutral behavior dominates large evolutionary scales. Our approach allows detection of recent expansions, supports the hypothesis that rapid expansions constitute transient events — punctuations—that occur when the state of coexistence is perturbated.",0.5088204145431519
"Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a major public health problem in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current influenza surveillance systems rely on the availability of information about the level of ILI in the population. However, current surveillance systems do not provide accurate information about ILI activity. Here, we introduce a novel method for estimating, near-real time, the level and intensity of influenza-related Wikipedia articles on a daily basis. We calculated the number of times certain influenza-health-related articles were accessed on a day in December 2007 and August 2013 compared to data from the official ILI and activity levels provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We developed a Poisson model that accurately estimates the level in the American population, weeks ahead of the CDC, and the absolute average difference between estimates was 0.27% for 294 weeks of data. Wikipedia-derived ILI models performed abnormally high media coverage events (2009 H1N1 pandemic) and unusually severe influenza seasons (2012–2013 influenza season). Wikipedia usage accurately estimated the week peak of influenza activity and 17% of Google Flu Trends data were accurate to measure ILI intensity. This study provides a novel tool for monitoring ILI levels and could be used to provide support for traditional influenza surveillance tools.",0.5088204145431519
"Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex encode space firing fields arranged on spatial hexagonal lattices. The spatial acuity of grid cells is determined by their capacity to transmit space information to place cells. In this paper, we investigate how grid cells encode space information in place cells by providing feed-forward input from place cells to the hippocampus. We find that the capacity of the grid cells to encode spatial information is dependent on the number of different spatial environments represented. We also find that spatial encoding of place code can be resilient to multiple remappings of place fields. We conclude that the spatial decoding of place information by grid cells can be robust to multiple spatial environments.",0.5088204145431519
"Aging is associated with highly reproducible DNA methylation (DNAm) changes, which contribute to the higher prevalence of malignant diseases in the elderly. In this study, we analyzed the epigenetic aging signatures of 5,621 DNAm profiles from 25 cancer types in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Overall, age-associated DNAm patterns hardly reflect the chronological age of cancer patients, but are coherently modified in a non- stochastic manner, particularly in CpGs hypermethylated in aging non-malignant tissues. Furthermore, the observed epigenetic age-predictions correlate with overall survival types of cancer (lower grade glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, esophageal carcinoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma), cutaneous melanoma, lung and squamous cell carcinomas, and neuroendocrine neoplasms). In conclusion, the age-related DNAm pattern of cancer is not related to chronological age in the patient, but is coordinately regulated, particularly by CpG hypermethylation and normal aging. Furthermore the apparent epigenetic changes correlate with clinical parameters and overall survival of cancer, indicating that regulation of DNAm and age-linked CpPs is relevant for cancer development.",0.5088204145431519
"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in infants, immunocompromised subjects, and the elderly. However, it is unclear whether primary RSV infections are associated with relatively mild symptoms, or result in severe lower respiratory tract infections and bronchiolitis. In this study, we tested whether bacterial Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists influence RSV-A2-GFP infection in human primary cells and cell lines. We found that the synthetic bacterial lipopeptide Pam3-Cys-Ser- Lys4 (Pam3CSK4), a prototype ligand of the heterodimeric TLR1/TLR2 complex, enhanced RSV infection in primary epithelial, myeloid, and lymphoid cells. Surprisingly, the enhancement of optimal viral binding was mediated by enhanced binding to RSV target cells. Interestingly, we also observed that the enhanced binding of the bacterial Lipopeptides to target cells was independent of TLR activation. These results suggest that the potential application of synthetic lipopes as adjuvants to live-attenuated viral vaccines may be explored.",0.5088204145431519
"Protein modifications regulate DNA repair levels through a pathway of choice. How the modification achieves these regulatory effects depends on how different modifications collaborate. Here, we show that sumoylation regulates double-strand break repair partly by modifying the end resection factor Sae2. This modification is conserved in yeast and humans, and induced DNA damage. We mapped the sumoylated site of Sae 2 to a single lysine self-association domain. Abolishing Sae1 by sumoylating the lysines arginine and mutating lysinine impaired the function of the enzyme in the processing of repair of multiple types of DNA breaks. We found that the effect of this modification is independent of phosphorylation, and that the modifications act synergy to increase the soluble forms of the protein. Our findings reveal a novel role for sumoylations in DNA repair by regulating the solubility of the end-resection factor. This collaboration between different modifications on multiple substrates leads to a stronger biological effect.",0.5088203549385071
"Malaria is a neglected tropical disease caused by the mosquito Plasmodium berghei. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito mosquito. The mosquito is responsible for the transmission of the malaria parasite to the mammalian host. During the life cycle of the mosquito, exocytosis of highly specialised secretory vesicles, osmiophilic bodies, is key for the dissolution of red blood cell and parasitophorous vacuole membranes enabling gamete egress. The positioning of adhesins in the TRAP family, micronemes on the sporozoite surface, is essential for gliding motility during parasite transmission to the mosquito and mammalian hosts. Here, we identify a conserved role for the putative pantothenate transporter PAT in the transmission process of malaria. PAT is present in distinct classes of vesicle membranes, including gametocytes and sporozoites. PAT-deficient gametes fail to discharge their contents, and remain intraerythrocytic and unavailable for fertilisation during development in the mosquito. Sporozoites lacking PAT fail to secrete TRAP, rendering them immotile and unable to infect the subsequent rodent host. Our results suggest that P. bergi PAT appears to regulate exocytic secretion of distinct populations of Vesicles in different life cycle forms acting as pantothensic transporter of parasite transmission.",0.5088204145431519
"Infections are a common cause of infant mortality worldwide, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae. Colonization is a prerequisite for invasive pneumococcal disease, particularly in prolonged children. However, the mechanisms underlying susceptibility are unknown. Here, we show that infant mice exhibit prolonged pneumococc carriage, delayed recruiting macrophages, effector cells for clearance, and in the nasopharyngeal lumen. The lack of macrophage recruitment paralleled a failure to upregulate chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2 (Ccl2 Mcp-1) in adult mice, which is required for clearance. Baseline expression of Ccl2 and related chemokines is higher in infant compared to the adult upper respiratory tract, and this effect requires the infant microbiota. Our results demonstrate that the signals governing macrophaging recruitment are altered in baseline infant mice, and that this effect prevents development of appropriate innate cell infiltration in response to pneumococcus colonization, delaying clearance of pneumococci.",0.5088204145431519
"Angiostrongylus costaricensis is a relatively uncharacterized nematode that causes abdominal angiostrabyliasis in Latin America, a human parasitic disease. Currently, no effective pharmacological treatment for angioplasty or other parasitic diseases exists. Peptidases are known to be druggable targets for a variety of diseases essential for the biological processes of parasites. In this study, we aimed to systematically characterize peptidase activity in different developmental stages of the parasite. We used a library of diverse tetradecapeptides incubated in cellular lysates of adult worms-stage larvae (L1) and cleaved peptide products identified by mass spectrometry. Lysates were treated with class specific peptidases inhibitors to determine the enzyme class responsible for proteolytic activity. We found that proteolysis activity of the major mechanistic classes (aspartic, metallo, and serine cysteine) was detected in adult worm lysate, aspartic and metallo serine-peptidase. In addition, substrate specificity profile was found to vary with different pH values. Our results suggest that peptididase signatures are important for the development of drug targets for human parasitic diseases.",0.5088204145431519
"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that causes birth defects in newborns and life-threatening complications in immunocompromised individuals. Unlike other human herpesviruses, HCMV contains a larger dsDNA genome and a similarly-sized capsid. However, little is known about how pp150, a tegument protein found in many cytomegaviruses, is required to stabilize the genome-containing capsid and stabilize viral replication. Here, we show that the smallest capsid protein (SCP), dispensable for herpes simplex virus type 1, can play an essential, undefined, role in HCMVs infection. Using cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM), we determine the three-dimensional structures of the HCMV capsid (pp150) and virion (p150) at sub-nanometer resolution. Comparison of structures reveals that pp150 is composed of helix bundles connected to a long central helix. Correlation of resolved helices and sequence-based secondary structure prediction maps the teguments density to the N-terminal half of pp150. These structures demonstrate that the SCP mediates interactions between the capsid with pp150 and the upper helix bundle.",0.5088204145431519
"Citrobacter rodentium is a pathogen that infects humans and animals and is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. It has been shown that the nervous system neurotransmitter acetylcholine plays an integral role in host defense against enteric bacterial pathogens. In this study, we report that acetylCHoline producing-T-cells, a non-neuronal source of ACh, are recruited to the colon during C. rodentium infection. We show that acetylecholine is produced by T-cells that exclusively belong to the Th subset and are able to produce IFNγ, IL-17A, and IL-22. In addition, we show that T-cell production is enhanced after C. rodentsium infection, and that this effect is associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and epithelial expression of antimicrobial peptides, compared to WT mice. Our findings suggest that acetylene is a key mediator of host-microbe interactions and mucosal defenses.",0.5088203549385071
"Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera in humans and animals. Cholera toxin (CT) and toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) are the primary virulence factors. CT causes profuse watery diarrhea, while TCP ( composed of repeating copies of major pilin TcpA) is required for intestinal colonization. Antibodies to CT and TcpB protect mice from infection. We developed a vaccine that elicits anti-CTB antibodies in mice and evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of this vaccine in an infant mouse model of the disease. Adult female CD-1 mice were immunized intraperitoneally and three times more times than mice immunized with the same combination of CT and TCB. The immunization of dams with the TCPA+CTB mixture was comparable to that of those immunized against the TcpC-FliC and flagellin subunit of FliC adjuvant, CTB. Blood and fecal samples were analyzed for antigen-specific IgG and IgA, respectively, and quantitative ELISA. Immunized females mated; reared offspring were challenged orogastrically for 10 to 20 LD50 with V. cholae El Tor N16961; vaccine efficacy was assessed in the challenged pups 48 hrs after immunization. Weight loss analysis showed that immunization with the dams with both the CTA-A2-TcpB and chimera and the TCB mixture protected pups from excess weight loss and severe diarrhea. These data support the concept of including Tcpa and CTB immunogens in the development of an effective multivalent subunit vaccine against V.cholerae.",0.5088204145431519
"Cell differentiation is a process in which the DNA is repressed by DNA regulatory regions, which is essential for cell survival and differentiation. Chromatin remodelers, BAF complexes, are responsible for establishing nucleosome occupancy patterns, which are key for epigenetic regulation of DNA methylation and histone modifications. In this study, we have assessed the roles of BAF complex subunits in stemness and differentiation in murine embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that SNF5, a core subunit of the BAFcomplex, negatively regulates OCT4 levels in pluripotent cells, and is critical for cell fate determination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this subunit is responsible for generating NDRs at regulatory sites of OCT4 repressed target genes, including PAX6 and NEUROG1, and crucial for gene fate determination in the cell. These results highlight the importance of SNFF5 in regulating the expression of genes activated by repressed OCT4.",0.5088204145431519
"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most virulent pathogens in the world. The bacterium is resistant to many antimicrobials, including daptomycin, but the mechanism by which this resistance is achieved remains incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the hydrophilic C-terminal domain of MprF is sufficient for lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) production and that Lys-PG production is required for efficient CAMP resistance. We also show that the membrane-level lys-piggycerol production of Lys- PG is essential for Lys-G production. Notably, Lys-Piggyc production was required to lead to efficient and efficient resistance to CAMP. Furthermore, the large N-terminally hydrophobic domain of the large membrane protein was absent, indicating a crucial role for this protein in the bacterial immune evasion mechanism. Our study unravels the crucial details of the molecular basis of this bacterial immunity evasion mechanism and may help to employ MprFs to target new anti-virulence drugs.",0.5088204145431519
"In eukaryotic genomes, the binding sites of regulatory elements are often located at specific locations in the genome. In this study, we describe a new flexible framework for modeling binding site evolution in multiple related genomes, based on a phylogenetic pair of hidden Markov models that explicitly model the gain loss of binding sites in the phylogeny. We demonstrate the value of the framework for alignment of regulatory regions in inference of precise binding-site locations in regions of the DNA. Our implementation is scalable in terms of numbers of species sequence lengths and can produce alignments with binding- site predictions with accuracy rivaling that of current systems that specialize in alignment with binding site prediction. We also demonstrate the validity of the power of the model components and extensive simulations of realistic sequence data to apply specific models to study Drosophila enhancers related to the presence of gain loss binding sites. Different models can be easily specified, providing an invaluable tool for exploration of biological hypotheses that drive improvements in understanding the mechanisms of evolution and gene regulation.",0.5088204145431519
"Age-related changes in motor response to noise have been observed in a number of studies. However, it is not clear how age-related age changes affect motor responses to noise. In this study, we used a Bayesian quadratic optimality approach to construct a model of motor response in the face of noise. We show that the model is consistent with the observed age-associated increase in latency onset of response perturbation, and a substantial slowing of response response. The model is tractable and can be used to quantitatively formulate a long-standing hypothesis of age-induced slowing adaptation to increased noise.",0.5017242431640625
"Yellow fever (Yf) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the bite of a mosquito. Yf has been reported in South Omo in Southern Ethiopia since the 1960s. However, reliable information about the level of community knowledge and attitudes about the disease in the area is not available. In this study, we conducted a community-based cross-sectional survey of 612 randomly selected adults interviewed about Yf. Of the 612 study participants, 508 (83.0%) reported having heard of Yf locally known as “the disease causes vomiting and blood”. Ninety-eight (90.4%) of study participants said Yf is different from malaria and thirteen (41.9%) of participants said that Yf was transmitted to a patient person, 80 (37.6%) mentioned disease transmitted to mosquitoes by bite, and 333 (65.7%) study participants believed Yf to be a preventable disease, 280 (84.1%) mentioned a vaccine as a preventive method. The majority believed the disease killer (97.2%) was newly emerging and 69.4% were newly emerging. Our findings indicate that community members have a low level of overall knowledge about the Yf, especially the cause, mode of transmission and preventive methods.",0.5017242431640625
"Legionella pneumophila is an accidental intracellular pathogen that infects humans. The bacterium has been known to infect humans for hundreds of generations, but it has never been studied in humans. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that restricting L. pneumophil growth in mouse macrophages over hundreds of years led to improved replication of macrophage. Based on our results, we provide a detailed view of population dynamics in experimentally evolving bacterial population, punctuated by frequent instances of transient clonal interference and selective sweeps. Non- synonymous point mutations in the flagellar regulator, fleN, resulted in increased uptake of lysine and broadly increased replication in macrophaging and amoebae. Mutations in multiple steps of the lysines biosynthesis pathway were independently isolated, resulting in increased replication of amoaebae and reduced replication of the macrophae. Our results demonstrate that, in laboratory conditions, host restriction is sufficient to rapidly modify L. pneumoniaophila fitness in the host range.",0.5017242431640625
"Molecular recognition of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) commonly involves specific localized contacts in target-induced disorder and order transitions. However, IDPs remain in a disordered bound state, a phenomenon coined “fuzziness”, characterized by IDP polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity and dynamic ensemble disordered and bound-state conformations. In general, specific biophysical models of fuzzy interactions are lacking. Here, we show that the transcriptional activation domain of the Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein family (EAD) IDP exhibits features of fuzziness, including multiple EAD aromatic chains driving molecular recognition. Considering the prevalent role of cation-π interactions in protein-protein interfaces, we hypothesized that EAD-target binding involves polycation- π contacts in the disordered EAD basic residues of the target. We evaluated this hypothesis in a functional theoretical interrogation of EAD variants. Our experimental effects range from EAD sequence variations, including aromatic number, aromatic density, and charge perturbations, support the cation–pi� model. Moreover, the activity trends observed were captured in a coarse-grained EAD chain model corresponding to an analytical model based on interaction between EAD aromatics and surface cations of the generic globular target. Our results provide a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition of polyvalent IDPs.",0.5017242431640625
"Cytosine methylation of DNA is an important epigenetic gene silencing mechanism in plants, fungi, and animals. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, nearly all DNA methylations occur in transposon relics and repetitive sequences. However, DNA methylation does not depend on the canonical RNAi pathway. In this study, we describe a new type of methylation associated with disiRNA loci. Unlike previously known DNA-methylation in Neurospora, disiRNAs are highly dynamic and regulated by a mechanism called DLDM. We show that DLDMs is triggered by convergent transcription of enriched promoter regions. Our results establish a new mechanism that triggers DNA methylating.",0.5017242431640625
"Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase negative bacterial pathogen that is particularly associated with severe cases of infectious endocarditis. In this study, we have duplicated the isd locus of this bacterium and duplicated it in the HKU09-01 duplication. The isd is intrinsically unstable and undergoes accordion-like amplification segregation leading to extensive isd copy number variation. Amplification of the locus increased the level of expression of Isd proteins and improved the binding of hemoglobin to the cell surface of S. lugdungensis. Furthermore, Isd overexpression provided an advantage to strains competing with limited hemoglobin as the sole source of iron. Gene duplications amplifications (GDA) events are a fundamental importance in bacterial evolution and are frequently associated with antibiotic resistance and species of antibiotic resistance. This is the first time that a virulence factor of a Gram-positive pathogen can link GDA directly to its competitive advantage against bacteria struggling with selective pressures mimicking “nutritional immunity”.",0.5017242431640625
"The dendritic tree is an extensive network of synapses that is required for computation in the brain. Dendritic tapering away from soma is suggested to equalise contributions from synapses at different locations to maximise current transfer of soma. We find that this is achieved precisely, and that an asymptotic approximation accurately matches results from numerical simulations. We also find that a simple quadratic form matches diameters obtained experimentally, indicating that the fundamental architectural principle of the brain links dendrites diameters to signal transmission.",0.5017246603965759
"Loiasis filarial infection is an endemic tropical disease in Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Repeated treatments of ivermectin are delivered in an annual community directed treatment with ivermicectin (CDTI) approach for years to control onchocerciasis of Loa loa-Onchocerca volvulus in co-endemic areas. However, the impact of CDTI on loiasis and parasitological indicators is not known. In this study, we designed a cross sectional study to explore the effects of rounds of CDT on loiiasis and parasites. We recruited 3,684 individuals from 36 communities in 3 CDTI projects in Cameroon and 9 villages in a non-CDTI district. We found that loiasis prevalence was 29.3% (range = 24.2%–34.6%) in the non- CDTI district and 16.0% (3.3%,–26.6%) in the CDTI in the West and 10 in the Northwest Southwest 2 districts, with reductions of 30.5%, 17.9%, 8.1%, and 7.8% (compared to 14 rounds) registered post CDTI, respectively. Similar trends in infection intensity and infection intensity were observed at both sites. We also found a negative relationship between adherence to ivermiectin treatment and the prevalence/intensity of infection at the two sites.",0.5017242431640625
