"Henipaviruses are a family of paramyxoviridae that cause fatal disease in humans and mammals. Henipaviruses have been identified as a potential target for new anti-viral therapies. We performed genome-wide high-throughput screens to identify host-encoded microRNAs (s) impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. We found that members of the family-181-1793 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection. Infection promotion primarily mediated by the ability-181 significantly enhances henipavirus-induced membrane fusion. We also identified novel negative regulators of henipavirus fusion, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of Ephs contributes to enhanced infection fusion.",0.4888240098953247
"Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are vectors of a number of diseases, including dengue fever, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the most common mosquito species in the world, and the most important vectors of dengue fever, malaria, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are currently being developed as genetically engineered underdominance killer-rescue gene drive systems. In this paper, we explore the effects of population genetics on the dynamics of the killer-rescue gene drive system. We show that the effects of population genetics on the dynamics of the killer-rescue gene drive system can be disentangled from the effects of ecological factors.

"Taenia serialis is a parasitic worm that infects a wide range of mammals, birds, and reptiles, including humans. The larval stage of Taenia serialis is commonly parasitized by rodents and lagomorphs, reported from a wide range of hosts including geladas (Theropithecus gelada), primates endemic to Ethiopia. Geladas exhibit protuberant larval cysts indicative of advanced T. serialis infection associated with high mortality. The non-protuberant larvae develop deep tissue abdominal cavity, leading to an underestimate of prevalence based solely on observable cysts. We adapted a non-invasive antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect circulating Taenia antigen in gelada urine. Analysis revealed that the assay was highly accurate in detecting Taenia antigen, 98.4 % specificity, 98.5 % sensitivity, and the area curve was 0.99. The assay was used to investigate the prevalence of T. serialis infection in a wild gelada population, finding infection substantially widespread in the occurrence of visible T. serialis cysts ( 16.4 % tested positive, 6 % population exhibited cysts). We also examined the sex bias of T. serialis infection and found significant sex bias in cyst antigen presence.",0.4887125492095947

"Expression of un-utilised protein (benefits of current environment) incurs quantifiable fitness costs in cellular growth rates. However, the magnitude of variability in un-utilised protein expression in natural settings is largely unknown. We address this challenge by combining global proteomics data with a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli to compute the environment-specific cost utility of proteome gene basis. We find that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments, accounting for more than 95 % of the variance in growth rates.

"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a pathogen that causes disease in humans and animal hosts. Host-to-host transmission of the pathogen is a striking feature of the disease transmission heterogeneity in host infectiousness. The proposed host population is a group of 20 % infected hosts, termed super-shedders, responsible for 80 % of the disease transmission. In this study, we studied the immune state of super-shedders in a model of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We found that mice infected with super-shedders had a dampened immune response to the gastrointestinal tract spleen and a dampened immune response to the secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, we found that neutrophils blunted the IL-2-mediated proliferation of TH1 cells in spleen-infected super-shedders. We also found that depletion of neutrophils led to an increase in the number of T- bet+ TH1 cells and restored their ability to respond to IL-2.

The circadian clock displays the self-sustained 24-hour periodicity of temperature and light, as well as the self-sustained 24-hour periodicity of temperature and light. This self-sustained 24-hour periodicity of temperature and light is compensated by the self-sustained 24-hour periodicity of temperature and light. In this study, we derive a dynamic model of a biochemical oscillator reconstituted in vitro from purified proteins, which accurately reproduces the rhythms of the circadian clock. We also apply perturbation analyses to study the resetting characteristics of the circadian clock.",0.4918052554130554
"Genomic mapping of DNA replication origins (ORIs) in mammals provides powerful means to understand regulatory complexity in the genome. Here, we combine genome-wide analysis with molecular analysis of distinct classes of ORIs according to location relative to genes, to identify preferential sites of DNA replication initiation in 0.4 % of mouse genome. We show that nearly half of the ORIs map promoter regions, interestingly, ORI density strongly correlates with promoter density, reflecting coordinated organisation of replication transcription in the mouse genome. Detailed analysis of ORI activity showed CpG island promoter-ORIs efficient ORIs ES cells ORI specification firing efficiency maintained cell types, suggesting co-evolution of regulatory regions driving replication transcription. Remarkably, distribution of replication initiation sites promoter-ORIs exactly parallels transcription start sites (TSS), suggesting co-evolution of regulatory regions driving replication transcription.",0.49067413806915283
"Skeletal muscle morphogenesis transforms short muscle precursor cells into long, multinucleate myotubes that anchor myotendinous junction (MTJ) tendons. In vertebrates, great deal is known about muscle specification somitic cells, but little is known about the cellular mechanisms that generate long muscle short cells. Here, we show that zebrafish fast muscle fiber morphogenesis consists of discrete phases: short precursor cells, intercalation / elongation, boundary capture, and myotube formation. The second phase, intercalation / elongation, proceeds-step process: protrusion extension filling. The third phase, protrusion extension filling, proceeds-step process: boundary capture. Finally, ends muscle fiber anchor MTJ (boundary capture) and undergo morphogenetic changes adopt stereotypically, cylindrical shape myotubes. We find that the basement membrane protein laminin is required for efficient elongation, proper fiber orientation, and boundary capture. Furthermore, laminin is a novel molecular cue mediating fiber orientation limiting muscle cell length.",0.49075886607170105
"Stem cells are the most abundant cells in the human body. However, the dynamics of stem cells are not well understood. In this study, we developed a new method to study stem cells in the mouse colon using stem cell markers. We found that stem cells in the mouse colon accumulate mutations in microsatellites, and that the accumulation of microsatellites plays a major role in the maintenance of the colon crypts. We also found that stem cells in the mouse colon are separated into small domains and share a common ancestor. We gained new data demonstrating colon epithelium clustered separately with hematopoietic cell types, indicating that colon constituted progenitors ruling significant renewal of the colonic epithelium hematopoietic cells in adulthood. Overall, this study demonstrates the reliability of cell lineage reconstruction to study stem cell dynamics, and addresses open questions about colon stem cells.",0.4918600916862488

"Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease caused by haemorrhagic fever and is endemic in Guinea, West Africa. The 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak in Guinea was one of the most devastating in recent history, resulting in the deaths of more than 10,000 people and the spread of HAT to coastal districts of Boffa, Dubreka, and Forecariah, major foci of HAT, particularly in coastal districts of Boffa, Dubreka, and Forecariah. This study aimed to assess the impact of the Ebola outbreak on HAT screening and care activities in Guinea, and to compare HAT treatment characteristics with the Ebola outbreak period according to available data. We found that the number of people screened for HAT during the Ebola outbreak was significantly lower than during the pre-Ebola period, and the proportion of patients attending post-treatment follow-up visits was significantly lower than during the Ebola outbreak period.

"Annual plants and perennial plants divide their life cycles into vegetative and flowering phases. Previously, the environmental cues that control the life histories of annuals and perennials have been studied in detail. Here, we show that natural genetic variation conferring differences in the perennial life cycle of Arabis alpina is associated with differences in the flowering phase of the plant. We show that a single gene, PEP1, encodes a box transcription factor that represses the flowering phase of A. thaliana. This gene encodes the MADS box transcription factor LOCUS C, which is required for the flowering phase of A. thaliana. We also show that the PEP1 locus contains a tandem arrangement length and partial PEP1 copy, suggesting that variation in the PEP1 locus arises independently of time. Our results provide a paradigm for the phenotypic variation found in herbaceous perennial species.",0.49186429381370544
"DNA methylomes are an important tool for the study of bacterial genomes. They are characterized by the presence of a large number of epigenetic marks, which can be detected by DNA sequencing. However, most methylomes are not sensitive enough to detect common epigenetic marks (ie N6-methyladenine, N4-methylcytosine, and 4 mC). Here, we used Single- Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) to determine the methylomes of Mycoplasma genitalium G-37 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a human pathogen.

"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly, in babies born to mothers infected with the virus during pregnancy. Zika virus infection during pregnancy is challenging to cross-react with dengue virus (DENV) in newborns, and it is difficult to determine the time of ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Here, we describe the maternal-fetal transfer antibodies (MFATs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) of ZIKV in neonates of mothers infected with the virus during the 2016 Zika microcephaly outbreak in Northeast Brazil. We found that maternal-fetal transfer antibodies (MFATs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) of ZIKV in neonates of mothers infected with the virus during the 2016 Zika microcephaly outbreak in Northeast Brazil were slightly higher in mothers with microcephaly than in mothers without microcephaly.

"Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes severe morbidity and mortality in Africa. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and is a major cause of mortality in Europe. The mechanism of action of Trypanosoma brucei is poorly understood. We have identified a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, Tb14, as a prime candidate to mediate action of anti-parasite choline analogs. Depletion of Tb14 in the bloodstream of Trypanosoma brucei parasites increased resistance to the anti-parasite choline analogs 7 - fold 3 and 13 - fold, respectively, compared to uninduced cells. Furthermore, depletion of Tb14 in the bloodstream of Trypanosoma brucei parasites increased parasite susceptibility to the anti-parasite choline analogs 7 - fold 3 and 13 - fold, respectively, compared to uninduced cells.

"The long-distance chromosomal interactions between cells have been shown to regulate gene expression. However, the extent to which these long-distance interactions regulate gene expression remains unclear. Here, we developed a medium-variable throughput assay to screen for functional long-distance interactions that affect the average expression level of reporter gene cell-to-cell variability (noise) in a single cell. We found that the expression level of reporter gene cell-to-cell variability (noise) is affected by the activity of the MET3 promoter (Met3pr), which is located at a distance of 1 kb from the genome. We also found that the MET3pr activity case exhibits distinct patterns including low expression / high noise, low expression / low noise, high expression / low noise, and high expression / low noise. We also found that the clustering of genes in the native genome enhances transcription of endogenous MET4 - targeted genes.

The rK39 immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic test (RDT) based on rK39 is a fragment of kinesin-related gene derived from Brazilian L. chagasi, recognised as L. infantum, originating in Europe. Despite reliability in South Asia, rK39 test reported lower sensitivity in East Africa. Here, we analysed the diversity of rK39 sequences in East African and South Asian L. donovani strains. We found that East African strains display significant diversity in the rK39 sequence compared to South Asian strains. The diversity of rK39 sequences in East African and South Asian L. donovani strains is sufficient to influence the performance of rK39 in East Africa.",0.48276424407958984

"DNA synthesis is a critical step in the progression of many diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms by which DNA synthesis is regulated are poorly understood. Here, we show that a subset of replication stress cells, known as Rrm3, controls the origin of DNA synthesis. The N-terminal domain of Rrm3 is required for control of DNA synthesis and maps residues 186–212 critical for repair of the Orc origin recognition associates complex. We show that Rrm3 is physically separable to the Orc origin recognition associates complex, and that the N-terminal domain of Rrm3 is required for control of DNA synthesis and maps residues 186–212 critical for repair of the Orc origin recognition associates complex.

"American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis. ATL is caused by infection with the parasite Leishmania amazonensis. ATL is caused by the overexpression of the cytokine Interleukin-32 (IL-32). IL-32 is a cytokine involved in host defense against Leishmania. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-32 in infection by silencing overexpression of IL-32 in macrophages infected with Leishmania amazonensis. We found that overexpression of IL-32 in macrophages infected with Leishmania amazonensis is closely related to the cytokine IL-8. We also found that overexpression of IL-32 in macrophages infected with Leishmania amazonensis is regulated by nitric oxide and cathelicidin -defensin 2. Mechanistically, effects explained by nitric oxide and cathelicidin -defensin 2 production regulated IL-32. Thus, IL-32 is a crucial cytokine involved in host defense against Leishmania.",0.4827648401260376

"bubonic plague is a highly virulent disease that is endemic in many parts of the world. However, the factors responsible for its persistence are poorly known. Classically, plague persistence is suspected to be coexistence between plague resistant susceptible rodents and natural reservoirs, and/or metapopulation structure. However, the effect of these two factors on plague persistence is not well understood. In this paper, we analyse the dynamics of plague propagation in Madagascar, a major focus disease endemic in the central highlands of the country. We combine deterministic analyses with sensitivity analyses to find that plague endemicity favoured intermediate host population sizes and that the presence of resistant rats sufficient explain the long-term persistence of plague. We also find that plague endemicity accounts for plague endemicity thanks to a reduction in the size of subpopulations, extinction-recolonization dynamics and disease dynamics.",0.48287829756736755
"Categorization is an important cognitive process that corrects stimulus challenging categories overlapping boundaries. In perceptual categorization, the correct categorization stimulus is challenging categories overlapping boundaries. In this study, we tested whether human subjects learn to use category distributions prior to probabilities. We asked subjects to classify frequency tone burst overlapping, uniform categories according to perceived tone frequency. systematically varied prior probability presenting tone burst frequency originating versus category. We measured subject frequency-thresholds discrimination and sensory uncertainty levels and found that subjects learned changes in prior probabilities early in testing information influence categorization. We found that a Bayesian model led to optimal sub-optimal decision behavior (i.e. probability matching). We also found that probability matching provided better account for human decision behavior than a model that fits confirmed subjects able to learn category prior probabilities approximate forms of category distributions.",0.48239395022392273
"Haemophilus pharyngitis is the most common cause of acute otitis media in the United States.

"Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular protozoan parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a group of unicellular parasites, flagellated parasites responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. One of the major aspects of parasite pathogenicity is the remodelling of the cytoskeleton, which occurs in life cycle parasite accompanied by major changes in the morphology of the organelle. The flagellar pocket (FP) remains attached to the cell body flagellum attachment zone (FAZ) and is responsible for invagination of the pellicular membrane sole site endo-exocytosis. The flagellar pocket collar (FPC) is a cytoskeletal structure called flagellar pocket collar (FPC). The distal end of the FP is essential for intracellular, cytoskeletal structure called flagellar pocket collar (FPC). Overlapping the FPC hook complex (HC) (sub-structure previously named as bilobe) is essential thought involved protein FP entry into the FP.

"The human Y chromosome exhibits surprisingly low levels of genetic diversity. This is due to neutral processes that reduce the number of male offspring relative to the number of female offspring. Alternatively, selection acting on new mutations, affecting linked neutral sites, reduces the variability of Y chromosome. In this study, we combine extensive genome-wide analyses of X, Y, and mitochondrial DNA with extensive population genetic simulations to show that the low observed Y chromosome variability is consistent with a purely neutral model. We show that the number of sites estimated to purify selection greatly exceeds the number of Y-linked coding sites, suggesting that highly repetitive ampliconic regions are important. We exclude the possibility that positive selection acting on beneficial mutations reduced the diversity of linked neutral regions, contributing to lowering human Y chromosome diversity.",0.4882117807865143
"Plasmodium vivax, the causative agent of malaria, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and sub-Saharan Africa. The recent emergence of drug-resistant P. vivax parasites in Southeast Asia has raised questions about the role of genes involved in drug resistance in P. vivax biology. In this study, we used Plasmodium knowlesi, a closely related species of P. vivax, as a model system to test the role of genes involved in drug resistance in P. vivax biology. Expression of 14 P. vivax genes, including allelic variants hypothetically involved in drug resistance, was assessed in the model system. We found that the expression level of these genes was higher in P. knowlesi than in P. vivax orthologous species, suggesting that genes previously unlocalised in P. vivax proteins may be involved in drug resistance. We also performed chloroquine mefloquine drug assay in P. knowlesi, finding significant differences in drug sensitivity, despite positive selection pressure in Southeast Asia. Our data confirm that P. knowlesi is a useful tool for studying P. vivax biology.",0.48847582936286926
"The immune system of plants and animals is divided into two distinct groups: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. In plants, the innate immune system is activated by the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (IORs) and the adaptive immune system is activated by the IORs. In mammals, the IORs are activated by the coiled-coil (CC) domain, similar to that found in mammals and fungi. Here, we report that the non-cluster RESISTANCEONOSPORA PARASITICA 7 (RPW8) and HOMOLOG RPW8 (HR) confer broad-spectrum resistance to oomycetes. We show that the CC domain of the RPW8/HR proteins is similar to that of the coiled-coil domain of the MLKL HET-S mammals fungi. We also show that the CC domain of the RPW8/HR proteins is similar to that of the coiled-coil domain of the MLKL HET-S mammals fungi.

We use a dynamical model of spiking neurons to study the response of excitatory cells to an asymmetric sawtooth stimulus. We find that excitatory cells respond to the onset of the stimulus by firing a single spike of gamma cycle, depending on tuning properties of the temporal structure specific to the input; identity of the stimulus coded on the listit excatory cells fire cycle.

"The human herpesvirus (HSV) is the most common virus in the world, and it has been shown to be involved in the development of a wide range of human diseases, including cancer. However, the role of herpesvirus lytic replication remains elusive. In the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) model, we show that the master regulator of lytic replication, RTA, interacts with STAT6 to promote 48 (K48) and K63-linked ubiquitylation of the STAT6 degradationsome lysosome systems. In addition, we show that degradation of STAT6 dramatically associated increased ubiquitylated form of the tripartite motif family like 2 ( TRIML2) with prolonged cell survival virion production and, commonly observed, lytic activation of Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and cytomegalovirus. Our results suggest that degradation of STAT6 is important for lytic activation of KSHV, an attractive therapeutic target.",0.48855894804000854

"Human -defensin 3 (hBD3) is a cationic host defence peptide that plays a key role in the innate immune response to viral infection. HBD3 is a highly copy number variable gene that influences the cellular responses to mimic viral polyI: C. In this study, we investigated the effect of hBD3 on primary macrophages in response to viral mimic polyI: C. We found that hBD3 exacerbated the production of Interferon-, a type of chemokine that is required for the innate immune response to viral infection. We also found that hBD3 increased the localisation of polyI: C in primary macrophages. We also found that hBD3 suppressed the cytoplasmic response mediated by TICAM1 (TRIF) and IFIH1 (IFIH1 / CARDIF).

"Speech perception relies on the combination of sensory input and prior knowledge. However, the underlying mechanism of the sources of information combined with the underlying mechanism of the representation of sensory evidence is unknown. Traditional models suggest that expected features of speech input are enhanced by sharpened interactive activation (Sharpened Signals), while Predictive Coding suggests that expected features are suppressed by suppressed features of speech input (Predicted Errors). In this work, we combine behavioural, uni, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure sensory detail prior to expectations of speech perception. We show that increased sensory detail enhances speech information measured in the posterior superior temporal sulcus region of the brain, whereas increased sensory detail reduces speech information measured in the posterior superior temporal sulcus region of the brain.

"Idiopathic chronic diarrhea (Idiopathic colitis) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in rhesus monkeys, and is caused by exposure to whipworm Trichuris trichiura. In this study, we investigated the effects of helminth treatment on the intestinal mucosa of rhesus monkeys. We found that the intestinal mucosa of rhesus monkeys treated with helminth was reduced in the presence of whipworm Trichuris trichiura. Furthermore, we found that the intestinal mucosa of rhesus monkeys treated with helminth was significantly enriched in Streptophyta phylum Cyanobacteria and Tenericutes.

"Influenza is a major threat to human health and the livestock industry, and the emergence of avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild birds has been linked to the emergence of human livestock influenza (HLI) in the United States and Canada in recent years. However, the patterns of viral spread and subsequent risk posed by wild bird viruses remain unpredictable. In this study, we analyzed genomic data from 287 newly sequenced avian influenza virus (AIV) samples isolated from 34 years of continuous systematic surveillance of North American migratory birds.

"Bacterial genomes are the most abundant form of transposable DNA found in the world. They contain a large number of insertion sequences, which are the simplest forms of transposable DNA found in bacteria. The main processes that determine the content of bacterial genomes are duplication, lateral gene transfer, deletion, and purifying selection. Here, we use large genomic data from 33 families of bacterial chromosomes to study the roles of duplication, lateral gene transfer, deletion, and purifying selection in determining the content of bacterial genomes. We find that in cases driven by selection, the neutral behavior dominates large evolutionary scales. However, in cases driven by lateral gene transfer, deletion, and purifying selection, hosts tend to coexist in a dynamic equilibrium state time. This approach allows detection of recent expansions, supports hypothesis rapid expansions constitute transient events that are punctuations in the state coexistence of host and perturbed.",0.4918951690196991
