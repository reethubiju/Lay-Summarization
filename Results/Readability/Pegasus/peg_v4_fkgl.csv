A deeper understanding of the interaction between the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is critical for the selection of tumour biomarkers and for the future development of therapies. Human tumour specimens and cell lines contain a plethora of genetic and epigenetic changes, which complicate data analysis. In contrast, mouse tumour models such as the APCMin mouse used in this study arise by a single initiating genetic mutation, yet share key traits with human cancer. Here we show that mouse adenomas acquire a multitude of epigenetic alterations, which are recurring in mouse adenoma and in human colon cancer, representing early and advanced tumours, respectively. The use of a mouse model thus allowed us to uncover a sequence of epigenetic changes occurring in tumours, which may facilitate the identification of novel clinical colon cancer biomarkers.","Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that occur during the initiation and progression of cancer. However, it is not well understood how epigenetic changes occur in the early stages of cancer development. Here, we show that a large set of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are present in the intestinal adenoma of a mouse model of colon cancer. These DMRs are highly enriched in DNA methyltransferases-regulated adenoma cells. We also show that these DMRs are frequently found in colon cancer, rare in adenoma. These data allow the distinction between early and late epigenetic alterations occurring in intestinal adenoma, and facilitate selection of specific clinical epigenetic biomarkers.",11.581666666666667

It is believed that the host immune response and genetic diversity of the parasite play an important role in the progression of Chagas disease, which presents a variety of clinical forms ranging from indeterminate to cardiac and digestive forms. Since parasite genetic diversity may influence the development of Chagas disease, our study aims to understand the immune response of human peripheral blood cells upon infection with two T. cruzi strains with different genetic backgrounds (Col cl1.7 – Tc I, and Y strain – TcII). Our study showed differences in the expression of cytokines and activation molecules between cells infected with strains from Tc I (Col cl1.7) and Tc II (Y strain). These data show the importance of parasite strain in the development of the host response early in infection, which may influence the clinical progression of Chagas disease.","Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi.

Until now, experiments with genetically disrupted mice have been reported for all but pol ν, encoded by the POLN gene. To intensively analyze the role of mammalian pol ν we generated multiple Poln-deficient murine models. We discovered that Poln is uniquely upregulated during testicular development and that it is enriched in spermatocytes. This, and phylogenetic analysis indicate a testis-specific function. We observed a modest reduction in meiotic recombination at a recombination hotspot in Poln-deficient mice. Pol ν has been suggested to function in DNA crosslink repair. However, we found no increased DNA crosslink sensitivity in Poln-deficient mice or POLN-depleted human cells. This is a major difference from some previous findings, and we support our conclusion by multiple experimental approaches, and by the very low or absent expression of functional pol ν in mammalian somatic cells. The present work represents the first description and comprehensive analysis of mice deficient in pol ν, and the first thorough phenotypic analysis in human cells.","DNA  (Poln) is a member of the POLN family of genes and is encoded by the POLN gene, which encodes the DNA  (Poln) family of genes.

To rationally design vaccines, antigens and, frequently, adjuvants must be selected to trigger appropriate immune responses against a specific pathogen. We selected dengue-2 envelope protein domain III as a dengue vaccine candidate and expressed this candidate in the lipidated form in an Escherichia coli-based system. Dengue envelope protein domain III mediates binding of the dengue virus to the host cellular receptor. The lipid moiety of the bacterial-derived lipoprotein can activate the innate immune system to elicit an appropriate adaptive immune response. We demonstrated that lipidated dengue-2 envelope protein domain III is more immunogenic than nonlipidated dengue-2 envelope protein domain III. Most importantly, the lipidated dengue-2 envelope protein domain III alone triggered a durable neutralizing antibody response with a low risk of severe side effects. Lipidated subunit vaccines are non-replicating and thus may be less susceptible to replication interference than live attenuated vaccines.

Extracellular factors frequently induce heterogeneous responses, thereby restricting the biological outcome to a fraction of the cell population. However, the question arises how such cell-to-cell variability can be controlled, because some cellular systems show a very homogenous response at a defined level of an extracellular stimulus. We derived an analytical framework to systematically characterize the cell-to-cell variability of intracellular signaling pathways which transduce external signals. We analyzed how heterogeneity arises from fluctuations in the total concentrations of signaling proteins because this is the main source of variability in eukaryotic systems. We find that signaling pathways can be highly variable or inherently invariant, depending on the kinetic parameters and the structural features of the cascade. Our results indicate that the cell-to-cell variability can be reduced by negative feedback in the cascade or by signaling crosstalk between parallel pathways. We precisely define the role of negative feedback loops in variability suppression, and show that different aspects of the dose-response curve can be controlled, depending on the feedback kinetics and site of action in the cascade. This work constitutes a first step towards a systematic understanding of cell-to-cell variability in signal transduction.","Cells reliably sense environmental changes despite internal fluctuations, and mechanisms underlying robustness remain unclear.

We are interested in understanding the immune mechanisms that can control infection. Preliminary studies suggested that CD8+ T cells can kill parasites and limit disease; however, studying these important killer cells has been hindered, because we do not know what parasite molecules they recognize. To overcome this, we engineered parasites to express ovalbumin. Since many tools exist to track and measure immune cells targeted at ovalbumin, we can now track the specific CD8+ T cell responses that develop upon infection with Leishmania. We found that Leishmania initially induced CD8+ T cells to divide and produce molecules such as IFN-gamma that may help them to kill parasites. However, the CD8+ T cells rapidly lost their effector function and died off as infection progressed. More encouragingly, though, we were able to recover some CD8+ T cell function by blocking immune inhibitory molecules that are induced by parasite infection. The recovered T cells killed parasites and controlled infection. These results are important as they could be exploited for the design of new therapeutic vaccine strategies aimed at inducing protective CD8+ T cells.","Leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania donovani parasite.

Many aspects of the underlying molecular mechanism still remain elusive. Among the hypotheses that have been put forward in the past few years, it has been suggested that PrP could be destabilized by the protonation of a specific residue, H187, when the protein passes through acidic cell organelles. We have modeled PrP at the atomistic level, with the neutral and protonated forms of H187. Our simulations show that the destabilization process can follow two alternative pathways that could lead to different final structures. This discovery may shed some light on one of the most puzzling aspect of prion diseases, the fact that they exhibit various strains encoded in the structure of misfolded PrP. In addition, the atomistic details provided by our model highlight a key interactions partner in the destabilization process, R136. The  residue pair is not present in non-mammalian species that do not develop prion diseases.","Prion protein (PrP) is a protein that is involved in the transmission of prion diseases to humans.

Some long-distance chromosomal interactions play an important role in gene regulation in higher eukaryotic species, such as mouse and human. In budding yeast, gene expression is traditionally thought to be regulated over short distances because the upstream regulatory sequences (URSs) are usually located close to the core promoters. However, recent chromosome conformation capture experiments have detected numerous long-distance chromosomal interactions in the yeast genome. The function of these interactions in gene regulation remains unclear. Here, we developed a new assay to screen for long-distance interactions that affect the activity of a reporter gene. We found three regulatory mechanisms that act from a distance: silencing, transcriptional interference, and 3D clustering, which alter expression level of the reporter gene as well as its cell-to-cell variability. Our results demonstrate that transcription in budding yeast, similar to transcription in higher eukaryotes, can be regulated over long distances. We anticipate our assay can be used as a general platform to screen for functional long-distance chromosomal interactions that affect gene expression.","The long-distance chromosomal interactions between cells have been shown to regulate gene expression.

Reduction by half of chromosome numbers during the first meiotic division depends on genetic exchange, resulting in the formation of crossovers. Without crossovers, pairs of homologous chromosomes frequently fail to separate, resulting in unbalanced gametes with a surplus or deficit of individual chromosomes. Along a given chromosome, crossovers form in different locations in different cells, but distribution of crossovers within each cell is controlled in two ways: first, at least one crossover is formed along each homolog pair, irrespective of size; second, a crossover in a given interval reduces the frequency of crossovers in adjacent chromosome regions. Here, we identify functions of the evolutionarily conserved protein Pch2 in suppressing additional crossovers in adjacent regions and ensuring homolog segregation under certain conditions. Pch2 further controls the assembly of chromosome axis protein Hop1 at future crossover sites. Our findings reveal that chromosome axes undergo structural changes at the same positions where crossovers occur. Thus, axis remodeling and crossover placement are linked via Pch2.","Segregation of chromosomes is dependent on the placement of crossovers and chiasmata on the chromosome axis.

In order to assist municipalities from temperate areas in Europe in effectively planning vector control programs, we modelled the effect of larviciding in public areas on populations of Aedes albopictus using mosquito collection data from 10 municipalities in Northern Italy, over two years with very different temperature conditions. We then evaluated the resulting probabilities of potential outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue and their expected final sizes, and we compared the intervention costs to the economic and health benefits due to the avoidance of clinical cases. By assessing several different intervention strategies, we found that the optimal timing should be centred on the month of July, corresponding to the period of maximal growth of the mosquito population. Municipality-wide interventions are likely to be cost-effective in small-to-medium towns (below 35,000 inhabitants) even where mosquito infestation is moderate, whereas for larger cities a neighbourhood-based intervention should be considered. The involvement of citizens to apply larvicides within private premises resulted effective but generally too costly.","Mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya and dengue are endemic in many parts of the world, and are transmitted by the Aedes albopictus mosquito. In Europe, chikungunya and dengue are transmitted by the Aedes albopictus mosquito, the same species of mosquito that causes dengue and chikungunya. In recent years, chikungunya and dengue outbreaks have been reported in several European countries. In this study, we assessed the economic benefits of routine larviciding of public catch basins in towns in temperate climates. We found that routine larviciding reduces the risk of autochthonous transmission of chikungunya and dengue by 20%-33% in a single application (dengue: 18–22 %, and chikungunya: 31–51 %) and by 43%-65% in repeated times season (dengue: 31–51 %).

Different organisms have different assortments of metabolic pathways and input/output requirements, reflecting their adaptation to specific environments, and to specific strategies for reproduction and survival. Here we ask whether, beneath the intricate wiring of these networks, it is possible to discern signatures of optimal (i.e., shortest and maximally efficient) pathway architectures. A systematic search for such optimal pathways between all possible pairs of input and output molecules in real organic chemistry is computationally intractable. However, we can implement such a search in a simple artificial chemistry, which roughly resembles a single atom (e.g., carbon) version of real biochemistry. We find that optimal pathways in our idealized chemistry display a logarithmic dependence of pathway length on input/output molecule size. They also display recurring topologies, including autocatalytic cycles reminiscent of ancient and highly conserved cores of real biochemistry. Finally, across all optimal pathways, we identify universally important metabolites and reactions, as well as a characteristic distribution of reaction utilization. Similar features can be observed in real metabolic networks, suggesting that arithmetic simplicity may lie beneath some aspects of biochemical complexity.","The evolution of metabolic networks in living cells is a fascinating enigma.

Our approach builds upon the previously developed EEMS method, which infers effective migration rates under a dense lattice. Similarly, we infer demographic parameters under a lattice and use a (Voronoi) prior to regularize parameters of the model. However, our method differs from EEMS in a few key respects. First, we use the coalescent model parameterized by migration rates and population sizes while EEMS uses a resistance model. As another key difference, our method uses haplotype data while EEMS uses the average genetic distance. A consequence of using haplotype data is that our method can separately estimate migration rates and population sizes, which in essence is done by using a recombination rate map to calibrate the decay of haplotypes over time. An additional useful feature of haplotype data is that, by varying the lengths analyzed, we can infer demography associated with different recent time periods. We call our method MAPS for estimating Migration And Population-size Surfaces. To illustrate MAPS on real data, we analyze a genome-wide SNP dataset on 2224 individuals of European ancestry.","Genetic diversity is a fundamental feature of all species, but the relationship between genetic diversity and population size is complex.

It is one of the hallmarks of metabolic disease and a consequence of ageing, but insulin resistance is also observed in otherwise healthy individuals after severe trauma/hemorrhage/sepsis, suggesting that it plays a physiological role in modulating the response to injury. Defective insulin signals are linked to impaired wound healing, yet it remains unclear how systemic changes affect locally the cells that coordinate tissue repair. In this study, we used the liver to assess how insulin resistance impacts the injury response in mice. We provide proof of concept that insulin signals are locally integrated by the fibrotic microenvironment surrounding the adult liver stem cells during chronic injury, resulting in the increased expression of epithelial repair signals. Insulin also simultaneously primes stem cells to respond to these stromal growth factors, leading to an increased participation in epithelial repair. Insulin resistance disrupts this local paracrine circuit, resulting in a blunted epithelial response to chronic injury that exacerbates tissue damage. Our model highlights a potential role for insulin in switching the hepatic injury response from a stromal repair process to an epithelial repair process. To our knowledge, our data provide a new perspective from which to reassess how insulin resistance influences fibrosis, wound healing, and tissue remodeling during injury.","Chronic liver disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and insulin resistance is one of the most common causes. In this study, we demonstrate that insulin resistance impairs local cellular crosstalk and stroma bipotent adult liver progenitor cells (stroma) and paracrine interactions promote epithelial repair tissue. We also show that insulin resistance impairs proregenerative fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) signaling, which accounts for the dramatic impairment of proregenerative fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) expression in mice deficient in insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2). We provide detailed role played by IRS2 promoting Fgf7 receptor (Fgfr2 - IIIb) expression in cell compartments, insulin / IRS2-dependent feed-forward loop capable of sustaining- epithelialization driving Fgf2 and IIIb expression.

The precise patterning of dendritic arbors is important for the proper functioning of the nervous system, and evidence indicates an involvement of sensory neurons in neuropsychiatric disease such as autism spectrum disorders. The unfolded protein response is a cellular process that ensures and maintains a functional protein-folding environment in the cell’s endoplasmic reticulum, and is compromised in a number of neurodegenerative conditions. Recently, this process has also been implicated in dendrite patterning. We discovered that the function of the unfolded protein response in dendrite patterning is evolutionarily conserved from the roundworm C. elegans to mammals. Specifically, dendrites in both worms and mammals require the function of a conserved enzyme with both kinase and ribonuclease activity, which acts as a sensor for the unfolded protein response. Importantly, we find that loss of this enzyme can be bypassed by reducing the signaling through the insulin-like growth factor receptor. Our findings reveal a new way of bypassing defects in the unfolded protein response during dendrite development.","Neurons receive excitatory sensory inputs from dendrites, branch extensively to form neuron-specific structures.

To sustain catabolism and cellular ATP demand, an appropriate balance between the reduced and oxidized forms of NAD+ must be maintained. Our genome-scale analysis of the transcription factor ArcA provides insight into how this process is transcriptionally regulated in E. coli in the absence of O2. We found that ArcA mediates a previously unrealized comprehensive transcriptional repression of genes encoding proteins associated with oxidation of non-fermentable carbon sources. Through the repression of these pathways, oxidized NAD+ is effectively preserved for fermentation pathways, facilitating energy conservation and preserving a balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of NAD+ in the absence of aerobic respiration. In addition, we found that the majority of ArcA binding sites contain additional sequence elements beyond that required for binding of an ArcA dimer, providing novel insight into how ArcA and other members of the largest class of two component system-response regulators (OmpR/PhoB family) may achieve global regulation of gene expression.","The redox balance of the cell is regulated by a number of factors, including the amount of oxygen in the blood, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the amount of electron carriers in the cell.

In the present study, we uncovered a novel genetic pathway that may lead to Rb downregulation through RNA splicing mediated by usp39, a gene involved in assembly of the spliceosome. Our forward genetic study in zebrafish suggests that loss of usp39 results in aberrant rb1 mRNA splicing, which likely causes elevated expression of its target e2f4, a key regulator known to have oncogenic activity when overexpressed. We established that e2f4 upregulation is a main factor responsible for the adenohypophyseal cell lineage hyperplasia observed in the zebrafish usp39 mutant.

We found that glucocorticoid treatment of infected mice decreased the inflammatory response within the CNS without altering the level of virus replication. In addition, abnormalities in the structure of the cerebellum, as well as abnormalities in granule neuron precursor cell proliferation were normalized in MCMV infected mice following glucocorticoid treatment.

There unfortunately is not yet a vaccine that can offer sustained, broad-based protection against ETEC. While most vaccine development effort has focused on plasmid-encoded finger-like ETEC adhesin structures known as colonization factors, additional effort is needed to identify conserved target antigens. Epidemiologic studies suggest that immune responses to uncharacterized, chromosomally encoded antigens could contribute to protection resulting from repeated infections. Earlier studies of immune responses to ETEC infection had identified a class of surface-expressed molecules known as autotransporters (AT). Therefore, available ETEC genome sequences were examined to identify conserved ETEC autotransporters not shared by the commensal E. coli HS strain, followed by studies of the immune response to these antigens, and tests of their utility as vaccine components.

In this retrospective review of the epidemiology and outcomes of cases in Oman from 1995 to 2017, we identified 4 sporadic cases in 1995 and 1996, then none until 2011, followed by a steady increase until 2017. The mortality rate of 32 of 88 cases (36.4%) is high in comparison to studies from other countries and this could be explained by under-diagnoses of milder cases in the Sultanate. Transmission is commonly associated with animal husbandry and butchering and 88% cases were infected by contact with animals, whereas transmission by tick bite is more commonly recorded in some countries. A proportion of cases (23.8%) were clustered around the Eid-Al-Ahda festival which has, from 2011–2017, occurred in the summer months, which have a higher risk of transmission. This additional risk has been noted and preventive measures have been introduced to reduce the risk of transmission to animal handlers and butchers.",Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an infectious disease caused by the Crimean-Congo virus. CCHF has been reported in Oman since 1995 and has been associated with a high mortality rate.

Although the balance is often perturbed by environmental changes, mutations, and noise in biochemical reactions, cellular systems can maintain their function despite these perturbations. This property of cells, called robustness, is now considered to be a design principle of biological systems and has become a central theme for systems biology. We previously developed an experimental method designated “genetic tug-of-war,” in which we assessed the robustness of cellular systems upon overexpression of certain genes, especially that of the budding yeast cell cycle. Although the yeast cell cycle can be maintained despite significant overexpression of most genes within the system, the cell cycle halts upon just two-fold overexpression of M phase phosphatase CDC14. In this study, we experimentally showed that this fragility is caused by dosage imbalance between CDC14 and NET1. Interestingly, fragility of regulation of separase gene ESP1, potentially caused by dosage imbalance, was masked by regulation of other factors such as CDH1 and CLB2. We thus propose that dosage imbalance causes fragility in biological systems.","Cells maintain functions despite fluctuations in intracellular parameters, protein activities gene expression levels, and the property of imbalance cells called robustness.

Extensive studies have revealed that the dysregulation of STAT6 is linked to the pathological features of virus-associated cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of STAT6 regulation by tumor viruses is still unknown. Here, we report that the degradation of STAT6 is induced and required for the lytic activation of human herpesviruses including oncogenic γ-herpesviruses (KSHV and EBV) and α/β-herpesviruses (HSV1 and HCMV). Importantly, this effect is highly dependent on the expression of viral lytic antigens (i.e., RTA in KSHV). This study reveals the central role of STAT6 in controlling the switch from latency to lytic replication of herpesviruses.","The human herpesvirus (HSV) is the most common virus in the world, and it has been shown to be involved in the development of a wide range of human diseases, including cancer. However, the role of herpesvirus lytic replication remains elusive. In the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) model, we show that the master regulator of lytic replication, RTA, interacts with STAT6 to promote 48 (K48) and K63-linked ubiquitylation of the STAT6 degradationsome lysosome systems. In addition, we show that degradation of STAT6 dramatically associated increased ubiquitylated form of the tripartite motif family like 2 ( TRIML2) with prolonged cell survival virion production and, commonly observed, lytic activation of Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and cytomegalovirus.

In 2012 the observed dengue seroprevalence was 93% among individuals tested during post-monsoon with a seroconversion rate between pre- and post-monsoon periods of 57.7%. This finding suggests that dengue virus (DENV) circulated in the city during the observation period. Past exposure to dengue virus was highly associated with age, possession of indoor potted plants, types of mosquito control measures used, and human movement and attendance in mass gatherings, while the extent of dengue seroprevalence were not associated with the socioeconomic status of the study participants. Our findings suggest that household utilities and water management or storage practices and recognition and elimination of mosquito development sites and participation in mass gatherings are important factors that affect exposure to dengue. Intervention strategies should therefore target these factors for effective prevention and control of dengue infection.","Dengue virus (V) activity was reported in Dhaka, Bangladesh, early in the 1960s as the greatest burden dengue fever and hemorrhagic dengue fever cases observed in the early 1960s.

C. difficile transmission is mediated by contamination of gut by spores. Understanding how this complex developmental process is regulated is fundamental to decipher the C. difficile transmission and pathogenesis. A less tight connection between the forespore and mother cell lines of gene expression is observed in C. difficile compared to Bacillus subtilis especially at the level of the late sigma factor, σK. In C. difficile, the sigK gene is interrupted in most of the strains by a prophage-like intervening sequence, skinCd, which is excised during sporulation. Contrary to B. subtilis, CD1231 encoding the large serine recombinase required for skinCd excision, is constitutively expressed and a recombination directionality factor, whose synthesis is detected only in the mother cell, restricts skinCd excision to this terminal cell. These two proteins are necessary and sufficient to trigger skinCd excision promoting the timely appearance of σK, which in turn switches-on late sporulation events. While several strains of C. difficile lack a skin element, we show that deletion of skinCd results in premature σK activity and in spores with altered surface layers, a property that might be important for host colonization.","Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea in the United States.

Although the numbers of infected humans have decreased continuously during the last decades, emerging resistance and adverse side effects against commonly used drugs require an urgent need for the identification of novel drug targets and the development of new drugs. Using an unbiased genome-wide screen to search for genes involved in the mode of action of trypanocidal compounds, we identified a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, TbMCP14, as prime candidate to mediate the action of a group of anti-parasitic choline analogs against T. brucei. Ablation of TbMCP14 expression by RNA interference or gene deletion decreases the susceptibility of parasites towards the compounds while over-expression of the carrier shows the opposite effect. In addition, down-regulation of TbMCP14 protects mitochondria from drug-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces proline-dependent ATP production. Together, the results demonstrate that TbMCP14 is involved in energy production in T. brucei, possibly by acting as a mitochondrial proline carrier, and reveal TbMCP14 as candidate protein for drug action or targeting.","Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes severe morbidity and mortality in Africa.

Can a “ligand-receptor” model apply to all the GPCRs? Our study shows that it probably cannot.

Protein structure analysis and experiment data also suggest that placental mammalian BRS3, including human BRS3, lost connection with its original ligands during placental mammalian evolution. Therefore, we propose a new point of view that a considerable number of orphan GPCRs do not have endogenous ligands and might represent a new group of GPCRs that are genuinely orphan GPCRs and will never be deorphanized by discovery of a natural ligand.

Our work shows that intracellular T. gondii tachyzoites are able to salvage farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and/or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from the host, and the parasite is able to grow even when its endogenous production is shut down. However, when extracellular, the parasite depends entirely on its own production of isoprenoids. We propose to use a combination of inhibitors that would hit both the host and the parasite pathways as a novel therapeutic approach against Toxoplasma gondii that could also work against other Apicomplexan parasites.","Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most important intracellular pathogens in the world. The intracellular parasite synthesizes isoprenoids, a group of lipidic compounds that are essential for cellular processes including signaling, metabolism, energy precursors, protein translation, and protein translation. Toxoplasma gondii synthesizes farnesyl diphosphate/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (TgFPPS), a bifunctional farnesyl diphosphate/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (FPP/G) that is essential for the synthesis of isoprenoid precursors. In this study, we show that TgFPPS is lost in T. gondii mutants, suggesting that the intracellular parasite salvages FPP and/or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (G) from the host cell. We propose a double-hit strategy combining inhibitors of the host pathways with a novel therapeutic approach for Apicomplexan parasites.",11.668899224806204

Our comparative genome analyses have highlighted the role of pathoadaptive changes in virulence associated genes, such as those encoding for effectors, in shaping the underlying differences in virulence spectra among the three species, and also revealed that changes in the size of gene families associated with nutrient acquisition and assimilation are more respectful of the species virulence profiles rather than their evolutionary relationships. Thus, we posit that next to species-specific evolutionary adaptations in virulence-associated genes, the increase in virulence of P. eumusae and P. fijiensis has been driven by convergent evolution in metabolic pathways that likely facilitate a higher efficiency of nutrient acquisition, uptake, and utilization.","Sigatoka disease, caused by closely-related Dothideomycete fungi Pseudocercospora musae (yellow sigatoka), Pseudocercospora eumusae ( eumusae leaf spot) and Pseudocercospora fijiensis (black sigatoka), is currently devastating the banana industry worldwide.

However, the mechanisms that result in these clinical outcomes after infection are poorly understood. In this study, we applied a data-driven approach to obtain insights into the immunological processes linked to the progression of the disease or to protective mechanisms. For this purpose, we evaluated the patterns of expression for genes that code proteins from the entire human genome in the peripheral blood from patients with visceral leishmaniasis, from individuals who remained asymptomatic after infections with L. infantum, from patients who were recovering from disease after treatment and from uninfected individuals. By employing computational analysis to evaluate the blood transcriptional activity of each group, we identified transcriptional signatures that correlate with previous findings obtained through different analytical methods. Moreover, our analyses uncovered hitherto unidentified molecular pathways and gene networks associated with the transcriptional profiles of individuals recovering from disease or that did not develop symptoms after infection.

This conflict of interest among cooperating individuals can lead to the evolution of complex social strategies that depend on the identity (e.g. genotype or strategy) of the individuals with whom you interact. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum provides a compelling model for studying such “partner specific” conflict and cooperation. Upon starvation, free-living amoebae aggregate and form a fruiting body composed of dead stalk cells and hardy spores. Different genotypes will aggregate to produce chimeric fruiting bodies, resulting in potential social conflict over who will contribute to the reproductive sporehead and who will “sacrifice” themselves to produce the dead stalk. The outcomes of competitive interactions in chimera appear complex, with social success being strongly partner specific. Here we propose a simple mechanism to explain social strategies in D. discoideum, based on the production of and response to stalk-inducing factors, the social signals that determine whether cells become stalk or spore. Indeed, measurements of signal production and response can predict social behavior of different strains, thus demonstrating a novel and elegantly simple underlying mechanistic basis for natural variation in complex facultative social strategies. This suggests that simple social rules can be sufficient to generate a diverse array of behavioral outcomes that appear complex and unpredictable when those rules are unknown.","The evolution of cooperative social behavior is a complex phenomenon that results in complex, opponent-specific, social strategies and counterstrategies.

Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that mRNAs encoding SMPs (mSMPs) are also enriched on the ER, yet how they target this organelle is less clear. The signal recognition particle (SRP), which recognizes N-terminal hydrophobic signals of nascent polypeptides and targets them to an ER-localized receptor, was proposed to mediate the co-translational ER targeting of mRNA. However, more recent studies show that SRP inactivation, as well as the inhibition of translation, do not prevent targeting. Thus, how mSMPs reach the ER and whether the process is translation-independent remain open. Here we identify a cis-acting sequence element in mSMPs that appears to facilitate mRNA stability and localization to the ER and, more importantly, enhances protein secretion. This motif, entitled “SECReTE” (secretion-enhancing cis regulatory targeting element) is enriched in nearly all mSMPs in eukaryotes and its addition or removal from mRNAs results in either enhanced or reduced protein secretion, respectively. Thus, SECReTE is a RNA sequence motif that regulates protein translation and secretion.","The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membrane-bound protein that is required for the translation of secreted and membrane-bound proteins.

For instance, we wondered whether or not protein coding regions carried a greater information potential than non-coding regions, if there is a link between genome size and GC content, whether GC content is different in coding and non-coding regions, and possible associations between DNA composition and environment. Our results indicated that genomic nucleotide frequencies are a determinant of many DNA compositional properties, but also that other influences are at work.

The egg is the least known life stage and understanding it can contribute with novel strategies for mosquito control. Mosquitoes lay eggs in water collections, some of which are temporary. At early embryogenesis eggs are prone to lose water, leading to dehydration and death. During embryogenesis the serosal cuticle is produced, it wraps the embryo and contributes to the egg protection, allowing it to survive outside the water. Curiously, this resistance varies among mosquitoes: Aedes, Anopheles and Culex eggs can survive outside the water for long, intermediate and short periods, respectively. Here, we show that these differences are related to the degree of eggshell melanization (melanin is a dark pigment): darker eggs resists more against water loss. We confirmed that melanin increases survival outside the water employing a mosquito mutant that does not melanize properly. The protection conferred by melanin is dependent on the formation of the serosal cuticle.

However, irregular somites are still formed, suggesting that the clock is not required for somite formation itself but rather endows it with developmental reproducibility. Thus, the following questions arose: How do irregular somites emerge in a clock-independent manner? How is the irregularity reduced in the presence of the clock? To address these questions, we developed a computational model of somitogenesis. We then clarified that the intrinsic noise induces spontaneous formation of irregular-sized somites in the absence of the clock, and that the clock plays an important role in suppressing the noise effect for reproducible somite formation.","Somites are the most common cell type in vertebrates, and they are the most abundant cell type in mammals. In vertebrates, somites are formed by a process called somitogenesis, which involves a bistable ERK activity regulated by the FGF gradient, cell-cell communication, and segmentation clock. In this study, we developed a computational model of ERK-mediated somitogenesis, bistable ERK activity regulated by the FGF gradient, cell-cell communication, and segmentation clock, subject to intrinsic noise. We show that the somite regularity is robustly maintained in the absence of the segmentation clock. We also show that the somite irregularity observed in clock-deficient embryos is due to the irregular timing of ERK activity, resulting in somite size variation. We propose a novel role for segmentation clock in somite irregularity observed in clock-deficient embryos.",13.458904109589039

Proteins such as hemoglobin or chaperonin GroEL are oligomers formed by 2 and 14 subunits, respectively, whereas virus capsids are multimers composed of hundreds of monomers. In these cases, the architecture of the interface between the subunits and the overall assembly geometry are essential in determining the functional motions that these sophisticated structures are able to perform under physiological conditions. Here we present results from our computational study of the large-amplitude motions of dimeric and hexameric proteins that belong to the Amino Acid Kinase family. Our study reveals that the monomers in these oligomeric proteins are arranged in such a way that the oligomer inherits the intrinsic dynamic features of its components. The packing geometry additionally confers the ability to perform highly cooperative conformational changes that involve all monomers and enable the biological activity of the multimer. The study highlights the significance of the quaternary design in favoring the oligomer dynamics that enables ligand-binding and allosteric regulation functions.","Oligomerization is the process by which individual amino acid residues of a protein are packed together into a single subunit. Oligomerization has been shown to be an important determinant of the thermodynamic stability of allosteric regulation of oligomers. However, the role of interfacial interactions in oligomerization is not well understood. In this study, we focus on the role of interfacial interactions in the overall contact topology and dynamic features acquired in oligomeric state. We show that the lowest-frequency global modes of individual amino acid residues of dimeric hexameric forms of enzymes belonging to the acid kinase family of dimeric hexameric forms are accessible to the overall architecture. Notably, the lowest-frequency global modes of individual amino acid residues of dimeric hexameric forms of enzymes belonging to the acid kinase family of dimeric hexameric forms are conserved large extent in oligomerization, suggesting that oligomer takes advantage of intrinsic dynamics of individual amino acid residues.

Over 99% of these deaths occur in developing countries, predominantly in Asia and in Africa where rabies is endemic in domestic dogs. Despite the global health burden due to rabies, little is known about the patterns of the spread of dog rabies in these endemic regions. We used recently developed Bayesian analytical methods to unravel the dynamics and determinants of the spatial diffusion of dog rabies viruses in North Africa based on viral genetic data. Our analysis reveals a combination of restricted spread across administrative borders, the occasional long-distance movement of rabies viruses, and a strong fit between spatial spread of the virus and road distances between localities. Together, these data indicate that by transporting dogs, humans have played a key role in the dispersal of a major animal pathogen. Our studies therefore provide essential new information on the transmission dynamics of rabies in Africa, and in doing so will greatly assist in future intervention strategies.",Understanding the role of humans in the dispersal of animal pathogens is essential to control the spread of these pathogens. We have developed a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to unravel dynamics determinants of the spread of dog rabies virus (RABV) in North Africa.

It is a serious tropical disease that in some countries has spread in association with several factors such as human migration, precarious urbanization and vector adaptation to urban areas. In Brazil, although control measures such as the elimination of infected dogs, the application of residual insecticide and environmental management have been applied by the health authorities, however, they have not resulted in any significant reduction in VL incidence. The knowledge of bionomic parameters of vector populations is critical for the understanding of the transmission dynamic of VL and to evaluate prevention and control measures. Therefore, in the present study we applied the mark-release-recapture (MRR) method to evaluate under field conditions some basic bionomic parameters of a population of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex. Our findings demonstrate a high survival rate of this vector and a low population dispersal. These results suggest that measures applied to dog populations to prevent sand fly bites could contribute to the reduction of the surviving vector population and indirectly to the reduction of the host biting rate. Additionally, the low dispersal suggests that environmental management could contribute to the reduction of vector density.

The mechanisms underlying the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to specifically distinguish pathogens from commensal bacteria are only partially understood. Commensal and enteropathogenic E. coli strains are highly similar and both reside in the gut lumen. However, only the pathogen is equipped with a type III protein secretion system, which is employed to inject effector proteins into the host cells.

It is caused by Schistosoma flatworms that live in the bloodstream. Current treatment relies on one drug, and no effective vaccine has yet been developed. Proteolytic enzymes (proteases) help the parasite survive in the mammalian host, allowing the schistosome to invade, feed, grow, reproduce and, manipulate the immune system. Thus, proteases are considered potential drug and vaccine targets. We previously described, and herein, investigate at the protein level, SmSP2, the major serine protease produced by the blood-dwelling stages of S. mansoni. We show that SmSP2 is secreted by the parasite and effectively processes host blood bioactive peptides and proteins that are involved in fibrinolysis and regulation of vascular tone.

Parasite sexual stage development was not affected and development continued normally within the mosquito. However, sporozoites lacking the inhibitor show a strong phenotype; they are completely blocked in motility and thus cannot transmigrate or invade cells. Complementation of knockout parasites by exogenous expression of the inhibitor completely restored parasite virulence.","Plasmodium berghei proteases (PbICP) are a family of proteases that are essential for the motility of the parasite. In this study, we generated a stage-specific knockout of PbICP in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites. We found that PbICP-negative sporozoites were unable to invade hepatocytes, despite the presence of residual PbICP protein. In contrast, PbICP-positive sporozoites were able to invade hepatocytes, despite the presence of residual PbICP protein. We also found that PbICP-negative sporozoites were able to infect mosquitoes, despite the presence of residual PbICP protein. We conclude that PbICP-negative sporozoites are essential for the motility of the parasite.",9.465642201834864

Replacement of core histones with histone variants has recently emerged as a key mechanism for regulating chromatin states. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z is of particular interest because it is essential for embryonic development and for proper execution of developmental gene expression programs during cellular specification. ESCs provide a good model for investigating the function of H2A.Z during lineage commitment because these cells can generate an unlimited number of equivalent descendants while maintaining the capacity to differentiate into any cell type in the organism. Divergent regions in H2A.Z are likely key for functional specialization, but we know little about how these differences contribute to chromatin regulation. Here, we show that the unique H2A.Z acidic patch domain is necessary for regulation of lineage commitment during ESC differentiation by linking transcription to chromatin dynamics. Our work provides a critical foundation for elucidating how H2A.Z incorporation is key to cell fate determination. These findings are particularly important given that H2A.Z has been implicated in many diseased conditions, including cancer.","The histone H2A variant H2A.Z is essential for embryonic development and proper control of developmental gene expression programs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

In the current study, we applied a novel method for the reconstruction of cell lineage trees from microsatellite mutations accumulated during mouse life. We focused on the intestinal epithelium, since its stem cells were intensively studied by various tracing methods that clarified many aspects of their dynamics. We first showed the reliability of our method by confirming three previously established facts: the existence of “monoclonal conversion,” the absence of an immortal strand mechanism in colon stem cells, and the separation of the colon into small domains each with a common ancestor. We also answered a few open questions, showing that the colon's lineage is separated from other lineages such as the hematopoietic and pancreatic lineages. Overall, our work presents a new approach for the study of stem cell dynamics and can similarly be used for studying stem cell dynamics in other systems.","Stem cells are the most abundant cells in the human body. However, the dynamics of stem cells are not well understood. In this study, we developed a new method to study stem cells in the mouse colon using stem cell markers.

However, ART is currently a lifelong commitment because HIV persists during treatment despite being suppressed below detection. If therapy is stopped, the HIV reappears. A concerted effort is ongoing to develop new eradication therapies to prevent virus rebound, but there are challenges to be overcome. Our work is a major step forward in this process. We measured persistent HIV throughout the body during ART using bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) humanized mice, a model validated to study HIV persistence. HIV infected BLT mice were treated with tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir. Despite documented tissue penetration by these drugs, we found that HIV expression persists in cells isolated from all the tissues analyzed (bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, liver, lung, intestines and peripheral blood cells). We therefore complemented ART with an immunotoxin that specifically kills HIV expressing cells while leaving other cells untouched. Our results demonstrate a dramatic reduction in persistent HIV throughout the body resulting from the killing of virus producing cells. Thus, our study provides new insights into the locations of HIV persistence during ART and a demonstration that persistent HIV can be successfully targeted inside the body.","Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to reduce HIV levels in the blood, but little is known about the effects of ART outside the peripheral blood.

In order to eliminate rabies, annual vaccination of at least 70% of the dog population is recommended. In SSA most rabies vaccination programmes use static point (SP) vaccination approaches. Despite being logistically and economically more feasible than door-to-door approaches, SP vaccination campaigns often result in low vaccination coverage. Here we investigated the reasons why attendance at SPs offering free rabies vaccinations for dogs is suboptimal in SSA. We analysed data from a citywide vaccination campaign in Blantyre city, Malawi in combination with household related data. Our results found that the distance from home to SP influences attendance at SPs. We also found a clear need for provision of timely and accurate information about upcoming campaigns, including information on the importance of puppies being vaccinated as well as ways to improve dog handling.

The parasites are acquired when tsetse flies feed on an infected host, undergo multiplication in the fly gut and migrate to the salivary glands (SG). The cycle resumes once this infected fly transmits the parasites in conjunction with saliva to another host when feeding. We compared gene expression changes between parasitized and uninfected tsetse SG. We also assessed changes in parasite gene expression in the tsetse SG in relation to those present within vertebrate blood. We found that parasite infections increase expression of host proteins associated with stress and cell division, indicative of extensive cellular damage in SG. We also found that parasite infections reduce expression of the most highly expressed SG-specific secreted proteins, suggesting modification of saliva composition. The parasite transcriptome reveals changes in specific cell surface proteins and in metabolism related to glucose-amino acid utilization in the different host environments.

How often trypanosomes exchange genetic material (they can mate in the tsetse fly) is debated, but will impact upon the spread of genes (e.g. that which confers human infectivity) through a population. We studied T. b. rhodesiense populations from different geographic locations (Malawi and two locations in Uganda), and over time (Uganda), to see if the populations are stable over time and space, using a panel of variable genetic markers enabling assessment of diversity. Our results suggest that there is significant difference in diversity between locations; those in Uganda are very closely related, increasingly so over time, whereas the Malawi population is very genetically diverse, consistent with the trypanosomes mating.

The neurons carry information as spikes that are transmitted to other neurons via connections with different strengths and propagation delays. Experimentally observed learning rules can modify the strengths of connections between neurons based on the timing of their spikes. The learning that occurs in neuronal networks due to these rules is thought to be vital to creating the structures necessary for different cognitive processes as well as for memory. The spiking rate of populations of neurons has been observed to oscillate at particular frequencies in various brain regions, and there is evidence that these oscillations play a role in cognition. Here, we use analytical and numerical methods to investigate the changes to the network structure caused by a specific learning rule during oscillatory neural activity. We find the conditions under which connections with propagation delays that resonate with the oscillations are strengthened relative to the other connections. We demonstrate that networks learn to oscillate more strongly to oscillations at the frequency they were presented with during learning.

This leishmania species can be delivered by pool blood feeding zoo-anthropophilic phlebotomine flies to several mammals, the dog population being recognized as the main reservoir. Transmission from infected dogs to humans is through the bite of female phlebotomine sand flies. The disease is endemic in several countries and Brazil has a high prevalence of cases with over 3000 ZVL cases reported per year. The main, inefficient and highly controversial, control measure in Brazil has been culling sero-positive dogs. The community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs could be an alternative to control L. infantum transmission from phlebotomine flies to humans. The rationale is that phlebotomine flies which sampled their blood meals from dogs treated with systemic insecticides would die reducing the risk of L. infantum transmission. To reduce the number of ZVL cases, a large proportion of dogs in the community should be treated and the systemic insecticide used should be effective in killing phlebotomine flies acting as vectors of L. infantum parasites for a significant amount of time. We used a mathematical model mimicking L. infantum transmission to show that this novel vector control strategy could be effective. We identified the combination of different key parameters (e.g. insecticide efficacy, duration and proportion of dogs treated) that could lead to a significant reduction of the risk of L. infantum infection in humans.","Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted to humans by blood-feeding phlebotomine flies.

Signaling pathway components involved apical organelle discharge serve novel targets drug development inhibition microneme rhoptry secretion block invasion limit blood - stage parasite growth .","Malaria remains a major public health problem in many parts of the tropical world. All the clinical symptoms of malaria are attributed to the blood stage of the parasite life cycle during which Plasmodium merozoites invade and multiply within host erythrocytes. Invasion by Plasmodium merozoites is a complex process that requires multiple molecular interactions between the invading parasite and target erythrocyte. Parasite proteins that mediate such interactions are localized in membrane bound internal organelles at the apical end of merozoites called micronemes and rhoptries. The timely secretion of microneme and rhoptry proteins to the merozoite surface to allow receptor binding is a crucial step in the invasion process. In this study, we demonstrate that exposure of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites to low potassium ion concentrations as found in blood plasma provides the natural signal that triggers a rise in intracellular calcium, which in turn triggers secretion of microneme proteins to the merozoite surface. Subsequently, binding of released microneme proteins with erythrocyte receptors provides the signal for release of rhoptry proteins. These studies open the path for analysis of signal transduction pathways involved in apical organelle secretion. A clear understanding of these pathways will enable development of inhibitors that block secretion of key parasite proteins required for receptor-binding. Such inhibitors will block erythrocyte invasion and inhibit parasite growth, providing promising leads for development of novel drugs against malaria.","erythrocyte invasion is a critical step in the development of the blood-stage parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite invades the erythrocytes of its host, Plasmodium merozoites, by binding to the erythrocyte receptor, which is located in the micronemes rhoptries of the apical organelle. The micronemes rhoptries are located on the surface of the apical organelle and are responsible for the secretion of microneme rhoptry proteins. Here, we show that the release of microneme rhoptry proteins from the apical organelle is regulated by the intracellular calcium levels of the apical organelle. We show that the release of microneme rhoptry proteins from the apical organelle is regulated by the intracellular calcium levels of the apical organelle. We also show that the release of microneme rhoptry proteins from the apical organelle is regulated by the intracellular calcium levels of the apical organelle.

As a result, insufficient blood supply and high fluid pressure begin to appear inside the tumor which leads to a reduced delivery of drugs within the tumor, especially in tumor center. A treatment strategy that utilizes anti-vascular drugs is observed to revert these alterations in tumor vessels, making them more normal. This approach is suggested to improve drug delivery by enhancing physical transport of drugs. In this paper, we build a mathematical model to simulate tumor and vessel growth as well as fluid pressure inside the tumor. This framework enables us to simulate drug treatment scenarios on tumors. We use this model to find whether the delivery of the chemotherapy drugs is enhanced by application of anti-vascular drugs by making vessels more normal. Our simulations show that anti-vascular drug not only enhances the amount of drugs that is released into tumor tissue, but also enhances drug distribution enabling drug release in the central regions of tumor.","The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the progression of cancer.

While sentinel functions of DCs are essential for establishment of an antiviral state, HIV-1 can subvert DC function for its dissemination. One of the mechanisms by which DCs can mediate virus spread is via the trans infection pathway whereby DCs capture HIV-1 particles and retain them in an infectious state without getting infected, and pass these infectious particles to CD4+ T cells upon initiation of cellular contacts. In this report, we demonstrate that expression of Siglec-1or CD169, on DC surface is responsible for capture of HIV-1 particles by binding the ganglioside, GM3, present in the virion lipid bilayer. This interaction between CD169 and GM3 targets captured virus particles to non-degradative compartments and resulted in retention of virus particle infectivity within DCs. Upon initiation of T cell contacts with virus-laden DCs, HIV-1 particles were trafficked to the DC – T synaptic junctions and transferred to T cells for establishment of productive infection. These studies define a novel host-encoded receptor – ligand interaction that drives HIV-1 dissemination and can be used for development of novel anti-viral therapeutics.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the most common human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the world. The virus is transmitted to the host through the interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and dendritic cells derived from glycosphingolipids (GSLs).

Cartilage-producing cells (chondrocytes) first secrete a cartilage matrix around themselves that is rich in sugar-coated proteins called proteoglycans (PGs). Chondrocytes then undergo a maturation process during which they express Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a secreted protein that stimulates bone formation in surrounding cells. Here, we find that PGs in cartilage matrix regulate the timing of chondrocyte maturation, showing that interactions between cells and an environment that they themselves create are crucial for proper skeletal development. Our conclusions are based upon analyses of zebrafish with mutations in two different PG synthesis genes that produce identical skeletal defects. We argue that, as a consequence of deficient cartilage PG production, mutant chondrocytes accelerate the timing of ihh expression, which we show causes early and increased bone production in the surrounding cells.","Chondrocytes embed proteoglycan (PG)-rich matrix in the perichondrium, undergo developmental transition, and express ihh to induce bone overlying tissue, perichondrium.

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can infect many avian and mammalian hosts, but while few IAV subtypes circulate in human populations, subtype diversity is extensive in wild bird populations. How do these subtypes coexist in wild avian populations and do they compete within these natural host populations? Here we experimentally challenged mallard ducks with different IAVs to study how an initial infection with H3N8 determines the outcome of later infections (duration of infection and virus load) and antibody responses. There was complete protection to re-infection with the same H3N8 virus based on virus isolation. In addition, there was partial protection induced by H3N8 pre-challenge to other subtypes and development of heterosubtypic immunity indicated by significantly shorter infections and reduction in viral load compared to controls. This indicates that subtype dynamics in the host population are not independent. Amongst H3N8 pre-challenged groups, the highest protection was conferred to the H4N5 subtype which was most genetically related to H3N8. The H4N5 challenge also induced an increase in H3 antibody levels in that challenge group and evidence for original antigenic sin or antigenic seniority. Thus, previous infections with IAV can influence the outcome of subsequent challenge with different IAV subtypes. These results not only have relevance to understanding naturally occurring subtype diversity in wild avian populations but also in understanding potential outcomes associated with introduction of novel viruses such as highly pathogenic IAV H5 viruses in wild bird populations.","Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major public health threat to humans and animals worldwide.

Most bacteria contain, besides a single chromosome, autonomously replicating units called plasmids. Many plasmids carry genes enabling them to be transferred into plasmid-free bacteria. This process, called conjugation, contributes significantly to HGT. Many plasmids also contain antibiotic resistance genes. Therefore, plasmid conjugation plays a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the regulation of conjugation genes is essential for designing strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. We have studied the regulation of the native plasmid pLS20 from Bacillus subtilis. Besides being a soil bacterium, B. subtilis is a gut commensal in animals and humans. Here we unraveled the mechanisms controlling conjugation and found that pLS20 conjugation genes become activated when plasmid-free recipient cells are present. We have identified the repressor protein that keeps conjugation in an ‘OFF’ state, and an anti-repressor that activates conjugation. The activity of the anti-repressor is inhibited by a pLS20-encoded peptide that is secreted from the cell and can be absorbed by cells, after a secondary processing step. Ultimately, it is the signaling-peptide that dictates when conjugation genes become activated.","Gram-positive bacteria are known to be highly resistant to antibiotics.

To address that question, we conducted whole genome microarray based gene expression studies between susceptible and refractory strains of A. aegypti to identify gene expression patterns following challenge with dengue virus. Our analysis of the early infection periods reveals that a large number of genes are involved in a highly coordinated manner either to host or defend against the virus. Genes responding to dengue infection were clustered in seven expression modules. Genes associated with susceptibility to infection were largely clustered in one expression module, while those associated with refractoriness were distributed in four distinct modules. A common core set of genes expressed in both susceptible and refractory individuals were clustered in two expression modules. We identified genes and specific pathways that potentially regulate compatible or non-compatible interactions between dengue virus and the mosquito, most notably energy metabolism and DNA replication in the susceptible response in contrast to cell growth and death in the refractory response.",Dengue virus (DNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes dengue fever in humans and is important in the subtropics of the tropics worldwide.

We found that genes involved in metabolism and DNA replication were strongly biased in response to the virus infection in the susceptible strain. We also found that genes involved in cell growth and death were strongly biased in response to the virus infection in the refractory strain.

In several of the endemic areas, it co-exists with onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF). Because of the benefit individuals suffering from onchocerciasis could have by taking ivermectin where the disease is severe, despite the risk of developing serious side-effects due to being co-infected with L. loa, mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin for the control of onchocerciasis has been ongoing in areas where the two diseases overlap. Ivermectin is also effective against loiasis. It is, therefore, hypothesized that several years of ivermectin MDA against onchocerciasis in those areas may have impacted on parasitological indicators for loiasis. In particular, we assess the impact of annual community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) on loiasis with specific reference to the relationship between adherence to treatment and the risk of developing severe (nervous system) complications following ivermectin treatment.

This feature helps to avoid conflicts between head-on replication and transcription. The precise consequences of the conflict and how it affects genome organization remain to be understood. We previously found that reversing the transcription bias slows replication in the Bacillus subtilis genome. Here we engineered new inversions to avoid changes in other aspects of genome organization. We found that the reversed transcription bias is sufficient to decrease replication speed, and it results in lowered fitness of the inversion strains and a competitive disadvantage relative to wild-type cells in minimal medium. Further, by analyzing genomic copy-number snapshots to obtain replication speed as a function of genome position, we found that inversion of the strongly-transcribed rRNA genes obstructs replication during growth in rich medium. This confers a strong growth disadvantage to cells in rich medium, turns on DNA damage responses, and leads to cell death in a subpopulation of cells, while the surviving cells are more sensitive to genotoxic agents. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that evolution has favored co-orientation of transcription with replication, mainly to avoid these effects.","In bacteria, the genome-wide bias co-orientation replication transcription is essential and/or highly-expressed genes enriched co-directionally. Previously, we found that reversing the bias contributes to evolutionary pressure selecting transcription-replicating co-bias. In this study, we show that the genome-wide bias co-orientation replication transcription is essential and/or highly-expressed genes enriched co-directionally. Our results strongly suggest that genome integrity drives evolution co-orientation replication transcription, a conserved feature of genome organization.",13.152027027027028

Humans are accidental hosts, and acquire the disease primarily from contact with water sources that have been contaminated with urine from infected animals. Rats are asymptomatic carriers of infection and are critical for disease transmission to humans, particularly in urban slum environments. In this study, investigation of Leptospira directly isolated from the urine of infected rats showed acetylation or tri-methylation of the highly abundant leptospiral lipoprotein, LipL32. In comparison, Leptospira grown in culture did not result in any LipL32 lysine modifications. A synthetic peptide derived from LipL32 that incorporated a tri-methylated lysine modification exhibited less reactivity with serum from leptospirosis patients compared to an unmodified version of the peptide, suggesting LipL32 modifications may alter protein recognition by the immune response. This study reports, for the first time, modification of a Leptospira protein during infection, and suggests these modifications may have a functional consequence that contributes to bacterial persistence during infection.","Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira interrogans.

We address this through mouse models of sequential infection with MCMV and an Ad-Hu5 vaccine vector.

However, critical interactions between this pathway and other growth regulatory mechanisms – for example, the physiological mechanisms involved in nutrition-dependent expression of these traits – are less well understood. In this study, we provide evidence of a developmental link between nutrition-sensitivity and sexual differentiation in the giant mandibles of the sexually dimorphic stag beetle, Cyclommatus metallifer. We examined the regulation and function of a key sex determination gene in animals, doublesex (dsx), and its interaction with juvenile hormone (JH), an important insect hormone known to regulate insect polyphenisms including the regulation of the disproportionate growth of male stag beetle mandibles. We found that Cmdsx changes mandibular responsiveness to JH in a sex-specific pattern.

Here, we analyze the regulatory network that drives terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the cells of the vertebrate central nervous system that form myelin and thereby guarantee rapid saltatory conduction. We show that the transcription factor Myrf is directly activated by the transcription factor Sox10, and map a Sox10-responsive enhancer to an evolutionarily conserved element in intron 1 of the Myrf gene. We then go on to show that once induced, Myrf physically interacts and functionally cooperates with its inducer Sox10 to activate myelin genes arguing that the two jointly drive terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes. With this study we define an essential module in the myelin-specific regulatory network in the central nervous system. By comparing this module with the corresponding module in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system which consists of Sox10 and the Krox20 transcription factor we furthermore conclude that myelination in the two compartments of the vertebrate nervous system is regulated by similarly organized, but differentially implemented regulatory networks.","Myelin is an essential component of rapid saltatory conduction in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system.

Zinc acts as a direct antimicrobial against the pathogen, mobilized by phagocytic cells as a component of the innate immune response. Although immune activation and infiltration of phagocytic cells is unaffected by host zinc status, the lack of antimicrobial zinc compromises bacterial control in zinc deficient hosts.

With an increasing number of Dengue Hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and                    fatal cases, the availability of new approaches useful for cases confirmation                    plays an important role for the disease surveillance. The diagnosis of fatal                    cases in frozen and fixed tissues from autopsies can be determined by techniques                    such as viral RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, viral proteins detection by                    immunohistochemistry and NS3 specific immunostaining.

Certain CMVs and other large DNA viruses encode homologs of the cell-surface molecule CD48, a ligand of the 2B4 receptor involved in regulating the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Here, we have investigated for the first time the immunomodulatory potential of one of these viral molecules. We show that A43, a CD48 homolog encoded by owl monkey CMV, is a soluble molecule that exhibits exceptional binding kinetics for 2B4, and is furthermore capable of blocking the interaction with its counter-receptor CD48. Moreover, we reveal how this viral protein interferes with human NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by inhibiting the immune synapse between human NK cells and target cells. Thus, these findings not only underscore the importance of 2B4-mediated immune responses in controlling CMV infections, but also unveil the shedding of a virally-encoded soluble variant of CD48 as a new viral counteract mechanism for subverting immune surveillance.","Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) have evolved to evade the immune response of their hosts by using proteins to evade the host's own immune response.

We also show that A43 binds to human 2B4 and prevents 2B4-mediated NK-cell adhesion to target cells, reducing formation of conjugates and establishment of immunological synapses in human cells. Furthermore, presence of viral protein, 2B4-mediated IFN- production and NK cell immune control are severely impaired.

It is thereby critical for proper functioning of the nervous system. Myelin in the central nervous system is synthesized by oligodendrocytes. Because myelin has a high lipid content, it is vulnerable to lipid metabolism disorders. It is unknown whether extracellular lipids also contribute to myelination by oligodendrocytes under healthy conditions, and if they do, what the origin of these lipids would be.Here, we show that formation of myelin membrane in mice does not only need lipid synthesis by oligodendrocytes, but also requires extracellular lipids provided by astrocytes. Indeed, when lipid synthesis was inactivated in either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes, myelin membrane synthesis was reduced. However, when lipid synthesis was inactivated in both cell types, myelin membrane synthesis was virtually absent. Furthermore, when lipid synthesis was inactivated in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes bypassed this deficiency by using dietary lipids for myelin membrane synthesis. Furthermore, a high-fat diet could promote myelin synthesis. We conclude that extracellular lipids, either provided by astrocytes or in the diet, contribute to myelination by oligodendrocytes during normal brain development.","The myelination of axons in the vertebrate nervous system requires large amounts of lipids proteins, oligodendrocytes Schwann cells, which are thought to autonomously assemble axon-associated glial cells. In this study, we show that oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) myelin is heavily supplemented by astrocytes in vivo, and that oligodendrocytes in the CNS myelination is significantly retarded by oligodendrocyte-specific inactivation of the sterol regulatory element (SREBP) and cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). Importantly, embryonic deletion of the gene astrocytes caused persistent hypomyelination in oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the CNS myelination appeared normal at 3 months of age. We conclude that lipid synthesis in oligodendrocytes is heavily supplemented by astrocytes in vivo, and that oligodendrocytes in the CNS myelination is significantly retarded by oligodendrocyte-specific inactivation of the sterol regulatory element (SREBP) and cleavage-activating protein (SCAP).",17.58474025974026

Freshly made proteins are typically long, structure-less chains of peptides, but shortly afterwards most of them fold into characteristic structures. Proteins execute many functions in the cell, for which they need to have the right structure, which is therefore very important in determining what the proteins can do. The structure of a protein can be determined by X-ray diffraction and other experimental approaches which are all, to this day, somewhat labor-intensive and difficult. On the other hand, the order of the peptides in a protein can be read off from the DNA blue-print, and such protein sequences are today routinely produced in large numbers. In this paper we show that many similar protein sequences can be used to find information about the structure. The basic approach is to construct a probabilistic model for sequence variability, and then to use the parameters of that model to predict structure in three-dimensional space. The main technical novelty compared to previous contributions in the same general direction is that we use models more directly matched to the data.","Correlation patterns in multiple sequence alignments refer to proteins exploited to infer information-dimensional structure members.

Since effective prevention is not available currently and the non-specific symptoms at the early stage of the disease always lead to the delay of visiting to hospital or misdiagnosis, alternative vaccinations against HTNV are of priority to overcome the problem. We defined five novel HTNV nucleoprotein CD8+ T-cell epitopes restricted by the most popular HLA alleles in Chinese Han population. For the first time, we quantitated the HTNV epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell frequency during HTNV infection and evaluated the correlations between the CD8+ T-cell response and the different outcomes of the HFRS severity. We also found that effective HTNV nucleoprotein epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were characterized by the interferon-γ secretion with a strong capacity of activation and proliferation.

We found that the CD8 + T-cell response was higher in patients with severe or critical acute stage disease than in those with mild or moderate acute stage disease. The pentamer+ CD8 + T-cell response was associated with a higher serum level and a higher level of nadir platelet counts than the single-specific CD8 + T-cell response.

The Guinean government and his partners are conducting HAT control activities to reduce the burden of this neglected tropical disease and, as set-up by WHO, to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020. Unfortunately, control efforts were deeply impaired during the Ebola outbreak that stroke the country in 2014–15. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of this unprecedented outbreak on HAT screening and caring activities. A major impact was the interruption of all active screening activities which aim, in addition of detecting and treating patients, is to clear the human reservoir of parasite and decrease transmission. Passive surveillance and diagnosis were also severely affected due to the fear of the population to come to the endemic district confirmation and treatment facilities and to the progressive banning of using rapid test in peripheral health structures, as well as the requisition of healthcare workers and facilities for the fight against Ebola. As a consequence, only 59 HAT patients were diagnosed and treated during the Ebola outbreak (from January 2014 to October 2015) as compared to 154 before the outbreak (from February 2012 to December 2013). This potentially high number of undiagnosed human reservoir of trypanosomes may have contributed in turn to increase transmission levels. A rapid revival of HAT control activities in Guinea is thus vital in order to stay in line with the 2020 elimination goal and to avoid possible bursts of the disease.","Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease caused by haemorrhagic fever and is endemic in Guinea, West Africa.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the Ebola outbreak on HAT screening and care activities in Guinea, and to compare HAT treatment characteristics with the Ebola outbreak period according to available data. We found that the number of people screened for HAT during the Ebola outbreak was significantly lower than during the pre-Ebola period, and the proportion of patients attending post-treatment follow-up visits was significantly lower than during the Ebola outbreak period. We also found that the number of people screened for HAT during the Ebola outbreak was significantly lower than during the pre-Ebola period, and the proportion of patients attending post-treatment follow-up visits was significantly lower than during the Ebola outbreak period.",19.542522167487686

We analyzed separately the DNA from men and women, and identified a genetic variant that increases the risk of developing schizophrenia in women only. The genetic variant is estimated to increase the risk of schizophrenia for women carrying the risk variant by 1.4-fold. The genetic variant is in a gene called reelin, which is known to play a part in brain development. However, it is still unclear how this genetic variant predisposes to schizophrenia nor why it is specific to women only.","Sex differences in schizophrenia are known, but the genetic basis for these differences is not.

Here we identified a novel C. albicans transporter that has no human homologue and demonstrate its role during multiple stages of candidiasis. We also show that this transporter is involved in modifying environmental pH and in filamentous growth. Additionally, deletion of DUR31 rendered cells unable to assimilate a polyamine (spermidine) as a nutrient source, but resistant to the antimicrobial peptide histatin 5. Therefore, Dur31 has multiple transport functions, which can be either beneficial or detrimental to the fungus.","Candida albicans is a major cause of oral candidiasis, a disease caused by the fungus Candida albicans.

This process is controlled by the action of several molecules that maintain cell type specific programs in response to cytokines, antigen recognition and the direct contact with T helper cells, forming a complex regulatory network. While there is a large body of experimental data regarding some of the key molecules involved in this process and there have been several efforts to reconstruct the underlying regulatory network, a general consensus about the structure and dynamical behavior of this network is lacking. Moreover, it is not well understood how this network controls the establishment of specific B cell expression patterns and how it responds to specific external signals. We present a model of the regulatory network controlling terminal B cell differentiation and analyze its dynamical behavior under normal and mutant conditions. The model recovers the patterns of differentiation of B cells and describes a large set of gain- and loss-of-function mutants. This model provides an unified framework to generate qualitative descriptions to interpret the role of intra- and extracellular regulators of B cell differentiation.",Terminal differentiation of B cells is an essential process of humoral immune response in vertebrates.

The Western diet has been implicated as an important factor, though the mechanisms by which high levels of dietary sugar and fat contribute to heart failure remain controversial.

We show that elevated levels of dietary sugar are sufficient to direct progressive heart failure in flies including arrhythmia, reduced fractional shortening, and aspects of fibrosis.

Initially, germ cells contain two copies of each chromosome, one from the mother and one from the father, which are called homologs. During meiosis, cells divide twice to produce haploid gametes with only one copy of each chromosome. Each gamete receives exactly one copy of each chromosome, because homologs become associated, through a process called meiotic pairing, and then segregate from each other during the first round of division. In Drosophila, it was assumed that homologs were always paired in every cell type. Meiotic pairing was thus viewed as an extension of a pre-existing pairing. Here, we show that chromosomes II and III are not paired in germline stem cells, which produce germ cells throughout adult life. We further show that these chromosomes become paired during the four rounds of mitosis preceding the entry in meiosis. Surprisingly, meiotic proteins are expressed during these four rounds of mitosis and are required for homologs to pair. Our results thus show that, in Drosophila, meiosis starts during the preceding mitosis.","Mitosis is a distinct cell division program in which the chromosomes pair segregate.

However, tracking of cells in which Yop injection occurred has only been described for Yersinia pestis thus far. We adapted the described reporter system specifically for the use of infections with Ye and report the usefulness and limitations of this system. Using cell culture experiments, we demonstrated that β1-integrins and the RhoGTPases RhoA and Rac1 are involved in Yop injection. Since cell culture experiments also revealed that Yop injection is detectable in a similar manner into all subpopulations of the spleen, the system can be used to detect interaction of bacteria with host cells in vivo. In a mouse infection model we found that follicular B cells, granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are the main targets of Yop injection. Interestingly, Yop-injected B cells displayed an increased activation as indicated by increased CD69 expression. In contrast, interaction of bacteria with T cells seems to be rather a rare event.

Although blood is a natural food source for these insects, its digestion releases toxic products, which poses a dietary challenge for both triatomine insects and trypanosomes. To overcome this, triatomines eliminate these toxic blood products by a unique process of heme crystallization into hemozoin that take place in their digestive tract. Here we describe that this detoxification process represents the major mechanism for redox balance control, and is necessary to allow triatomine insect reproduction, and Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Disruption of heme crystallization in triatomine insects thus represents a new venue for Chagas disease control, by targeting at the same time insect reproduction and parasite transmission.","Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by blood-feeding triatomine insect vectors.

Adequate laboratory diagnostic methods become necessary. The diagnostic method that proves infection caused by Brucella spp. is the isolation of the bacteria from body fluids or tissues, but the difficulty in obtaining positive bacterial cultures has led to the development of other diagnostic techniques. Rose Bengal test, Wright agglutination, Coombs antibrucella, immunocapture techniques, and serology to detect specific IgG and IgM antibodies usually by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are the serological methods most often used for the diagnosis of brucellosis. The use of ELISA techniques has become widespread in recent years. The detection of specific IgM by using ELISA is considered indicative of acute or recent infection. However, IgM antibody detection in the absence of IgG may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of acute brucellosis. We described a series of patients in which serology detected IgM but not IgG antibrucella antibodies.

This experiment has been repeated on many organisms and is the gold standard for extending lifespan. While we are beginning to understand how calorie restriction regulates lifespan, the mechanisms are complex and much remains to be learned. In the work presented here, we demonstrate a novel way to increase lifespan in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our strategy is to lower the rate of sphingolipid synthesis either by reducing the synthesis of the first enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway or by using a drug to reduce enzyme activity. This strategy works in part by lowering the activity of a protein kinase, termed Sch9 in yeast and S6K in mammals, both of which are involved in the processes affected by calorie restriction and that control lifespan. In addition, we find that reducing sphingolipid synthesis increases lifespan in ways that are independent of Sch9 and calorie restriction. Since sphingolipids are found in all eukaryotes, our results suggest that pharmacological down-regulation of one or more sphingolipids may provide a means to reduce age-related diseases and increase lifespan in other eukaryotes.","The human lifespan is rapidly advancing, and the lifespan complex phenotype is likely to be identified.

As mutations in introns do not affect protein sequences, they are usually ignored when looking for normal or pathogenic genomic variation. However, introns comprise about half of the human non-coding genome and they can have important regulatory roles. We show that deletions of intronic regions appear more frequent than previously expected in the healthy population, with a significant proportion of genes with evolutionary ancient and essential functions carrying them. This finding was very surprising, as ancient genes tend to have high conservation of their coding sequence. However, we show that deletions of their non-coding intronic sequence can produce considerable changes in their locus length. We found that a significant number of these intronic deletions are associated with under- or over-expression of the affected genes or distant genes interacting in 3D.

Here, we combine extensive maps of copy number variants (CNVs) in human populations, found intronic losses frequent copy number variants (CNVs) of protein-coding genes human, and 12,986 intronic deletions, affecting 4,147 genes (including 1,154 essential genes and 1,638 disease-related genes). We show that intronic loss is frequent in evolutionarily ancient genes highly conserved protein sequence level. We also show that intronic loss is associated with significant differences in gene expression levels in the population (CNV-eQTLs). Our data suggest that intronic loss makes important contribution to variability in gene expression in splicing human populations.",13.854310344827589

This is particularly critical for identifying degraded input. However, the underlying neural mechanism by which expectations influence sensory processing is unclear. Predictive Coding theories suggest that the brain passes forward the unexpected part of the sensory input while expected properties are suppressed (i.e., Prediction Error). However, evidence to rule out the opposite mechanism in which the expected part of the sensory input is enhanced or sharpened (i.e., Sharpening) has been lacking. In this study, we investigate the neural mechanisms by which sensory clarity and prior knowledge influence the perception of degraded speech. A univariate measure of brain activity obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is in line with both neural mechanisms (Prediction Error and Sharpening). However, combining multivariate fMRI measures with computational simulations allows us to determine the underlying mechanism. Our key finding was an interaction between sensory input and prior expectations: for unexpected speech, increasing speech clarity increases the amount of information represented in sensory brain areas. In contrast, for speech that matches prior expectations, increasing speech clarity reduces the amount of this information. Our observations are uniquely simulated by a model of speech perception that includes Prediction Errors.","Speech perception relies on the combination of sensory input and prior knowledge.

Parasitic cysts develop most commonly in the liver and are diagnosed primarily by ultrasound. Serology helps with diagnosis, particularly when ultrasound features are unclear. Unfortunately, in underserved endemic rural areas, expertise in ultrasound diagnosis of CE may be scant, and conventional serology techniques are unavailable due to the lack of laboratory equipment. In these circumstances, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) may be very useful. In this work, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of three RDTs and compared them with a commercial ELISA test routinely used in our diagnostic laboratory. Our results show that RDTs have overall comparable performances to ELISA in the diagnosis of hepatic CE in well-defined stages, although significant differences exist among them. If confirmed and expanded on a bigger cohort, these results would support the use of RDTs instead of conventional techniques to complement imaging in the diagnosis of CE.","The diagnosis of echinococcosis (CE) is based primarily on imaging of the abdominal ultrasound, and the abdominal ultrasound is the gold standard for CE diagnosis.

In this study, we evaluated 3 commercial RDTs for CE diagnosis in a group of patients with single CE cysts-defined ultrasound. We found that the VIRapid test was more sensitive than the other two RDTs, and that the ADAMU-CE test was significantly more sensitive than the other two RDTs.

In this study we assessed the minimum sensitivity level of such a (hypothetical) diagnostic test and the optimal testing strategy in order to effectively reduce the new case detection rate (NCDR) of leprosy. We showed that a diagnostic test for subclinical leprosy could substantially reduce the NCDR in a high, medium and low endemic population. A significant impact could already be achieved at a test sensitivity level of 50%. To effectively reduce the NCDR in the short run, a population survey is preferred over household contact tracing.

The intensive cultivation particularly of clonally propagated crop plants increases the potential for the emergence and rapid spread of new diseases. Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae was first reported as a canker-causing pathogen of kiwifruit in the mid-1980s. However, a new outbreak of the disease occurred in 2008 and this strain has spread rapidly throughout growing regions of the world. In order to determine the origin, population structure and defining features of this pathogen, a large-scale sequencing project was established. This clarified the phylogenetic relationships between the different Psa isolates and identified the outbreak-specific gene sets associated with the aggressive systemic infection strategy exhibited by the virulent strain. This information is invaluable in developing robust long-term solutions for this serious disease. Given that kiwifruit production on a commercial scale is a relatively recent event, this analysis provides a unique insight into the evolution of this pathogen with its host, from its first emergence to the latest global outbreak. This understanding should aid in the mitigation of devastating outbreaks in the future.","Actinidiae (Psa) and Actinidia chinensis (Psa-V) are two of the most common vascular pathogens in the world.

Theoretical studies have generated a broad consensus in the field that knowledge of the contact network may help to greatly improve the control of the spread of epidemics. The key problem in the field, however, is that we lack knowledge regarding the actual contact structure underlying real epidemics. Much research is focused on trying to reconstruct actual contact networks in various ways (mobile phone usage data, electronic devices that measure physical proximity, patient interviews, etc). All of these approaches are highly labour intensive and are fraught with many difficulties. Here, we present a new approach which is based on readily available sequence data. Using the Swiss HIV epidemic as an example, we show that it displays strong indications of a underlying contact structure that strongly differs from random interactions, thus undercutting the assumption of random mixing which is commonly made in epidemiological models.","The structure of contact networks is a key factor in the spread of infectious diseases.

This phenomenon is ubiquitous, as proteins frequently must adapt their behavior to changes in the cellular milieu. The mechanism(s) underlying allostery remains incompletely understood. In particular, predictive models are needed that distinguish amino-acid residues that are critical to allostery, or “hotspots”, from non-hotspots. Here we have used data-mining approaches to infer rules that distinguish hotspots from non-hotspots. Starting with a data set of known hotspot and non-hotspot residues from a diverse set of allosteric proteins, the training data set, we applied machine learning to this data to “learn” models, or sets of rules, for distinguishing hotspots and non-hotspots by inferring associations between the classification (hotspot or non-hotspot) and an associated set of calculated attributes. Many models that showed the highest predictive power on the training data also exhibited high accuracy and sensitivity when applied to an independent data set. Moreover, the pattern of predicted hotspots in the proteins we studied was consistent with known structure/function relationships and previous work suggesting that a network of essential residues mediates the allosteric transition.","Allostery is the mechanism by which a protein binds to an event site and relays the signal to the next site.

We performed independent data set consisting of hotspots from a diverse set of allosteric proteins. Our models were able to identify hotspots from the independent data set with high accuracy and sensitivity.

For example, cell divisions in the early embryo often occur in a directional manner to maintain specific cell–cell interactions. Later, during organ formation, tissues may be shaped through polar cell migration. During apoptosis, a neighbouring cell engulfing a cell corpse utilizes polar positional information to deform its cytoskeleton and migrate around the corpse. Wnt pathway signalling is a common mechanism by which cells establish polarity during development, but how a single Wnt signal is translated into different outcomes in different cellular or developmental contexts is not clear. Our data on C. elegans suggest that during diverse directional events—cell engulfment, mitotic spindle movement, and cell migration—different Wnt ligands or a specific signal from a cell corpse signals to the Wnt receptor Frizzled (MOM-5 in C. elegans) and on to the downstream factors CED-10/Rac. But specificity of the Wnt signal is mediated by the use of distinct intermediate signal transduction pathways. Our discovery that this pathway is also used for engulfment of cell corpses led us to propose that the two parallel pathways, originally described for engulfment of corpses, are indeed parts of one pathway involving Wnt pathway components.","Wnt signalling pathways are extremely diverse in animals, including induction of cell fates in tumours, guidance of cell movements gastrulation, induction of cell polarity, and induction of cell morphology remodelling.

In dividing animal cells, microtubules are arranged radially around two centrosomes, promoting the correct distribution of DNA into daughter cells. As cells differentiate, microtubules become organized at non-centrosomal sites, often yielding decentralized microtubule arrays. Although a large body of work has focused on understanding how microtubules are grown from and organized by the centrosome, very little is known about how these activities are performed at non-centrosomal sites. We optimized a technique to degrade proteins in C. elegans differentiated cells, specifically testing the role of essential centrosome proteins in building non-centrosomal microtubules, which emanate from the apical membrane in embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. Surprisingly, we found fundamental differences between the centrosome and membrane, both in the mechanisms that recruit microtubule regulators to each site, and in the proteins that are required to build and organize microtubules. In addition, we found that when fewer microtubules grew from membranes, the remaining microtubules grew faster, suggesting competition for limited materials. Together, our study highlights differences in how centrosomes and membranes grow and organize microtubules, and that multiple pathways contribute membrane-organized microtubules.","Non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) have been found in differentiated cells, and structures regulate microtubule organization dynamics largely unknown.

The high mutation rate and diversity of HIV strains enables the virus to effectively evade host immune responses, presenting a significant challenge for HIV vaccine design. We have developed an approach to translate clinical databases of HIV sequences into mathematical models quantifying the capacity of the virus to replicate as a function of mutations within its genome. We have previously shown how such “fitness landscapes” can be used to guide the design of vaccines to attack vulnerable regions from which it is difficult for the virus to escape by mutation. Here, using new modeling approaches, we have improved on our previous models of HIV fitness landscape by accounting for undersampling of HIV sequences and the specific identity of mutant amino acids. We experimentally tested the accuracy of the improved models to predict the fitness of HIV with multiple mutations in the Gag protein. The experimental data are in strong agreement with model predictions, supporting the value of these models as a novel approach for determining mutational vulnerabilities of HIV-1, which, in turn, can inform vaccine design.","Viral immune evasion is a major hindrance to the design of HIV-1 vaccines. In order to design a vaccine that is effective against HIV-1 infection, it is important to understand the fitness landscape of HIV-1 proteins.

In this paper, the authors show that the Cyp40-like Cpr7p prolyl isomerase of yeast can effectively inhibit tombusvirus replication. This inhibition is due to binding of the TPR (tetratricopeptide repeats) domain of Cpr7p to the RNA-binding region of the tombusvirus replication proteins that leads to inhibition of RNA binding by the viral replication proteins, interference with the assembly of the viral replicase and blocking viral RNA synthesis. Cpr7p is also effective against the distantly-related alfanodaviruses of insects. Overall, this work reveals a role for a Cyp40-like protein as a regulator of RNA virus replication.

Gene regulatory interactions between one conceptus and the surrounding maternal tissue vary between endometrial regions containing or lacking glands.

Hox transcription factors specify different cell fates by regulating the expression of downstream genes, many of which are part of cell signaling pathways.

The cells that receive the signal are induced to become essential hepatocyte-like cells required for metabolism and animal growth. Here, we show that this same Hox factor is not only required for sending the EGF signal, but it also enhances the strength of the signal within the developing hepatocyte-like cells. Importantly, the thoracic Hox factor fails to both induce and enhance the signal, thereby providing a better understanding of how these abdomen-specific cells are generated and distinct morphological structures become regionalized to specific segments of the embryo.","Epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling is a major regulator of cell fate.

However, these studies are limited to examining few individuals for shorts amounts of time, due to the lack of effective computational tools for the analysis of large groups over prolonged time. To overcome this hurdle, we built a new behavioral arena and developed new software that accurately tracks many flies simultaneously over long time periods. The arena is cheap and easy to build and the software works with low resolution videos. Using these improved tools, we studied social isolation in groups of male flies. We found that isolation caused flies to form stronger interactions with neighboring flies in their social network. These behavioral changes were preceded by transient changes in the expression of metabolism genes and eventually resulted in isolated flies accumulating fat, as has been previously observed in studies in mice and humans.

In many bacterial pathogens, the type III secretion system is used to inject these virulence factors directly to the cytoplasm of the host cell. The secreted proteins do not have well-conserved sequences and do not have any kind of common identifiable signal sequence to target them for secretion. This makes it very difficult to identify secreted proteins of this kind without experimental investigation, as can be done in other secretion systems. In this study, we develop a computational approach to detect secreted virulence factors from genomic protein sequences. We use this method to compare the N-terminal regions of proteins from S. Typhimurium and a plant pathogen, P. syringae, and show that this approach is the most effective method of computational identification of type III secreted proteins to date. We further use this approach to identify a sequence pattern in these proteins that presumably helps direct virulence proteins to the type III secretion apparatus.

The movement (extravasation) of leukocytes from the bloodstream to the surrounding tissue is a prerequisite for proper host defense. Platelets are anucleate cell particles that circulate in the blood and play a fundamental role in hemostasis. Here, we report a previously unrecognized function of platelets as ""pathfinders"" guiding leukocytes to their site of extravasation. Upon onset of the inflammatory response, platelets were found to immediately adhere to specific sites in the smallest venular microvessels. At these ""hot spots"", platelets capture intravascularly crawling neutrophils and, in turn, inflammatory monocytes. The cellular crosstalk arising from these interactions leads to conformational changes of distinct adhesion molecules on the surface of leukocytes, subsequently promoting the extravasation of these immune cells to the inflamed tissue. Conversely, blockade of this cellular partnership leads to misguided and inefficient leukocyte responses. Thus, platelet-directed guidance of leukocytes to confined sites of extravasation appears to be a critical step in the recruitment process of immune cells, which might emerge as a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory pathologies.","Inflammation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the immune response is an important component of this response. However, little is known about the role of platelets in directing leukocytes to the site of injury.

Dysfunction of multicilia arising from genetic perturbations is most prominently associated with a devastating disorder called primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a rare genetic disease characterized by hydrocephalus, chronic airway infection, and infertility. Furthermore, defective airway multicilia have been implicated in several respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). While important to human health, the detailed molecular mechanisms of how multiciliated cells develop remain largely unknown. Here, we establish a new mouse model that lacks the key ciliary protein CEP164 in multiciliated cells. These mice recapitulate many symptoms of PCD patients such as hydrocephalus and infertility. We show that, in the absence of CEP164, differentiation of airway multiciliated cells is severely perturbed at multiple steps. Importantly, our data also suggest that CEP164 differentially regulates the proper recruitment of membrane-associated ciliary proteins.

Until now, little was known about whether proteins aggregate in a non-disease context.

These aggregation-prone proteins have distinct structural and functional proprieties. We asked if this inherent age-dependent protein aggregation impacts neurodegenerative diseases. We found that proteins similar to those aggregating in old worms have also been identified as minor components of human disease aggregates. In addition, we showed that higher levels of inherent protein aggregation aggravated toxicity in a C. elegans Huntington's disease model. Inherent protein aggregation is a new biomarker of aging.

Identification of “promising” target sites is therefore of importance for any pathogen. This crucial step of the infection is still poorly understood. Here, we have studied target site selection by the flagellated Gram-negative gut pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium. Using a well-established tissue culture model system, we found that flagella-driven motility forces the bacterium into a “near surface swimming” mode which facilitates “scanning” of the host cell surface. The near surface swimming was found to target the pathogen towards sites with particular topological features, i.e., rounded cells and membrane ruffles. This explains how S. Typhimurium “identifies” particular target sites and infects membrane ruffles in a cooperative manner. Interestingly, the near surface swimming is attributable to generic physical principles acting on moving particles. Therefore, our findings might be of general importance for the infection by motile pathogens.","In the bacterium S.

The fungus makes a small molecule called gliotoxin which helps A. fumigatus bypass the immune system in ill people, and cause disease. Although a small molecule, gliotoxin biosynthesis is enabled by a complex series of enzymes, one of which is called GliT, in A. fumigatus. Amazingly, nobody has really considered that gliotoxin might be toxic to A. fumigatus itself. Here we show that absence of GliT makes A. fumigatus highly sensitive to added gliotoxin and inhibits fungal growth, both of which can be reversed by restoring GliT. Neither can the fungus make or release its own gliotoxin when GliT is missing. We also show that gliotoxin sensitivity can be totally overcome by adding glutathione, which is an important anti-oxidant within cells. We demonstrate that gliotoxin addition increases the production of GliT, and that GliT breaks the disulphide bond in gliotoxin which may be a step in the pathway for gliotoxin protection or release from A. fumigatus.

Here we report the novel observation that in heterozygous cases of sporadic CJD the PrPSc allotype ratio is highly variable. This case-by-case variability is consistent with the origin of sporadic CJD being the spontaneous, but random, misfolding of either host prion protein allotype into infectious PrPSc. By contrast, in heterozygous cases of iatrogenic CJD in the United Kingdom resulting from exposure to contaminated human growth hormone, the PrPSc allotype ratio is much more homogeneous and consistent with exposure to infectious PrPSc containing valine at residue 129. Surprisingly, the PrPSc allotype ratio did not correlate with disease onset or duration in either disease type. Thus, factors other than PrPSc allotype ratio likely influence the clinical progression of heterozygous cases of CJD.

Previous studies have identified patterns of ASE across human populations for single cell-types; however the degree of tissue-specificity of ASE has not been deeply characterized. In this study, we compare patterns of ASE across multiple tissues from a single individual using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and a targeted, high-resolution assay (mmPCR-Seq). We detect patterns of ASE for rare deleterious and loss-of-function protein-coding variants, informing the frequency at which allelic expression could modify the functional impact of personal deleterious protein-coding across tissues.

However, we have discovered that inactivation of YPD1 in the major human pathogen, Candida albicans, actually enhances virulence. Furthermore, we reveal that this fungus adapts to the sustained activation of the Hog1 SAPK triggered by Ypd1 loss by mounting distinct mechanisms that actively reduce the level of phosphorylated Hog1. These findings question the validity of Ypd1 proteins as broad-spectrum antifungal targets and provide insights into the cellular adaptation to sustained SAPK activation.","Candida albicans, a major fungal pathogen in humans, is known for its ability to survive sustained activation of the Hog1 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK).

MYXV-encoded protein M013, a member of the cellular PYRIN domain-containing superfamily of proteins, was previously shown to be important for virus virulence by blocking inflammasome regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Here, we report that, in addition to targeting the ASC-1 protein of the host cell inflammasome complex, M013 also blocks activation of NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting with NF-κB1 and preventing nuclear translocation of the transcription factor RelA/p65. MYXV virus lacking a functional M013L gene (vMyxM013-KO) induced the early activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in human monocytic cells, causing the secretion of antiviral pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo.

We proposed that scabies mites play a role in the establishment, proliferation and transmission of opportunistic pathogens. We investigated here the synergy between mites and one of the most recognised mite associated pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes. As part of the innate immune response mammals have a pre-programmed ability to recognise and immediately act against substances derived from fungal and bacterial microorganisms. This is mediated through a sequential biochemical cascade involving over 30 different proteins (complement system) which as a result of signal amplification triggers a rapid killing response. The complement cascade produces peptides that attract immune cells, increases vascular permeability, coats (opsonises) the surfaces of a pathogen, marking it for destruction, and directly disrupts foreign plasma membranes. To prevent complement mediated damage of their gut cells, scabies mites secrete several classes of complement inhibiting proteins into the mite gut and excrete them into the epidermal mite burrows. Furthermore, these inhibitors also provide protection for S. pyogenes. We verified here specifically the impact of the mite complement inhibitor SMSB4, to identify the molecular mechanisms behind the long recognised tendency of S. pyogenes to infect mite-induced skin lesions.","Scabies are a common cause of pyoderma in the tropics.

Vaccination against VL has received limited attention compared with cutaneous leishmaniasis, although the need for an effective vaccine is pressing for the control of the disease.

However, this route of immunization is not adequate for human use. For this work, we developed vaccine formulations combining cationic liposomes with MPL-TDM using recombinant GP63 (rGP63) as protein Ag through the clinically relevant subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Two s.c. injections with rGP63 in association with cationic liposomes and MPL-TDM showed enhanced immune responses that further resulted in high protective levels against VL in the mouse model.

The chromosomes are moved by attachment to the long microtubule polymers of the mitotic spindle, formed from a centrosome at each end of the spindle. Mechanisms that restrict DNA replication and centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle are critical, as defects in either event result in genetic instability and are associated with cancer. Cell cycle-dependent control of DNA replication has been extensively studied, but comparatively little is known about the regulation of centrosome duplication, particularly its restriction to once per cell cycle. Using genetics and cytology, including super-resolution imaging to detect reduplicated centrosomes, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation of Sfi1, a conserved component of centrosomes, prevents the occurrence of extra rounds of yeast centrosome duplication during the cell cycle. Additionally, we propose that dephosphorylation of Sfi1 by the phosphatase Cdc14 permits centrosome duplication for the next cell cycle. Our work is the first to provide a mechanism for how centrosome duplication, like DNA replication, occurs once during the cell cycle through cyclin-dependent kinase regulation.","Du centrosomes play a central role in the cell cycle and are essential for the maintenance of bipolar spindle formation and chromosome segregation.

We established two independent lines of HPV38 E6/E7 Tg mice and showed that they both have an increased susceptibility to develop squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in comparison to the wild-type animals when exposed to chemical carcinogens and UV irradiation. Most interestingly, we found that UV irradiation of the Tg animals, promoted the formation of skin lesions that closely resembled the SCC-precursor lesions in humans, actinic keratosis and subsequently SCC.

As germ cells mature into sperm and oocytes, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are deliberately created on each chromosome and a subset of DSBs is repaired to form meiotic crossovers between homologous chromosomes. Because germ cells must undergo this programmed process of deliberate DNA damage and repair, identifying repair factors active in germ cells and determining the requirement of their functions in meiotic DSB repair are important first steps in understanding infertility and developmental disorders caused by defective sperm and oocytes. In this manuscript, we find that the evolutionarily conserved SMC-5 and SMC-6 proteins fulfill a critical role in preserving genomic stability in germ cells in C. elegans. Our findings further describe the genetic mechanisms by which the C. elegans SMC-5/6 proteins function in meiotic DSB repair. These data reveal that inter-sister homologous recombination, a repair mechanism thought to function as a back-up repair method in meiosis, serves a more significant role in normal meiosis than was previously appreciated.","Meiosis is a process in which DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by recombination (HR) to promote accurate segregation of chromosomes. In general, DSBs are formed by a series of inter-crossovers, which are processed by the sister- chromatid (inter-sister) recombination. The sister- chromatid-mediated repair of DSBs is essential for the complete meiotic segregation of chromosomes. Here, we show that the sister- chromatid-mediated repair of DSBs is essential for the complete meiotic segregation of chromosomes.

Since obesity rates in children have been increasing in recent years, they may explain part of the rise in T1D rates. However, conventional observational epidemiologic studies are limited in explaining causality because of possible bias from unmeasured confounding and reverse causation.We investigated if genetic variants associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) were also associated with T1D risk in 5,913 T1D and 8,828 control samples.We studied the effect of childhood adiposity on T1D using a Mendelian randomization analysis framework, which uses genetic variants associated with an exposure as instruments to test for effects on an outcome. Since alleles are randomly allocated before birth, Mendelian randomization studies limit bias from confounding factors and reverse causation. We used sensitivity analyses to control for violations of Mendelian randomization assumptions.We estimated that a genetically predicted increase in childhood BMI by 1 standard deviation is associated with an average 32% increased risk of T1D (odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.06–1.64).This study provides genetic support for a link between childhood adiposity and T1D risk, which could help explain part of the increase in T1D rates.However, as the underlying genes and adiposity-increasing mechanisms for most of the genetic variants included in the study are not known, there is a possibility that the genetic variants affect T1D risk through other mechanisms than through adiposity, which would limit causal inference.Together with previous studies, our findings reinforce the need to address rising childhood overweight and obesity rates, whose adverse consequences in adulthood pose serious challenges to personal and population health.","The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing globally and is rare. The hypothesis is that increasing childhood obesity rates explain the increase, but, T1D rare, intervention studies challenging perform.

Here, we analyze thirteen epigenetic mark maps in the human cell line K562 at 100 kb resolution of MRT data. The complexity of epigenetic data is reduced to four chromatin states that display remarkable similarities with those reported in fly, worm and plants. These states have different MRT: (C1) is transcriptionally active, early replicating, enriched in CTCF; (C2) is Polycomb repressed, mid-S replicating; (C3) lacks of marks and replicates late and (C4) is a late-replicating gene-poor HP1 repressed heterochromatin state. When mapping these states inside the 876 replication U-domains of K562, the replication fork polarity gradient observed in these U-domains comes along with a remarkable epigenetic organization from C1 at U-domain borders to C2, C3 and ultimately C4 at centers. The remaining genome half displays early replicating, gene rich and high GC domains of intermingled C1 and C2 states segregating from late replicating, gene poor and low GC domains of concatenated C3 and/or C4 states. This constitutes the first evidence of epigenetic compartmentalization of the human genome into replication domains likely corresponding to autonomous units in the 3D chromatin architecture.","Epigenetic modifications have been shown to play a key role in transcription regulation of genome activity and development of differentiation response to the environment. However, molecular mechanisms regulate initiation and maintenance of spatio-temporal replication program in higher eukaryotes, particular links between epigenetic modifications and replication timing remain elusive.

Meiosis is the specialized cellular program in which a diploid cell gives rise to haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. Crossing-over between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (homologs) is a central feature of this program, playing a role not only for increasing genetic diversity but also for ensuring regular segregation of homologs at the first meiotic division. The distribution of crossovers (COs) along meiotic chromosomes is a paradigmatic example of spatial patterning. Crossovers occur at different positions in different meiotic nuclei but, nonetheless, tend to be evenly spaced along the chromosomes. We previously-described a mechanical “stress and stress relief” model for CO patterning with an accompanying mathematical description (the “beam-film model”). In this paper we explore the roles of mathematical parameters in this model; show that it can very accurately describe experimental data sets from several organisms, in considerably quantitative depth; and discuss implications of the model for several phenomena that are directly related to crossover patterning, including the features which can ensure that every chromosome always acquires at least one crossover.","Meiotic crossover (CO) is a feature of meiosis that occurs at the central feature of meiosis, the crosstalk between two chromosomes.

Of these, approximately one-third will develop chronic disease pathology, leading to disability and premature death. Only two drugs are available, both of which can have severe side effects. We know relatively little about the chronic phase of this infection because the parasite burden is extremely low, and animal models have limitations. Here, we describe a T. cruzi reporter strain that has been genetically modified to express a fusion protein which is both bioluminescent and fluorescent. These parasites can be monitored throughout the infection, and individual parasites identified in tissue sections from infected mice. This allows us for the first time to analyse host-parasite interactions at a cellular level in the chronic phase of infection. We have also incorporated a streamlined version of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system into the reporter strain. We demonstrated the utility of this system by generating null mutants in the flagellar attachment protein GP72, by replacing the green fluorescent protein with a red fluorescent protein, and by tagging the endogenous protein DNA topoisomerase 1A.

Due to size constraints, newly formed nucleocapsids are unable to leave the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. Instead herpesviruses apply an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for nuclear export of capsids called nuclear egress. This process is initiated by docking of capsids at the inner nuclear membrane, budding of enveloped capsids into the perinuclear space followed by de-envelopment and release of capsids to the cytoplasm where further maturation occurs. Two viral proteins conserved throughout the herpesvirus family, the membrane protein pUL34 and the phosphoprotein pUL31 form the nuclear egress complex that is critical for primary envelopment. We show here that pUL31 and pUL34 enter the nucleus independently of each other. pUL31 is targeted to the nucleoplasm where it binds to nucleocapsids via the conserved C-terminal domain, while its N-terminal domain is important for capsid translocation to the nuclear envelope and for a coordinated interaction with pUL34. Our data suggest a mechanism that is apparently conserved among all herpesviruses with pUL31 escorting nucleocapsids to the nuclear envelope in order to couple capsid maturation with primary envelopment.","In herpesviruses, the nuclear envelope of the nucleus is formed by a series of small nucleocapsids.

Drosophila sechellia, a fruit fly endemic to the Seychelles, feeds exclusively on the ripe fruit of Morinda citrifolia, a tropical plant commonly known as Tahitian Noni. Although other fruit flies never approach this fruit because of its toxins, D. sechellia is resistant and is actually attracted by the same toxins. D. sechellia is a close relative of D. melanogaster, an established model species of genetics. By comparing D. melanogaster and D. sechellia, we revealed that two genes encoding odorant-binding proteins, Obp57d and Obp57e, are not only involved in the fruit fly's taste perception, but can also change the behavioral response of the flies to the toxins contained in the fruit. By knowing how an insect's food preference is determined by its genes, we can gain insight into how insect lifestyles evolve and investigate whether such changes can lead to the formation of new species. We can also begin to understand how to manipulate insects' behavior by changing their preference for particular substances.","The Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) species complex has evolved distinct physiological adaptations to the host plant Morinda citrifolia, commonly known as Tahitian Noni.

In our current study, we elucidated novel anti-neoplastic properties of PARP inhibitors that are responsible for the anti-metastatic effect of these drugs in the context of malignant melanoma.

These fibers are organized in elaborate structures that form sarcomeres in the muscle and the contractile ring during cytokinesis. In cytokinesis, the establishment of an equatorial actomyosin ring is preceded and regulated by many cell cycle events, and the ring itself is a complex and dynamic structure. Here we report the presence of an equatorial circumferential actomyosin structure with remarkable similarities to the cytokinetic ring formed in postmitotic notochord cells of sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. The notochord is a transient rod-like structure found in all embryos that belong to the phylum Chordata, and in Ciona, a simple chordate, it consists of only 40 cylindrical cells arranged in a single file, which elongate individually during development. Our study shows that the activity of the equatorial actomyosin ring is required for the elongation of the notochord cells. We also find that cortical flow contributes significantly to the formation of the ring at the equator. Similar to cytokinetic cells, we observe the formation of membrane blebs outside the equatorial region. Our analyses suggest that cooperation of actomyosin ring-based circumferential constriction and bleb-associated contractions drive cell elongation in Ciona. We conclude that cells can utilize a cytokinesis-like force generation mechanism to promote cell shape change instead of cell division.","Cell shape changes are fundamental strategies for morphogenesis in animal development. In this study, we show that the actomyosin network forming the equator notochord cell includes phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain, -actinin, cofilin, and tropomyosin, talin. Cortical flow contributes to assembly of actomyosin ring. Similar to cytokinetic cells, membrane blebs cause local contractions form the basal cortex to participate in force generation. Our results demonstrate that cytokinesis-like contractile mechanism co-opted completely different developmental scenarios to achieve cell shape change instead cell division.",12.726365591397851

Genome-scale metabolic models, with the assumption of steady state for the internal metabolites, allow the definition of a region of feasible metabolic flux distributions. This space of solutions can be further constrained using experimental flux measurements (normally production or uptake rates of external compounds). Here a random sampling method was used to obtain average values and standard deviations for all the reaction rates in a genome-scale model. These values were used to quantify the significance of changes in metabolic fluxes between different conditions. The significance in flux changes can be compared to the changes in gene transcription of the corresponding enzymes. Our method allowed for identification of specific reactions that are transcriptionally regulated, and we further identified that these reactions can be ascribed to a few key transcription factors. This suggests that the regulation of metabolism has evolved to contain a few flux-regulating transcription factors that could be the target for genetic manipulations in order to redirect fluxes.","Genome-scale metabolic models have been used for many years to define the region of feasible metabolic states in organisms.

The high mutation rate of RNA viruses increases the ability of these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts and cause new human and zoonotic diseases. The genetic diversity of a viral population within a host may allow the virus to adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures and enable cross-species transmission events.

To better understand the evolution of rabies virus that enabled this host jump, we applied deep-sequencing analysis to rabies virus samples from the outbreak. Deep-sequencing data indicated that many of the genetic changes associated with host jump occurred prior to 2009, and these mutations were present at very low frequencies in viral populations from samples dating back to 1995.

However, how CO regulates FT expression in the context of chromatin remains largely obscure. In this work, we present Arabidopsis MRG1/2 as novel chromatin effectors directly involved in the CO-FT photoperiodic flowering. Firstly, MRG1/2 proteins are identified as recognition factors of H3K4 and H3K36 methylation via their chromodomains. The mrg1 mrg2 double mutant shows a late-flowering phenotype only under long-day conditions through down-regulation of FT but not of CO. MRG2 can directly target in vivo the FT promoter chromatin in a H3K4me3/H3K36me3-level dependent manner. More importantly, MRG2 and CO physically interact and enhance each other's binding to the FT promoter in planta. Determination of co-crystal structures of MRG2 with H3K4me3/H3K36me3 peptides and mutagenesis of a key amino acid residue involved in structural interaction demonstrate that MRG2 reader activity is essential for in planta function.

Under the assumptions of the neutral model of molecular evolution, the amount of variation present in a population should be directly proportional to the size of the population. However, this prediction does not tally with real-life observations: levels of genetic diversity are found to be substantially more uniform, even among species with widely differing population sizes, than expected. Because natural selection—which removes genetically linked neutral variation—is more efficient in larger populations, selection on novel mutations offers a potential reconciliation of this paradox. In this work, we align and jointly analyze whole genome genetic variation data from a wide variety of species. Using this dataset and population genetic models of the impact of selection on neutral variation, we test the prediction that selection will disproportionally remove neutral variation in species with large population sizes. We show that genomic signature of natural selection is pervasive across most species, and that the amount of linked neutral variation removed by selection correlates with proxies for population size. We propose that pervasive natural selection constrains neutral diversity and provides an explanation for why neutral diversity does not scale as expected with population size.","The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that neutral polymorphisms in a species increase proportionally to the census population size of the species. However, the range of neutral polymorphisms in a species is comparatively narrow.

Using different approaches, we have detected the orthologues EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 proteins in Entamoeba histolytica. Trophozoites are particularly rich in membranes and vacuoles, but they do not possess the machinery to synthetize cholesterol. Thus, they are completely dependent on molecules able to “fish” cholesterol from the medium. The relevance of our findings lies in the fact that cholesterol is fundamental for endocytosis and motility; and, phagocytosis is an important nutritional and virulence factor for E. histolytica. In silico and experimental strategies, using U18666A to arrest cholesterol trafficking, as well as, knockdown mutants, showed that EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 participate in cholesterol uptake and trafficking in this parasite. They are secreted by trophozoites and directly involved in erythrophagocytosis and motility. Our findings revealed E. histolytica as one of the first protozoa in which these proteins are being characterized. Moreover, E. histolytica provides an excellent and less complicated model to elucidate the intricate event of cholesterol trafficking in eukaryotic cells.

In this paper, we identify stem cells as having the highest levels of SMN. The concentration of SMN then decreases in a declining gradient until it reaches its lowest level in differentiated cells. SMN reduction, using clonal analysis, slows stem cell division and can lead to stem cell loss. These defects correlate with a reduction in the U2 and U5 small nuclear RNAs and with the mislocalisation of Miranda protein in postembryonic neuroblasts.

Its infectious agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is transmitted mainly by the feces of insects called triatomines.

By contrast, it is unknown how frequently epigenetic variation causes differences in organismal phenotypes. Epigenetic information is closely associated with but not encoded in the DNA sequence. In practice, it is challenging to disentangle genetic variation from epigenetic variation, as what appears to be epigenetic variation might have an underlying genetic basis. DNA methylation is one form of epigenetic information. HDG3 encodes an endosperm specific transcription factor that exists in two states in A. thaliana natural populations: methylated and expressed and hypomethylated and repressed. We show that pure epigenetic variation is sufficient to explain expression variation of HDG3 - a naturally lowly expressed allele can be switched to a higher expressed state by adding DNA methylation. We also show that expression of HDG3 in strains where it is normally hypomethylated and relatively repressed causes a seed development phenotype. These data indicate that naturally circulating epialleles have consequences for seed phenotypic variation.","Epigenetic variation has been linked to phenotypic variation in mammals, but the contribution of epigenetic variation to phenotypic variation is unclear. In mammals, a subset of genes expressed parental alleles are expressed in a process called gene imprinting. Imprinting is associated with differential DNA modifications of parental alleles.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which imprinting is associated with differential DNA modifications of parental alleles. We found that the transcription factor HDG3 is expressed primarily in methylated paternally inherited alleles, and that the expression of HDG3 is increased in a non- imprinted strain. We also found that the expression of HDG3 is increased in a non- imprinted strain. Our results indicate that epigenetic variation is sufficient to explain imprinting variation and demonstrate that epialleles variation underlie seed development phenotypes.",15.251944444444447

How this genome instability begins has not been defined, except in cases of familial cancers, which often have mutations in genes called “caretaker” genes, necessary to preserve DNA stability. We have defined a mechanism for genome instability in non-familial tumors that occur sporadically in the population. Certain fragile regions of our DNA are more difficult to duplicate during cell division and are prone to breakage. A fragile region, FRA3B, lies within the FHIT gene, and deletions within FRA3B are common in precancer cells, causing loss of Fhit protein expression. We find that loss of Fhit protein causes defective DNA replication, leading to further DNA breaks. Cells that continue DNA replication in the absence of Fhit develop numerous chromosomal aberrations. Importantly, cells established from tissues of mice that are missing Fhit undergo selection for increasing DNA alterations that can promote immortality, a cancer cell hallmark. Thus, loss of Fhit expression in precancer cells is the first step in the initiation of genomic instability and facilitates cancer development.","Genomic instability drives tumorigenesis, initiated by sporadic neoplasias and unknown. Early preneoplasias, alterations in chromosome fragile sites arise from DNA replication stress, leading to loss of Fhit protein expression.

As a common mechanism, animals, plants and fungi use a large arsenal of carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) to protect themselves from predation and parasitism. The success of this type of innate defence mechanism critically depends on the diversity of specific recognition of foreign carbohydrate structures by the host lectins. In this study, we use NMR structure determination to show that part of this diversity is created by the plasticity of common protein folds. The identified fungal lectin that is toxic to nematodes and insects, adopts a common lectin fold but is remarkable in terms of its specificity and affinity for the recognized foreign carbohydrate structure, the number and location of the carbohydrate binding sites on the protein and the degree of oligomerization.

As expected, large-scale variation in the rate of divergence between species and the variation within species across the genome, are correlated to the rate of mutation, but the correlation between divergence and the mutation rate is not as strong as it could be. We show that biased gene conversion is responsible for weakening the correlation.

The challenge is compounded by the fact that both the intrinsic dynamics of single cells and the correlations among then vary depending on the overall state of the network.

Specifically, we show how linear response theory allows for the expression of correlations explicitly in terms of the underlying network connectivity and known single-cell properties – and that the predictions of this theory accurately match simulations of a touchstone, nonlinear model in computational neuroscience, the general integrate-and-fire cell. Thus, our theory should help unlock the relationship between network architecture, single-cell dynamics, and correlated activity in diverse neural circuits.","One of the major challenges in neuroscience is to understand the architecture of neural activity networks.

Stressful environmental conditions should favor trading between species that can produce a given resource or service at the lowest cost. Mutualisms, in which both interacting species incur a net benefit, may thus strengthen under stressful conditions. Here we examine an ant–plant mutualism, in which plants provide food and housing for ants and ants defend plants against leaf-eating insects, along a four-fold annual precipitation gradient comprising tropical sites in Mexico and Central America. We show that the strength of the mutualism, in terms of carbon investment by plants and leaf defense by ants, increases as water availability decreases. Carbon shortages are more frequent where water is scarce and increase the risk that plants will die if all of their leaves are eaten by herbivores. Trees appear to invest more in ant defenders when water is scarce to insure themselves against extreme herbivory. Water availability thus indirectly determines the outcomes of this ant–plant mutualism, which suggests that the increasing frequency of extreme climate events in the tropics will have important ecological consequences.","Abiotic environmental variables are strongly affected by species interactions. Examples include mutualistic interactions between species and stronger resources are limited.

Compaction of repetitive sequences by heterochromatin is needed to prevent genome rearrangement and loss of genetic material. Furthermore, uncontrolled movement of mobile elements throughout the genome can result in deleterious mutations. In fission yeast, one important mechanism of heterochromatin establishment occurs through RNA interference, an RNA–dependent gene silencing process. However, it is unclear whether a direct role for RNA silencing in heterochromatin formation is conserved throughout evolution. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which harbors multiple RNA–silencing pathways that are both functionally distinct and spatially restricted, previous studies have suggested the involvement of the endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA) and Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways in heterochromatin formation. These small RNA silencing pathways suppress the expression of mobile elements in the soma or in both somatic and germline tissues, respectively. Utilizing complementary genetic and biochemical approaches, we monitored the heterochromatin state at discrete genomic locations from which both types of these small RNAs originate in endo-siRNA or piRNA pathway mutants. Our results indicate that heterochromatin can form independently of these two small RNA silencing pathways.","In fission yeast, heterochromatin is a highly transposable element rich region of the genome.

However, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies on the disposition of PZQ enantiomers and its main metabolite, R-trans-4-OH, in diseased patients are lacking.

Although considerable progress in genetic manipulation of Leishmania parasites have been made, it remains difficult to study molecules or metabolic pathways essential for parasite viability and growth. In the present work, we used a combination of gene deletion and conditional protein destabilization to demonstrate that biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar UDP-glucose and its derivative UDP-galactose is essential for parasite growth. Addition of a specific ligand to the culture medium of the engineered parasite protected the targeted enzyme from degradation and enabled cell growth and viability. However, removal of the stabilizing compound led to depletion of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose, growth arrest and cell death. This work thus opens a new possibility for the study of essential proteins.","Interconversion between UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) is an essential step in the cell cycle.

They are thought to be formed from abnormally folded assemblies (PrPSc) of the host-encoded prion protein (PrPC). Different PrPSc conformational variants associated with distinct biological phenotypes, or ‘strains,’ can propagate in the same host. To gain some structural information on the physical relationship between packing order (i.e. quaternary structure) and the strain-specific biological information, we previously subjected PrPSc assemblies from prion strains classified as fast or slow (according to their survival time in susceptible laboratory animals) to sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation experiments. For the fast strains specifically, the most infectious assemblies sedimented slowly and partitioned from the bulk of PrPSc macromolecular complexes. By changing the solubilization and sedimentation conditions, we established here that a small PrPSc aggregation size and not a low density accounts for these hydrodynamic properties. We further showed that these small assemblies resist proteolytic digestion and outcompete by several orders of magnitude the larger-size assemblies in cell-free prion conversion assays. Thus PrPSc quaternary structure appears to be a determining factor of prion replication dynamics.

HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and there is still no effective therapeutic strategy for non-resectable HCCs. It has been suggested that the therapeutic delivery of certain miRNA(s) has a unique advantage in clinical use. We first find that the plasma levels of miR-101 are significantly down-regulated in HCC patients with distant metastasis and associated closely with HCCs progression and/or worse disease-free survival (DFS). Next, we identify that systemic delivery of lentivirus-mediated miR-101 in an orthotopic liver implanted HCC model of mouse, not only suppresses tumor xenograft growth in the liver, but also substantially blocks intrahepatic metastasis and distant metastasis to the lung and to the mediastinum, resulting in a dramatic abrogation of HCC tumorigenesis and progression in mice without toxicity. Furthermore, functional and/or mechanistic studies of miR-101 demonstrate that miR-101 in HCC cells inhibits Rho/Rac GTPase activation, and blocks HCC cells epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis, inducing a strong abrogation of HCC tumorigenesis and aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo.","Small RNAs (sRNAs) play a key role in the development of many cancers, including breast, lung, and prostate cancers.

The proportion of each cell type varies depending on the specific needs of the organism. We know that in the mouse embryo, specialized blood progenitor cells emerge in the fetal liver and produce mature blood cells in response to different cues. However, it is difficult to distinguish between red blood cell and white blood cell-producing progenitors with sufficiently high accuracy to study these cues. For example, we know that several childhood blood disorders, such as leukemias, are caused by genetic mutations in blood progenitor cells before birth, but studying the effects of these mutations in a mouse disease model is hampered if we don’t know which blood progenitor cells to collect. We have used different genetic markers to help distinguish red blood cell, megakaryocyte and granulocyte/monocyte-producing progenitor cells with a greater precision than was previously possible. Furthermore, to illustrate how this technique can be used to study blood disorders, we demonstrated that mutations affecting the transcription factor Runx1 impair the abilities of different progenitors to produce mature blood cells in different ways.","Adult bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors are a key component of the hematopoietic system and play an important role in the development of many hematopoietic disorders.

Since October 2010, Haiti has been affected by one of the most severe cholera epidemics of the past few decades. In this report, we describe and evaluate the implementation of the original nationwide case-area targeted interventions (CATIs) response strategy, which was launched in July 2013 after years of insufficient response coordination and diminishing efforts to control cholera outbreaks in affected communities. Rapid implementation of education sessions, household decontamination, soap distribution and water chlorination in affected communities proved challenging but possible, even in a mountainous and decentralized country such as Haiti with tens of thousands of suspected cholera cases per year.

This vision was based upon cell population-based analyses averaged over millions of cells. However, new methods have recently emerged that allow interrogation of the molecular content at the single-cell level, challenging this view with a new model suggesting that cell-to-cell gene expression stochasticity could play a key role in differentiation. We took advantage of a physiologically relevant avian cellular model to analyze the expression level of 92 genes in individual cells collected at several time-points during differentiation. We first observed that the process analyzed at the single-cell level is very different and much less well ordered than the population-based average view. Furthermore, we showed that cell-to-cell variability in gene expression peaks transiently before strongly decreasing. This rise in variability precedes two key events: an irreversible commitment to differentiation, followed by a significant increase in cell size variability. Altogether, our results support the idea that differentiation is not a “simple” series of well-ordered molecular events executed identically by all cells in a population but likely results from dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.","Cell differentiation is a complex process in which cells switch from one state to another.

These reservoirs are a major barrier to curing HIV and have been studied intensively in this light. Latent reservoirs might also affect viral dynamics during untreated infection, because they provide an archive of old viral variants that can re-enter circulation at a later time upon activation of latently infected cells. We developed a mathematical model to investigate how reservoir dynamics affect the evolution of the virus within single hosts, and find that the presence of a latent reservoir can severely delay within-host evolutionary dynamics. This delay increases with the relative size of the reservoir and the rate at which latently infected cells proliferate. By nesting this within-host model into an epidemiological model of host population dynamics, we show that the presence of latent reservoirs can also influence the population-level evolution of the virus. In contrast to predictions made by previous models we find that population-level adaptation to maximise transmission between hosts, rather than within-host fitness, can occur, but only if adaptation of the virus within hosts is sufficiently slowed down by the presence of latent reservoirs.","The existence of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4 + T cells is a major barrier to curing HIV.

They cause disease by virtue of the fact that the eggs that they produce, which are intended for release from the host in order to allow transmission of infection, can become trapped in target organs such as the liver, where they induce damaging inflammation. Egg production by female schistosomes is critically dependent on the presence of male parasites, without which females never fully develop, and (counterintuitively) on the contribution of signals from the host's immune system. Very little is understood about the molecular basis of these interactions. Here, we describe a newly discovered schistosome gene, which is expressed in the reproductive tract of the female parasite and in parasite eggs. The protein encoded by this gene is made only when females are paired with males in an immunologically competent setting. Using recently developed tools that allow gene function to be inhibited in schistosomes, we show that the product of this gene plays a crucial role in egg development. Examining how the expression of this gene is controlled has the potential to provide insight into the molecular nature of the interactions between male and female parasites and their hosts. Moreover, the pivotal role of this gene in the egg makes it a potential target for blocking transmission and disease development.","Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by a parasitic worm, Schistosoma mansoni, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected person. The parasite produces eggs in the human host, which are then released into the environment to cause disease. Despite the importance of egg production in the transmission of schistosomiasis, relatively little is known about the molecular processes underlying the development of key life stage schistosomes. Here, we describe a novel parasite-encoded TGF- superfamily member, Schistosoma mansoni Inhibin/ Activin (SmInAct), which is abundantly expressed in the reproductive tissues of adult female worms.

These important pathogens have a peculiar cell cycle in which chromosomes sometimes amplify to remarkable levels, followed by concerted cell division—providing an unusual proliferative capacity. This capacity for proliferation, combined with an ability to change the scale of replication when needed, are hallmarks of the cell cycles of these parasites. Yet the molecular mechanism responsible for these peculiar cell cycles remains one of the unsolved mysteries of Apicomplexa biology. Here we show that the centrosome—an organelle that orchestrates several aspects of the cell cycle—of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii contains specialized structures that coordinate parasite cell division. Our findings demonstrate that a two-part centrosomal architecture, comprising an inner and an outer core with distinct protein compositions, segregates the processes of mitosis from the assembly of new daughter parasites. The modular organization of the centrosome offers an explanation for how cell division can be suspended while the parasites amplify their genome to the biotic scale required for their life cycles. It is unknown whether these distinct centrosome core complexes evolved independently in Apicompexa. Another possibility is that the foundations for these mechanisms were present in the original eukaryote, which could explain how the distinct extranuclear centrosome of animal cells and the novel yeast spindle pole body of the nuclear envelope may have evolved from a common ancestor.","Apicomplexan parasites change fundamental features of cell division life cycles and, suspending cytokinesis, are needed changing the scale of different hosts tissues.

We have analyzed the behavior of two orphan, atypical response regulators that play key roles in controlling morphological differentiation in the filamentous bacteria Streptomyces-BldM and WhiI. We demonstrate that BldM activates its Group I target promoters as a homodimer, but that it subsequently activates its Group II target promoters by forming a functional heterodimer with WhiI. BldM-WhiI heterodimer formation thus represents an unusual mechanism for the coactivation of target genes and the integration of regulatory signals at promoters, enhancing the known repertoire of signaling capabilities associated with two-component systems.","BldM is an orphan response regulator that plays a critical role in Streptomyces differentiation.

As a testament to this safety and efficacy, the 17D line of live-attenuated vaccines has become an important model for the design of future vaccines. However, we still lack a fundamental understanding of the protective immunity elicited against the virulent YFV, a knowledge gap that must be overcome to inform the design of future live-attenuated and subunit vaccines. Humans develop robust antibody and T cell responses following vaccination, leading some to suggest that vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells are important for protection against virulent YFV. Since this can never be tested in humans, we have used mice to model immunity to the 17D-204 vaccine strain. We found that CD4+ T cells elicited by 17D-204 contributed to protection against virulent YFV, but CD8+ T cells had no effect on the outcomes of survival or disease.

The infection occurs mainly in developing countries and is associated with poverty, poor sanitation and free-range pig management. It is estimated to be responsible for 30% of cases of acquired epilepsy in endemic areas. The limited number of human studies on this infection in Sub-Saharan Africa determined a high occurrence of cysticercosis. This study aimed to learn more about the transmission dynamics of this parasite in a rural endemic area in Eastern Zambia. A longitudinal study was carried out in which 867 participants were blood sampled three times, with a 6-month interval. Samples were analysed for the presence of cysticercal circulating antigens and specific antibodies. Results indicate that about 1 on 3 people get exposed to infection while only 1 on 10 people actually acquire infection. The study shows the dynamic nature of T. solium infections; many of the people at risk become (re)infected due to the high environmental contamination, with a high number turning seronegative within a year after infection.

The polymorphism is driven by coevolution with parasites which are selected to evade recognition by MHC proteins. Expressing many MHC molecules could ensure that an individual could present antigens of most pathogen species encountered, but this comes at a cost, such as enhanced negative selection on lymphocytes leading to holes in T-cell receptor repertoire. Our simulations showed that evolution of the number of MHC genes in the genome is driven by a complex interaction between three factors we explored: pathogen richness, the intrinsic cost of expressing additional MHC variants, and pathogen mutation rate. In contrast to verbal arguments, our results indicate that pathogen richness does not always selects for MHC gene family expansion. Taking into account factors other than pathogen richness, in particular costs of expressing additional MHC variants which are still poorly understood, may help explain striking interspecific variation in the number of MHC genes. Counterintuitively, our results also demonstrated that opportunity for selection on immunocompetence should decrease with MHC gene family expansion.","MHC genes, code proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, are remarkable copy-number variation species.

However, the genetic variants discovered from GWAS only explained a small fraction of the heritability, resulting in the question of “missing heritability”. We have recently developed approaches (called GREML) to estimate the overall contribution of all SNPs to the phenotypic variance of a trait (disease) and the proportion of genetic overlap between traits (diseases). A frequently asked question is that how many samples are required to estimate the proportion of variance attributable to all SNPs and the proportion of genetic overlap with useful precision. In this study, we derive the standard errors of the estimated parameters from theory and find that they are highly consistent with those observed values from published results and those obtained from simulation. The theory together with an online application tool will be helpful to plan experimental design to quantify the missing heritability, and to estimate the genetic overlap between traits (diseases) especially when it is unfeasible to have the traits (diseases) measured on the same individuals.","Genetic correlations between complex traits and diseases can be measured by the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data from unrelated individuals.

The first step in anthrax intoxication involves binding of the toxin to a specific protein, called a receptor, on the cell surface. Receptor-binding acts like a switch to prevent the toxin from forming a pore in a cell membrane until the toxin-receptor complex is taken up into cells and delivered to a specific location (called an endosome) where it is exposed to an “acid bath”. This acidic environment promotes structural changes in the toxin leading to pore formation in the endosomal membrane. In this report, we have studied how the receptor regulates pore formation by following the associated changes in toxin-receptor contacts. These studies have defined a new toxin-receptor intermediate in the pathway leading to pore conversion and demonstrate that the receptor remains bound after pore conversion. Our results provide important new insights into how the receptor regulates anthrax toxin pore formation, information that could be useful for designing new therapeutic strategies to treat this disease.","ANTXR2, an anthrax toxin receptor-based switch, binds domains 2 and 4 of the protective antigen (PA) toxin subunit to restrict structural changes in the heptameric PA prepore required for pore conversion to acidic endosomal compartment.

More research is needed to understand the diverse immune responses against Mtb to develop better vaccines. Mouse Qa-1 and its human counterpart HLA-E are nonclassical MHC I molecules that can activate or inhibit immune responses in a variety of diseases. However, their role during the immune response to Mtb remains unknown. We found that Qa-1 can present Mtb peptides to activate CD8+ T effector cells during aerosol Mtb infection. Further, Mtb-infected mice that lacked Qa-1 (Qa-1-/-) had higher numbers of bacteria and died more often than infected mice that expressed Qa-1 (Qa-1+/+). The lack of Qa-1 results in over-activation of the immune response upon infection, which is less efficient in controlling Mtb. Using mice expressing different mutant forms of Qa-1, we showed that Qa-1 can regulate immune responses against Mtb through the interaction with inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptors as well as the activation of regulatory CD8+ T cells. We believe our study sheds light on the diverse mechanisms at play in generating protective immune responses against Mtb and will inform future mouse and human studies.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a bacterial pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB) in humans.

To help predict future virus emergences, we developed a model that estimates simultaneously genetic drift and selection intensities using high-throughput sequence data representing the within-host population dynamics of Potato virus Y variants differing at most by two substitutions involved in pathogenicity properties. The competitiveness costs induced by these mutations as well as the mathematical expressions of the competition coefficients of virus variants were derived from Lotka–Volterra equations. High genetic differentiation of virus populations between hosts was evidenced as well as its hump-shaped behaviour with time. The modelling framework proposed here was intended to help design control strategies aiming to prevent virus emergences.","Understanding the dynamics of genetic drift is important for understanding the evolution of viruses.

Gene duplication and amplification (GDA) represents a simple and effective means to augment protein expression and is frequently associated with the development of resistance against antibacterial agents. As such GDAs can be seen as recent evolutionary adaptions towards novel selective pressures within the environment. We describe herein the GDA of the isd locus in a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus lugdunensis a bacterial species frequently associated with infectious endocarditis. This amplification made individual lineages significantly more successful when competing for the trace element iron supplied in the form of hemoglobin (hb). Human body fluids are actively depleted of iron to prevent bacterial proliferation and hb represents the most abundant iron source during infection. This deepens our understanding about adaption processes of pathogens and demonstrates how selective pressures drive the evolution of pathogens to become more successful. This study suggests that investigating GDAs in clinical isolates can help to identify chromosomal regions that are of special importance for bacterial fitness under changing environmental conditions. The gene products can therefore represent attractive targets for novel antibiotics supporting the natural immune defenses by targeting the vulnerable spots of the bacterial anti-immunity strategies.,"Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative bacterial pathogen that is particularly associated with severe cases of infectious endocarditis.

These bacteria can rapidly spread through a population through a process of cytoplasmic incompatibility whereby females uninfected by Wolbachia show embryo death when they mate with males carrying the bacteria. Because the infected females pass on Wolbachia to their offspring, this places them at a reproductive advantage, ensuring that the infection spreads through insect populations once it reaches a high enough frequency to overcome any negative fitness effects on its host. Yet while such a rapid spread has been predicted, it has rarely been observed in nature. Here we show that a Wolbachia infection of Drosophila simulans flies has spread very rapidly in eastern Australia, replacing another Wolbachia infection that has also spread in recent years. These invasions appear to have taken place from a very low frequency, implying that both infections are likely to have had a benefit to their hosts rather than a cost.

It is most feared because of its tendency to spread rapidly resulting in deaths in a short time, if appropriate treatment is not provided. For fear of trade and travel sanctions, countries were disinclined to report cholera, unless large outbreaks ensued. Although countries in Asia have been reporting cholera, it is believed that more cases are not being identified and instead being reported as acute watery diarrhea. Cholera is endemic in the Philippines however data on cholera in the country remained sparse, until 2008 when surveillance was strengthened. From 2008 to 2013, 42,071 suspected and confirmed cholera cases were reported in 87% of provinces and metropolitan areas in the country, confirming the endemicity of cholera in the Philippines. Poor access to improved sanitation was associated with cholera. On the other hand despite access to improved water sources, cholera remains to be seen. The latter is most probably due to the breakdown and non-chlorination of water systems. We identified areas where cholera has been known to occur in the Philippines, this will assist in the development and implementation of policies to minimize the morbidity and mortality due to this disease.","Cholera is the leading cause of death in the Philippines, affecting more than 100,000 people each year.

Since diet is known to influence the rate of aging, animals seem to have evolved intricate mechanisms to maintain homeostasis and normal life span, but the molecular mechanisms are less understood. Using a small nematode, C. elegans as a model, we show that the adaptive capacity to different diet is maintained by a kinase gene. When this gene is mutated, worms start living longer on one strain of bacterial diet but not on the other. We identify the molecular cascade required for this food-type-dependent longevity. We show that this cascade of events significantly overlaps with the pathway that determine food quantity-dependent life span enhancement. Our study thus elucidates a part of the molecular monitoring system that regulates longevity dependent on the available quality and quantity of diet.","Diet profoundly affects metabolism incidences of age-related diseases such as diabetes and obesity.

In the environment, L. pneumophila survives and replicates within protozoa by co-opting the intracellular machinery of these microbial predators. These freshwater encounters between bacteria and protozoa likely provided L. pneumophila with the selective pressures required to evolve into an intracellular pathogen. Many of the host pathways that L. pneumophila manipulates during infection are highly conserved and this is presumably what allows L. pneumophila to infect human cells. It is likely that L. pneumophila is suboptimally adapted to replication within mammalian cells, however, as replication within human cells is thought to be an evolutionary dead end. In this study, we developed an experimental evolution approach to determine what unique selective pressures might be present within mammalian hosts and how these pressures might modify this pathogen. We subjected L. pneumophila to continuous passage within mouse macrophages for several months, selecting for spontaneous mutations that resulted in improved fitness within these cells. We sequenced the genomes of each of the adapted strains, measured the population dynamics of each evolving population, and identified mutations that improve replication in mammalian cells and alter bacterial fitness in amoebae.",Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium that is accidental intracellular pathogen in humans.

The collection of BV prevalence may therefore also be important.Developing new cohorts for dedicated STI/BV prevalence studies may not be realistic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the impact of STIs/BV and their consequences may be greatest.Nesting STI/BV surveys within networks of health and demographic surveillance sites (HDSSs) would be an efficient way of providing data to better understand STI epidemiology among adolescents and young people in high HIV prevalence settings.We carried out a nested STI/BV survey among 1,342 adolescent and young people in an HDSS in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between October 2016 and January 2017.Potential participants were contacted at home and invited to participate.Participants were interviewed, and samples were collected for STI/BV testing.We showed that this study was feasible within the 3.5-month time period: 1,171/1,342 (87%) individuals had ≥1 attempted home visit, of whom 790 (67%) were successfully contacted.The study was acceptable: among those contacted and eligible, 447/645 (69%) enrolled. Both men and women reported few problems with sample collection.We report a high burden of STIs/BV in this population, particularly of chlamydia (5% in men and 11% in women), herpes simplex virus type 2 (17% in men and 29% in women), and BV (42% in women).Nested STI/BV surveys in HDSSs can be feasible and acceptable; however, more survey time is needed to ensure that all potential participants are visited and contacted.These studies should be carried out in conjunction with studies to measure STI/BV prevalence in high-risk populations (e.g., female sex workers) to provide robust prevalence estimates.These data are essential to advocate, fund, plan, implement, and evaluate interventions for STI prevention and control among adolescents and young people.Strategies for the prevention and control of chlamydia, herpes simplex virus type 2, and BV are needed in this population.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) are associated with increased transmission of HIV, poor reproductive sexual health, and the burden of these infections on young people is unknown in high HIV prevalence settings.

Toward this end, we have developed a different approach, using a mouse model that accelerates the differentiation of the newly generated neurons without altering their number, and offers the possibility to induce the process at any chosen moment. We show that the new neurons pass through their early stages of maturation faster and, though establishing connections with the existing neuronal circuits, fail to function properly. In fact, mice are not only unable to learn new spatial information, but they are also unable to use previously acquired memories. These results demonstrate that the appropriate timing of maturation of new neurons is important for their adult performance in memory circuits, i.e., to integrate new memory traces and recall previous events.","Adult-generated dentate gyrus neurons play a critical role in learning and memory in the hippocampal brain.

Photosynthetic membranes in chloroplasts contain high levels of glycolipids, and UDP-galactose is a dominating donor for glycolipid biosynthesis. Although glycolipid assembly of photosynthetic membranes has been characterized at the genetic and enzymatic level, the mechanism of substrate supply of UDP-galactose for the glycolipid biosynthetic pathway remains obscure. By genetic screening of rice mutants that are impaired in photosynthetic capacity and carbon assimilation, we identified PHD1 as a novel nucleotide sugar epimerase involved in a process of glycolipid biosynthesis and participating in photosynthetic membrane biogenesis. PHD1 was preferentially expressed in green and meristem tissues, and the PHD1 protein was targeted to chloroplasts. We revealed that UDP-galactose for glycolipid biosynthesis catalyzed by the new enzyme was generated inside chloroplasts, and the reduced amounts of glycolipids in the mutant led to decreased chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity. Overexpression of this gene lead to growth acceleration, enhanced photosynthetic efficiency, and finally improved biomass and grain yield in rice.

Therefore, we generated mutants for all 7 dilp genes and systematically analyzed their phenotypes. We show that loss of DILP2 extends lifespan and describe a novel role for DILP6 in growth control. Furthermore, we show that DILPs are evolutionary conserved and can act redundantly, supporting the hypothesis that functional redundancy itself can be of evolutionary advantage. We also describe a specific interaction between IIS and the endosymbiontic bacterium Wolbachia in lifespan regulation. This finding has implications for all longevity studies using IIS mutants in flies and offers the opportunity to study IIS as a mechanism involved in host/symbiont interactions. Finally, we show that DILPs mediate the response of lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction.","The insulin-like peptide (IGF) signaling pathway plays a key role in growth, metabolism, stress resistance, reproduction, and longevity in diverse organisms including mammals. Invertebrate genomes contain multiple genes encoding insulin-like peptides (ILPs), including seven Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs). We investigated the evolution, diversification, redundancy, and function of DILPs, using complete genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species and functional analysis, based on newly-generated knock-out mutations in 7 DILP genes D. melanogaster. We found that diversification of DILPs preceded diversification of the Drosophila species, stable gene diversification family membership, and stable gene redundancy. Loss of DILPs produced the brain greatly extended presence of the endosymbiontic bacterium Wolbachia, demonstrating a specific interaction between Wolbachia regulation and DILPs.

Here, we utilize the vast repository of breast cancer data that is available in the public domain, and which contains a rich resource for DNA methylation and clinical data on breast cancer patients.

This integrative approach supports the claim that DNA methylation profiling of patient tumors in the clinic may contain valuable information that can guide the development of treatment regimens for individual patients; thus contributing to the progression of precision medicine.","Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women worldwide.

In this report, we use a high-throughput genetic approach to comprehensively identify nearly all genetic loci that promote resistance to the beta-lactam mecillinam in the model organism Escherichia coli. Moreover, by performing our analysis in several different genetic backgrounds we were able to generate a rich resource that defines those alleles that promote resistance by inducing a stress response and those that are more likely to do so by directly modulating cell wall synthesis.

Hence, it is important to understand the different mechanisms underlying gain modulation. Earlier work focused on gain modulation in mature networks with functional connectivity; however, the mechanisms of gain control in the developing brain are still unclear. We show here that asynchronous release of neurotransmitter, a form of synaptic “noise” that is strongly expressed in synapses of the developing brain, and short-term synaptic plasticity can efficiently modulate the gain of the synapse without a priori assumptions about network's connectivity. Asynchronous release depends on the activity-dependent accumulation of synaptic calcium. We show that changes in asynchronous release can have either a divisive or multiplicative effect on the gain, depending on the state of the neuronal membrane conductance. Thus, activity-dependent synaptic “noise” can regulate the information flow at synapses, and its impact on the neuron is flexibly modulated by neuronal membrane conductance.","The ability of neurons to modulate their sensitivity depends on how they receive information from the outside world.

There are numerous mechanisms within the cell, collectively referred to as protein quality control (PQC), that verify proper folding. If abnormal folding is detected, PQC can either help the protein to refold or target it for degradation. Failures in protein folding and PQC lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which often self-associate into large aggregations that are thought to be the underlying cause of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we use the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to understand how cells handle disease-associated misfolded proteins. In a large-scale genetic screen, we discovered two suppressor genes, ufd-2 and spr-5, which encode a ubiquitin ligase and a lysine-specific demethylase, respectively. When these two proteins are inactivated, we observe a marked reduction in the toxicity of several misfolded proteins. ufd-2 and spr-5 are conserved in humans (UBE4B and LSD1, respectively), as are their effects on misfolded proteins. We show that UBE4B and LSD1 regulate the activity of protein degradation machineries including the proteasome and autophagosomes. Using microarrays and biochemical analyses, we identify p53 as a key downstream transcription factor that mediates the action of UBE4B and LSD1 on protein clearance. This work establishes p53 as a regulator of proteome integrity and uncovers a new protein quality control pathway that could potentially be exploited to increase the degradation of misfolded proteins in diseased cells.","Protein quality control is essential for clearing misfolded aggregated proteins from the cell, failure associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

For proper function, a protein complex should facilitate transduction between the interacting proteins. Therefore the complex’s dynamics should reveal whether it is obligatory or non-obligatory. Indeed, normal mode analysis shows that the dynamic domains of obligatory complexes often mix segments from the interacting chains. In contrast, in non-obligatory complexes the inter-chain interface often hinges between dynamic domains, held together through few anchor residues. An automated methodology based on these observations correctly classifies over 80% of the interfaces in a test set.

C. albicans has the ability to form different types of biofilms under different environmental conditions. Here, we compare the regulation of biofilm formation in conventional biofilms, for which a core transcriptional network has recently been identified, with pheromone-stimulated biofilms, which occur when C. albicans white cells are exposed to pheromone. Our studies show that several regulatory components control biofilm formation under both conditions, including the network transcriptional regulators Bcr1, Brg1, Rob1, and Tec1.

In this work, we show that many of the mitochondrial genes in trypanosomes are dual-coding, utilizing different reading frames to potentially produce two very different proteins. Access to both reading frames is made possible by alternative editing of the 5’ end of the transcript. We hypothesize that dual-coding genes may work to protect the mitochondrial genes from mutations during growth in the mammalian host, when many of the mitochondrial genes are not being used.

Our study provides a solid basis for further investigation of the gene, which may help to reveal the underlying mechanisms for the timing of menarche and for AAM's relationship with women's health in general.","The age of menarche (AAM) is one of the most important physiological events in women and is associated with major complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified a novel gene, SPOCK (Sparc / Osteonectin, CWCV, Kazal-like domains proteoglycan), which is associated with AAM variation in Caucasian and Chinese women. We performed a follow-up study to validate the major GWAS findings in independent Caucasian and Chinese cohorts, and found that SPOCK was associated with AAM variation in Caucasian and Chinese women. We also found that SPOCK inhibited activation of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a key factor promoting menstrual breakdown and onset of endometrial bleeding.",17.200373134328363

Cysteine proteases from Leishmania are important virulence factors and, therefore, interesting drug targets. Studies on inhibitors against these enzymes during Leishmania major infection in mice had shown that host equivalents of these proteases are also affected, namely cathepsin B and cathepsin L. The inhibition of cathepsin B resulted in immune-mediated protection, while inhibition of cathepsin L caused susceptibility to the parasite. In the present study, we investigated the effect of cathepsin deficiency on the signals used by dendritic cells to orchestrate the T helper (Th)-mediated immune response against L. major and the control of parasite proliferation within infected macrophages. The results demonstrate that cathepsin B-deficient dendritic cells express higher levels of the antigen-presenting MHC class II molecules than WT and cathepsin L-deficient cells. Surprisingly, dendritic cells and macrophages deficient for cathepsin B showed higher expression of the protective Th1-inducing cytokine IL-12. Therefore, we propose a novel role of this protease as a regulator of cytokine expression. Altogether, these findings suggest that cathepsin B down-regulates the Th1 response to L. major, and, in its absence, antigen-presenting cells express signals protecting against the parasite.","Leishmania is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Infection with this bacterium can lead to severe disease in humans.

In this study, we investigated the role of the cathepsin B (Ctsb) and L (Ctsl) in Th1 and Th2 polarization in a mouse model of Leishmania infection. We found that Ctsb and L (Ctsl) deficiency in bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDC) and Ctsb/ Ctsl/ mice were associated with higher levels of MHC class II co-stimulatory molecules, cytokine production, and survival.

We hypothesised that if students know the fundamental concepts of genetics, then this might help them understand evolution better. To evaluate this, we performed a large trial in which pupils in United Kingdom secondary schools were either taught genetics and then evolution or evolution and then genetics. We found that the students being taught genetics first had a 5%–10% improvement in their understanding of evolution, above that shown in the group taught evolution first. The change was seen in both higher- and foundation-ability classes.

Chikungunya and West Nile viruses (WNV), both mosquito-borne RNA viruses, are quintessential examples of how increased globalization has facilitated the expansion of viruses into new territories. Rapid evolution of both of these agents has contributed to their rapid spread and health burden. Thus, characterizing how selection shapes zoonotic RNA viruses in their natural hosts is important to understand their emergence.

In this study, we analyzed 4,302 tumors from 18 cancer types and demonstrated that driver gene mutations are inherently connected with the aberrant DNA methylation landscape in cancer. We showed that driver gene–associated methylation patterns can classify heterogeneous tumors within a cancer type into homogeneous subtypes and have the potential to influence genes that contribute to tumor growth.

In fact, a careful balance between excitation and inhibition is required for the brain to operate in a sustained state, away from both epileptic activity (which would arise if excitation dominated over inhibition) and complete quiescence (which would emerge if inhibition prevailed). While much work has been devoted to study how excitation and inhibition are organized at the level of neural microcircuits, little is known about how these two effects are structured at larger scales. Here we are interested in the scale of cortical macrocolumns, large collectives of neurons that can be described computationally by population models known as neural mass models. These models are routinely used to describe the brain rhythms observed with non-invasive techniques such as EEG. In this paper we show, using a neural mass model, that a collection of coupled cortical macrocolumns self-organizes spontaneously into a dynamical state in which excitation and inhibition are segregated at the mesoscopic level, with some cortical columns (the most connected ones) being inhibitory, and the rest being excitatory.","Neurons are known to operate in a careful balance of inhibition, maintaining proper neural microcircuits in their operational range.

Intriguingly, we found that such a DNA transfer machinery closely related to the host-targeting secretion system of Bartonella has recruited a bacterial protein involved in modulating DNA topology as an interbacterial effector protein that is translocated together with the DNA into recipient cells. The overall setup of this interbacterial effector is remarkably similar to the host-targeted effectors of Bartonella, and we propose that it represents an evolutionary missing link on the path from a genuine bacterial protein to effectors that manipulates host cell functioning.

Myosin cross-bridge binding is regulated by Ca2+ and the thin filament proteins troponin and tropomyosin. Cooperative interactions between actin, myosin, troponin, and tropomyosin greatly influence spatial and kinetic properties of thin filament activation, thereby affecting muscle mechanics and contractility. Such cooperative interactions are complex and individual contributions from the different contractile and regulatory proteins are difficult to separate experimentally. However, a few theoretical models have explored interactions between the spatial, kinetic, and mechanical processes that affect cooperative cross-bridge binding to actin. Building on our prior spatially-explicit computational models, we investigated the relative contributions of thin filament regulatory proteins and cross-bridges to cooperatively amplify skeletal muscle force production. We find that Ca2+-dependent contraction in skeletal muscle is dominated by neighboring regulatory protein interactions along the thin filament, while cross-bridge binding is critical for maintaining or stabilizing thin filament activation as force develops. Moreover, we reveal that variations in filament and cross-bridge stiffness can alter Ca2+-sensitivity and cooperativity of skeletal muscle force production. In conclusion, these simulations show that multiple cooperative mechanisms combine to produce physiological force responses measured from muscle cells.","Striated muscle contraction is a highly cooperative process initiated by Ca2 + binding troponin complex, which leads to tropomyosin movement myosin cross-bridge (XB) formation of thin filaments. Experimental computational studies suggest skeletal muscle fiber activation greatly augmented cooperative interactions between thin filament regulatory units (RU-RU cooperativity; 1 RU = 7 actin; 1 RU = 7 actin+1 tropomyosin molecule) and the troponin+1 complex (tropomyosin molecule). XB binding amplifies thin filament activation interactions between RUs (XB-RU cooperativity; 1 RU = 7 actin; 1 RU = 7 actin+1 tropomyosin molecule) and the troponin+1 complex (tropomyosin molecule). However, previous spatially explicit models illustrated mechanical forms of cooperativity exist, arising from XB-induced XB binding (XB-XB cooperativity). In this study, we build a multi- filament model of half sarcomere, allowing RU activation kinetics to vary state. Simulations suggest that kinetic forms of cooperativity occur rapidly and that mechanical forms of cooperativity act slowly, allowing RU activation kinetics to vary state.",16.533406593406593

One can expect to gain power for detecting such variants by including relevant covariates in the analysis, by accounting for any relatedness of sampled individuals, and by making use of partial information in the data. For analysis of continuously-varying traits, variations on linear mixed-model (LMM) approaches have proven effective at achieving some of these goals. However, for case-control or binary trait mapping, there remain significant challenges. Direct application of LMM approaches to binary traits suffers from power loss when covariate effects are strong, and existing generalized LMM approaches can perform poorly in the presence of trait model misspecification and partially missing data. We propose CERAMIC, a method for binary trait mapping, which is computationally feasible for large genome-wide studies, and which gains power over previous approaches by improved trait modeling, retrospective assessment of significance, accounting for sample structure, and making use of partially missing data. We illustrate this approach in genome-wide association mapping of type 2 diabetes in data from the Framingham Heart Study.","Genetic association testing is an important step in understanding the genetic basis of disease. However, it is often difficult to identify the genetic basis of disease because of the large number of missing data.

We show that this approach, called CERAMIC, is more efficient than existing LMM generalized linear mixed-effects models. We also show that this approach can be applied to genomewide analysis of samples of related individuals, including small families, unrelated individuals, and large, complex pedigrees.",14.849571428571426

However, in the past several years, research has revealed the existence of an additional line of host defense against HIV/SIV. It is now apparent that cells contain factors (also known as cellular restrictions) that potently inhibit virus infection. This has forced primate lentiviruses to evolve a strategy to counteract these cellular restriction factors. For example, HIV/SIV encode an accessory protein called Vif, whose function is to neutralize a cellular restriction to HIV/SIV infection. Our study provides evidence for a novel restriction that is expressed by macrophages and which potently antagonizes HIV and SIV infection. We describe how the virus protects itself from this cellular restriction.

Parthenogenesis represents a specific mode of asexual reproduction, secondarily derived from sexual reproduction, and refers to the development of a multicellular organism from an unfertilised gamete. Parthenogenesis has evolved independently in a wide variety of groups, but the genetic basis and the evolutionary forces driving transitions from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction remain elusive. Here, we explore genetic, genomic and transcriptomic data from the brown alga Ectocarpus to uncover the genetic architecture of parthenogenesis. The brown algae are a group of complex multicellular organisms that have been evolving independently from animals and plants for more than a billion years, and they have recently emerged as important models to study the evolution of reproductive modes. We show that parthenogenesis is a complex genetic trait under the control of the sex locus, together with two additional autosomal quantitative trait loci, highlighting the critical role for the sex chromosomes in the control of asexual reproduction in this organism. We identify several negative effects of parthenogenesis on male fitness and reveal evidence for trade-offs between sexual and asexual reproduction during the life cycle of Ectocarpus. Our results support the idea that parthenogenesis may be under both sex-specific selection and generation/ploidally-antagonistic selection, but the action of fluctuating selection on this trait may also contribute to the maintenance of polymorphisms in populations.","Sexual asexual reproduction is one of the most frequent evolutionary transitions in eukaryotes, and the genetic basis of this transition remains largely elusive.

Releases of genetically sterile males have been shown to reduce wild mosquito numbers. An alternative approach is to release mosquitoes carrying genes blocking dengue transmission. It is often assumed that spreading such genes in mosquito populations requires using selfish genetic elements (SGEs - genes that are inherited at higher rates than other genes in the genome). Absent such techniques, the release numbers required to transform mosquito populations is seen as prohibitive. However, strategies that rely on SGEs or related technologies to spread anti-dengue genes are unlikely to be implemented in the near future as a public health response. Using a biologically detailed model of Aedes aegypti populations dynamics and genetics, we assess how many mosquitoes need to be released to spread an anti-pathogen gene in an urban environment without using an SGE. We compare release numbers with two other, currently feasible transgenic strategies: releasing mosquitoes with female-lethal genes, and mosquitoes carrying both female-lethal and anti-pathogen genes. We show that even without using SGEs, releasing mosquitoes in numbers much smaller than those considered necessary for transgenic population reduction can effectively reduce the ability of Aedes aegypti to spread dengue.","Introgressing anti-pathogen constructs in wild vector populations reduce disease transmission.

How metabolic organs and organelles adapt to nutritional fluctuations, or fail to do so, remains incompletely understood. To explore these issues, we developed a new platform to explore translational responses in the liver, a critical organ for metabolic homeostasis. In this translatomic platform, we integrated polysome profiling and global analysis of polysome-associated mRNAs to systematically quantify protein synthesis on each transcript in obesity and during fasting. Our analysis demonstrated for the first time that protein synthesis is progressively suppressed in the obese liver and that the overall translatome profile of obese liver markedly resembles that of fasting lean mice, particularly in mitochondrial function and bile metabolism. We also examined the physiological impact of some of these alterations and concluded that aberrant bile acid metabolism in the obese liver represents a novel mechanism contributing to hyperglycemia and continuous weight gain. Together, our work reveals abnormal translational regulation as a novel aspect of obesity that could impact future directions in metabolic disease treatment, and we believe translatome profiling represents a new approach to unravel complex mechanisms regulating cellular function and disease pathology.","Obesity-associated metabolic complications are generally considered to be abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism, status protein metabolism, and lipid metabolism.

The selected location is often determined by the bottom-up visual inputs rather than the top-down intentions. For example, a red dot among green ones automatically attracts attention and is said to be salient. Physiological data have suggested that the primary visual cortex (V1) in the brain contributes to creating such bottom-up saliencies from visual inputs, but indicated little on whether V1 plays an essential or peripheral role in creating a saliency map of the input space to guide attention. Traditional psychological frameworks, based mainly on behavioral data, have implicated higher-level brain areas for the saliency map. Recently, it has been hypothesized that V1 creates this saliency map, such that the image location whose visual input evokes the highest response among all V1 output neurons is most likely selected from a visual scene for attentional processing. This paper derives nontrivial predictions from this hypothesis and presents their psychophysical tests and confirmations. Our findings suggest that bottom-up saliency is computed at a lower brain area than previously expected, and have implications on top-down attentional mechanisms.","The primary visual cortex (V1) is a region of the brain that plays a central role in the processing of visual information.

If only one of the DSB ends shares homology with another region, repair proceeds via break-induced replication (BIR), which, unlike GC, can lead to nonreciprocal translocations. We previously showed that a Recombination Execution Checkpoint (REC) delays BIR thereby preventing it from acting on breaks that can be repaired by GC. Here, we induced two DSBs such that only one end from each break shares homology with an ectopic donor so that although repair can proceed via GC, it will result in DNA rearrangement. We asked whether REC would inhibit GC-mediated repair in this scenario. We found that REC does not restrict such repair; however, repair by GC is faster when both ends are derived from a single DSB. We suggest that the DSB ends engage in a coordinated search for homology that favors both ends engaging the same donor, thus avoiding complex chromosomal rearrangements. Moreover, when the two ends of a DSB share homology with different loci, recombination of one end with its partner impedes repair of the other end.","DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical for maintaining genome stability. The repair of DSBs is critical for maintaining genome stability. However, the repair of DSBs is not always efficient.

Among these studies, the potential protective effect of some helminth species on malaria severity has attracted considerable attention because of the possible public health impact. However, despite the fact that helminth species frequently co-occur together within an individual, no studies have investigated the role of within-host helminth community interactions on malaria severity. Taking the advantage of a cohort study in Thailand, we found that infection by Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura were both associated with direct reductions in cerebral malaria risk. However, the benefit of T. trichiura infection was halved in the presence of hookworm, revealing that interactions among helminth species can jeopardize the beneficial role of individual helminths. Our study shows that the outcome of interactions between two parasite species can be significantly modified by a third, emphasizing the critical role that parasite community interactions play in shaping infection outcomes and their impact on public health. These insights are especially relevant for neglected tropical diseases that occur in areas of high pathogen diversity.","Plasmodium falciparum and Ascaris lumbricoides Trichuris trichiura are two species of helminths that cause cerebral malaria in humans.

This low diversity could result from neutral processes, for example, if there are fewer males successfully mating (and thus fewer Y chromosomes being inherited) relative to the number of females who successfully mate. Alternatively, natural selection may act on mutations on the Y chromosome to reduce genetic diversity. Because there is no recombination across most of the Y chromosome all sites on the Y are effectively linked together. Thus, selection acting on any one site will affect all sites on the Y indirectly. Here, studying the X, Y, autosomal and mitochondrial DNA, in combination with population genetic simulations, we show that low observed Y chromosome variability is consistent with models of purifying selection removing deleterious mutations and linked variation, although positive selection may also be acting. We further infer that the number of sites affected by selection likely includes some proportion of the highly repetitive ampliconic regions on the Y. Because the functional significance of the ampliconic regions is poorly understood, our findings should motivate future research in this area.","The human Y chromosome exhibits surprisingly low levels of genetic diversity.

These antibodies target a variety of sites on the envelope protein of HIV, three copies of which associate to form a trimer that decorate the membrane surface of the virus particle. Some of these antibodies target regions of the envelope protein close to the membrane, some bind to the top of the trimer, others bind via carbohydrates which cover the envelope protein and another subset binds to the same site as the human HIV receptor CD4. Despite effectively blocking 50% of infection at low antibody concentrations, for some particular virus/antibody combinations a proportion of virus particles are resistant to antibody neutralization, even at extremely high concentrations. This phenomenon is called incomplete neutralization and also frequently results in non-sigmoidal dose-response curves when antibody concentration is plotted against the level of virus infection. Previously, antibodies that target the apex of the trimer have been associated with incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal curves. In this study we show that representatives from all the groups of antibodies described above result in incomplete neutralization against at least one virus but that the phenomenon is more frequent for those binding the apex and the stalk of the trimer. Resistant populations of virus were seen whether the virus was produced in the natural target of HIV infection (human CD4+ T cells) or engineered human cells more commonly used to produce virus to test antibody function. Understanding this phenomenon is important for the future use of antibodies as therapeutics and for vaccine studies as a resistant population of viruses could result in failure to control the virus infection in patients.","The neutralization profile of HIV antibodies (bnMAbs) has been shown to be non-sigm slope plateaus  100 %.

These parasites typically have complex life cycles involving multiple hosts and some, like Toxoplasma gondii, have the ability to remain in the host for life as a latent tissue cyst. Toxoplasma is one of the most successful parasites on Earth because the ability to develop into a tissue cyst greatly facilitates transmission through carnivores. Cyst formation also is responsible for recrudescent infection in immunocompromised patients. The conversion of Toxoplasma from its replicating cell to the cyst is triggered by stress, but we have little understanding of how the parasite stress response functions. In this study, we identify the genes involved in Toxoplasma's response to alkaline stress, which is a known trigger of cyst development. We also establish that a lysine acetyltransferase enzyme called TgGCN5-A is required for type I RH strain Toxoplasma to respond normally to alkaline stress.

They are able to autonomously change position and proliferate in chromosomes. The nature of the coevolutionary dynamics of IS with the genome that hosts them is a matter of debate: Do IS proliferate to the point of causing the extinction of the host? Is it possible that IS and hosts stably coexist? Can environmental perturbations cause IS expansions? What is the role of selection in controlling IS copy number? In this study, we have analysed abundance patterns of IS families to test two different evolutionary hypotheses: in the first one IS evolve neutrally, while in the second case they are affected by selection. Our results indicate that, most of the time, IS and their hosts coexist stably in a neutral scenario where the proliferation of IS through duplications and lateral gene transfer is balanced by regular deletions. Occasionally, though, this balance may be disrupted, causing temporary explosions of IS abundance.","Bacterial genomes are the most abundant form of transposable DNA found in the world.

Here, we use large genomic data from 33 families of bacterial chromosomes to study the roles of duplication, lateral gene transfer, deletion, and purifying selection in determining the content of bacterial genomes. We find that in cases driven by selection, the neutral behavior dominates large evolutionary scales.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bacterial toxin that alters host innate immune defense by hijacking host proteins involved in the ubiquitin proteolytic system. P. aeruginosa is recognized as the most common bacterial pathogen in ventilator-associated pneumonia and is commonly isolated from community-acquired pneumonia patients. While P. aeruginosa can cause devastating acute infections, many studies have documented that P. aeruginosa can also generate chronic infections in immunocompromised individuals, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis patients. In these patients, the ineffective host immune response to the bacterial colonization is thought to play a large role in deteriorating lung function and ultimately the death of the patient. Our findings have significant implications to the study of P. aeruginosa infections in the lung, particularly the ability of P. aeruginosa to disrupt critical host innate immune response mechanisms.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, cystic fibrosis (CF), and bronchiectasis.

Infections by hookworms and roundworms for example cause anemia, widespread developmental problems and devalued immunity against bacterial infections such as salmonella and tuberculosis. Although treatable with drugs, parasitic nematode re-infections occur as humans do not develop protective immunity. Ultimately, the public health burden caused by these infections will be best controlled by the development of vaccines against nematode infections. For these to be effective, it is important to understand how the various components of the immune system can respond to infection. In this study, we show that B cells, which typically protect against infection by producing antibodies, can also protect against an experimental hookworm like nematode infection by additional mechanisms. This form of protection instead depended on B cells producing cytokines associated with parasitic nematode expulsion and also by providing T cells with specific instruction. Together, these B cell driven responses lead to a rapid resolution of the infection. These important findings indicate that vaccination strategies against nematode parasites such as hookworms need to understand immune responses other than antibody to be optimally protective.","B cells play an important role in the innate immune response to pathogens such as N. brasiliensis. In this study, we investigated the role of B cells in protective immunity against N. brasiliensis infection in mice.

So far there are no effective treatments available. This study evaluates the protective efficacy of 8 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, in mice and guinea pigs. Various combinations and doses of the neutralizing and non-neutralizing MAbs were tested, and a post-exposure treatment protocol was determined. There was 100% survival when guinea pigs received a mix of 3 neutralizing MAbs two days after a challenge with 1,000 LD50 of guinea pig-adapted EBOV. This data suggests that the MAbs generated are effective as a post-exposure therapeutic for a lethal Ebola virus infection. Development of a post-exposure therapeutic for an Ebola virus infection is vital due to the high lethality of the disease, the relative speed in which it kills, and the fact that no vaccine has been approved for human use. Additionally, is it unlikely that preventative vaccines will be employed, because Ebola virus infections occur primarily in Africa, and to date have only killed approximately 2,300 people making it financially unfeasible for a mass vaccination. Therefore, having an effective therapy in the event of an outbreak would be extremely beneficial.","Ebola virus (EBOV) is a deadly virus that causes acute hemorrhagic fever in humans, non-human primates, and animals.

Current treatments are not optimal; however, several molecules that inhibit HCV replication are in development. However, resistance to individual antivirals is likely to develop, requiring therapy consisting of a combination of drugs targeting different stages of the viral life cycle. The entry of HCV into hepatocytes is a multistep process, involving at least four cellular receptors, leading to virion endocytosis and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Unlike the HCV replication process, these steps have not been thoroughly exploited as targets for antiviral intervention. Therefore, we screened a small molecule library for inhibitors of HCV entry and identified a compound, EI-1, that potently blocked genotype 1a and 1b HCV infection. Importantly, EI-1 also prevented direct cell-to-cell spread of HCV, a potentially significant route of transmission in infected livers. In addition, our studies suggest that EI-1 susceptibility is mediated by the viral E2 envelope glycoprotein, as resistance in E2 can overcome inhibition. The antiviral activity of EI-1 is potentiated by combinations with other HCV inhibitors, demonstrating the value of entry inhibitors in potential combination antiviral regimens.","The entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes is a critical step in the transmission of the virus to the liver.

Here, we performed a 1 M SNP genome-wide association study using a large cohort of Chinese study participants at risk for NPC. Although several putative gene regions show significant associations, the strongest statistical signals involved scores of variants within the HLA region on chromosome 6. HLA poses a formidable association-genetics challenge because of extensive linkage disequilibrium, rather low allele frequencies, and multiple physically close interacting genes of diverse function. We examined over 250 NPC-HLA associated variants detected with sequence-based nucleotide alleles and amino acid variants. The multiple associations were collapsed to implicate causal signals by multivariate logistical regression to resolve allele association interaction. One operative variant was identified as the HLA-A*11:01 allele motif, specifically in the peptide binding groove, which recognizes invading antigens; a second involved two aa sites with HLA-B tracking B*13:01 and B*55:02 alleles.

Accurate real-time forecasts of whether or not initial reports will be followed by a major outbreak are necessary for efficient deployment of control. For all infectious diseases, there is a delay between infection and the appearance of symptoms, i.e. an initial period following first infection during which infected individuals remain presymptomatic. We use mathematical modeling to evaluate the effect of presymptomatic infection on predictions of major epidemics. Our results show rigorously, for the first time, that precise estimates of the current number of infected individuals—and consequently the chance of a major outbreak in future—cannot be inferred from data on symptomatic cases alone. This is the case even if the values of epidemiological parameters, such as the average infection and death or recovery rates of individuals in the population, can be estimated accurately. Accurate prediction is in fact impossible without additional data from which the number of currently infected but as yet presymptomatic individuals can be deduced.","The early stages of an infectious disease epidemic are the most predictable in terms of the number of cases and the spread of the disease.

One possible mechanism for synchronization is that the systems jointly create and then share a common signal, such as a mean electrical field or a global chemical concentration, which in turn makes each system directly connected to all others. Conversely, extracting meaningful information from average measurements over populations of cells (as commonly used for instance in electro-encephalography, or more recently in brain-machine interfaces) may require the presence of synchronization mechanisms similar to those we describe.","The role of the nervous system in the brain is well known, but how does it work?

In this study, we evaluated the spatio-temporal structure and phylogeography of Colombian Ae. aegypti populations from cities showing different eco-epidemiologic attributes related to dengue fever. Our results indicated that Colombian Ae. aegypti populations harbor two mitochondrial lineages related to West and East African ancestors.

One essential component of meiotic prophase I is the exchange of genetic information between maternal and paternal chromosomes, known as recombination or crossing over, and is mediated, at least in part, by the mismatch repair proteins MSH4–MSH5 and MLH1–MLH3. A distinct subset of crossovers in lower organisms is generated by an alternate pathway involving Mus81 endonuclease. Previous studies into the impact of Mus81 mutations in mice revealed no adverse effect on the fertility of these animals. In this study, we report subtle, yet significant, defects in meiotic progression in male and female Mus81 mice, coupled with intriguing results showing that MUS81 protein is essential for crossover control in mammals. MUS81 appears to be required for correct localization of MLH1–MLH3 complexes to paired homologous chromosomes, however, not for the maintenance of physical crossovers, visualized as chiasmata.

This region is also a dengue hyperendemic setting. Laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection during pregnancy is challenging due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses, especially dengue. The neutralization test, which is the gold standard to discriminate between these viruses, is time-consuming, performed in few laboratories and does not define the time when the infection occurred. This study described the serological markers of ZIKV and DENV among participants (mothers and neonates) of a microcephaly case-control study conducted in Northeast Brazil (2016). Our results showed a strikingly high frequency of ZIKV exposure among mothers after the first wave of the ZIKV outbreak in this setting. Additionally, ZIKV and DENV immune status, as detected by the neutralization test, showed distinct patterns among pregnant women in this endemic area. We detected a low frequency of serological markers of recent ZIKV infection in samples collected just after delivery, highlighting the need for screening for ZIKV immune status in the early stage and throughout pregnancy to monitor congenital ZIKV syndrome.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly, in babies born to mothers infected with the virus during pregnancy. Zika virus infection during pregnancy is challenging to cross-react with dengue virus (DENV) in newborns, and it is difficult to determine the time of ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Here, we describe the maternal-fetal transfer antibodies (MFATs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) of ZIKV in neonates of mothers infected with the virus during the 2016 Zika microcephaly outbreak in Northeast Brazil. We found that maternal-fetal transfer antibodies (MFATs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) of ZIKV in neonates of mothers infected with the virus during the 2016 Zika microcephaly outbreak in Northeast Brazil were slightly higher in mothers with microcephaly than in mothers without microcephaly.

While insulin resistance is always present in the early phase, it is β-cell failure that determines the pace of the disease onset. Increasing evidence that the immune system is activated and plays an important role in type 2 diabetes has stimulated efforts of developing drugs targeting inflammatory cytokines. We built a model to describe the principles of type 2 diabetes onset under the influence of interleukin-1β. The disease onset is understood in terms of bifurcation. It is found that inflammatory cytokines are required to be suppressed for a limited time only, while glucose has to be controlled over the long term.

However, the mechanisms promoting immunopathology in patients are still unclear. We performed gene expression profiling of skin lesions from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients and normal skin and the results demonstrated that the most expressed genes in leishmanial lesions were associated with the cytolytic pathway. Using both human samples and mouse models we showed that CD8+ T cells are cytolytic within leishmanial lesions and kill Leishmania infected target cells. We found that the CD8+ T cell cytolytic response was not protective, but rather promoted increased immunopathology, associated with enhanced recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. CD8+ T cells also promoted the development of metastatic lesions at distant skin sites. Together, our results clearly demonstrate that activation of CD8+ T cell cytolytic responses is detrimental to the host and that targeting this pathway could be a new approach to treat patients with leishmaniasis.","cutaneous leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the intracellular parasite Leishmania.

Common approaches to characterize proteome allocation are based on annotations of protein functions or transcriptional regulatory targets. Here, we develop a novel approach based on model-predicted proteome utilization. This approach reveals that in many environments, a large fraction of the proteome is unused. Unused protein expression is known to incur costs on organismal fitness. We show that changes in the allocation of the proteome to used versus unused fractions can account for the variability in growth rates observed across environments and is a common mechanism to increase growth rates in laboratory evolution experiments. We compare our approach to classify the proteome based on model-predicted utilization to more traditional approaches to reveal biological functions and transcriptional regulators underlying the expression of unused protein. Expression of these functions may reflect ecological trade-offs between growth, nutrient-readiness, and stress resistance.","Expression of un-utilised protein (benefits of current environment) incurs quantifiable fitness costs in cellular growth rates. However, the magnitude of variability in un-utilised protein expression in natural settings is largely unknown.

Like other complex organisms, schistosomes and other parasitic worms regulate their cell biology through extensive use of enzymes called protein kinases that phosphorylate other proteins to alter their function. One such protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), has been proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of parasitic infections and cancer. Here we use biochemical techniques to show that schistosome worms possess a functional PKA pathway that is required for survival of the parasites. We also identify a parasite gene that encodes a functional PKA enzyme and show that silencing this gene results in both significant loss of PKA activity in schistosome worms and parasite death. These findings suggest that the gene we have identified is critically important to schistosomes and that its protein product may represent a target for the development of much-needed new drugs to treat schistosome infections.","Schistosoma mansoni is a protozoan helminth parasite that causes schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection that affects millions of people around the world.

Acetylcholine slows the heart rate by activating the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) that, in turn, opens the acetylcholine-activated potassium channel (IK,ACh) to slow the firing of the sinus node. Surprisingly, the M2R is sensitive to membrane potential and undergoes conformational changes throughout the cardiac action potential that alter the affinity for acetylcholine, with secondary consequences for IK,ACh activity. Here, we investigated the contribution of M2R voltage sensitivity to the rate and shape of the human sinus node action potential in physiological and pathophysiological conditions, using a Markovian model of the IK,ACh channel integrated into a computational model of human sinus node. The computational model allowed us to assess the effects of potential genetic variants that alter specific properties of voltage sensitivity.

However, numerous experimental studies demonstrate that connexin-based channels expressed in neuronal gap junctions can change their conductance in response to a transjunctional voltage or various chemical reagents. In addition, electrical synapses may exhibit direction-dependent asymmetry of signal transfer. To account for all these phenomena, we combined a 36-state model of gap junction channel gating with Hodgkin–Huxley equations, which describes neuronal excitability. The combined model (HH-36SM) allowed us to evaluate the kinetics of junctional conductance during the spread of electrical signal or in response to chemical factors. Our modeling results, which were based on experimental data, demonstrated that electrical synapses exhibit a complex behavior that can strongly affect the response of coupled neurons. We suggest that the proposed modeling approach is also applicable to describe the behavior of cardiac or other excitable cell networks interconnected through gap junction channels.","The electrical properties of a gap junction channel are closely related to the electrical properties of a cell-to-cell signaling pathway.

Here we describe a novel DSB response mechanism whereby ATM–dependent miR-335 downregulates CtIP. CtIP is a multifunctional protein that is crucial for DNA homologous recombination repair; and we show, for the first time, that this protein is subject to miRNA downregulation. CtIP downregulation was verified in cell lines from radiosensitive patients, and we demonstrate that this pathway contributes to radiosensitization and DNA repair defects in BRCA1 foci formation and cell cycle checkpoint.

The benefits are many and it is commonly believed that modern brain functions have emerged from ancestral forms evolved for effective navigation. Since the time of Charles Darwin, it has been recognized that path integration is a navigation strategy innate to many species. Path integration involves adding the stepwise displacements during a circuitous journey to compute a net homeward direction. Over the past century, this phenomenon has been described for birds to mammals to arthropods, and a long list of mathematical, algorithmic, and neural network models have been proposed to explain the necessary computations. This work shows how the different types of models behave in the presence of noise. It turns out that only one class of models can function properly in the presence of noise. Since noise appears to be present at all levels of brain physiology, we arrive at the surprising conclusion that the general computational principles for path integration must be the same across all species. Two subtypes of path integration models share the same critical computational principles, and are compared to known neuroanatomy and physiology.","The ability of animals to navigate in space is fundamental to their survival and survival in the animal kingdom.

Here, we incorporate previously reported biochemical and crystallographic data with structural mass spectroscopy and electron microscopic data to derive a detailed, experimentally-supported quaternary structure of the physiological compact form of spectrin. In addition to explaining spectrin’s physiological resting length (~55–65 nm), our model provides a mechanism by which spectrin can undergo a seamless three-fold extension, which is an experimentally observed property that is responsible for restoration of cell shape after mechanical deformation.","The spectrin heterotetramer is a complex molecule with a wide range of structural and functional properties. The molecular structure of the spectrin heterotetramer is reasonably defined, but the structural basis for the dramatic molecular shape change and molecular length increase-fold, known as spectrin shape change, is unknown. In this study, we combine previously reported biochemical high-resolution crystallographic data with structural mass spectroscopy electron microscopic data to derive detailed quaternary structure spectrin heterotetramer. We show that the spectrin quaternary structure is able to undergo seamless-fold extension of the remaining linear filament of the spectrin heterotetramer, experimentally observed property. Furthermore, we show that the spectrin quaternary structure mechanism is similar to the prototypical Chinese Finger Trap : shorter molecular lengths spectrin hollow cylinder extends increasing pitch spectrin repeat, decreases internal diameter, and the spectrin quaternary structure is supported by zero-length chemical crosslink data indicative of approximately 90 degree bend adjacent spectrin repeats.",18.769398773006134

The latter events occur despite the presence of immune IgG antibodies. IgG acts by neutralization of virions and activation of immune cells bearing one or more surface receptors, called FcγRs, recognizing the constant Fc domain of IgG. Activating FcγRs induce a wide range of immune responses, including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of virus-infected cells by natural killer (NK) cells, cytokine secretion and the uptake of immune complexes to enhance antigen presentation to T cells. We demonstrate that the HCMV glycoproteins RL11/gp34 and UL119-118/gp68 block IgG-mediated activation of FcγRs. A novel reporter cell-based assay was used to test FcγRs individually and assess their relative susceptibility to each antagonist. This approach revealed that gp34 and gp68 block triggering of activating FcγRs, i.e. FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32A) and FcγRIII (CD16). Co-immunoprecipitation showed the formation of ternary complexes containing IgG, IgG-bound antigen and the viral antagonists on the cell surface.

Differential effects of IL-32γ on TNFα, IL-10 and IL-1Ra production after infection with distinct Leishmania species were detected, consistent with the concept that IL-32γ can differently influence the outcome of inflammatory process in leishmaniasis lesions. Moreover, IL-32γ upregulates microbicidal molecules, antimicrobial peptides, as well as NO, which are known as important factors in parasite control.

From these two observations one can assume that the global biological carbon cycle has always been based on , and we show here that this assumption can be used as a powerful constraint to help organize and explain the deep evolution of life on Earth. Using a novel method that fully integrates aspects of metabolic and phylogenetic analysis, we are able to reconstruct the complete early evolutionary history of biological carbon-fixation, relating all ways in which life today performs this function to a single ancestral form. The diversification in carbon-fixation appears to underpin most of the deepest branches in the tree of life, and this early metabolic diversification – reaching back to the first cells – appears to have been driven not by the contingencies of history, but by direct links to the physical-chemical environment. The ancestral carbon-fixation pathway that we identify is different from any modern form, but better suited to the capabilities of the earliest primitive cells.","Carbon-fixation is the process by which carbon is transported from the Earth to the Earth's surface and is essential for life on Earth.

We sequenced the genome of the closest known endemic relative of M. graminicola infecting wild grass hosts. A comparative genome analysis allowed us to infer how speciation and host specialization processes have influenced pathogen evolution. The wild grass-adapted pathogen can infect wheat, but M. graminicola shows a significantly higher degree of host specificity and virulence in a detached leaf assay. The genomes of the pathogens are 7% divergent with a high degree of synteny in the 13 essential core chromosomes. However, structural rearrangements have strongly affected eight small dispensable chromosomes. These chromosomes also show altered rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions. We found 43 genes showing evidence of positive selection. As the divergence of species occurred very recently, these genes are likely involved in host specialization or speciation. None of the genes have a known function, although one encodes a signal peptide and is a potential pathogen effector.

The role of specific brain areas in sensory perception is typically studied using two kinds of laboratory experiments: those that measure correlations between neural activity and reported percepts, and those that inactivate a brain region and measure the resulting changes in percepts. The two types of experiments have generally been interpreted in isolation, in part because no theory has been able combine their outcomes. Here, we describe a mathematical framework that synthesizes both kinds of results, giving us a new way to assess how different brain areas contribute to perception. When we apply our framework to experiments on behaving monkeys, we discover two models that can explain the perplexing finding that one brain area can predict an animal’s reported percepts, even though the percepts are not affected when that brain area is inactivated. The two models ascribe dramatically different efficiencies to brain computation. We show that these two models could be distinguished by a proposed experiment that measures correlations while inactivating different brain areas.","The neural basis of perception has long been the subject of debate.

There is much disagreement in the literature with regard to the dominant route of influenza transmission. Using empirical estimates where possible, we vary 18 parameters which are relevant to these transmission routes. These parameters are features of the agent, host, or environment. Depending on these features, a specific route or routes may be operating at a high intensity. Thus, it is unlikely there is a single universal dominant influenza transmission route. Therefore, interventions which target only one of these routes will not be optimal in all settings. It is important to understand the context in terms of the agent, host, and environment in order to develop optimal environmental intervention strategies.","Influenza is a highly infectious disease caused by the influenza A H1N1 virus.

Enhanced mTORC1 activity also drives innate immune responses by modulating protein expression of antiviral genes.

Active-site dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitors (asTORi) have been developed for superior mTOR inhibition and anti-cancer potency but have not been studied in the context of oncolytic viral infection. We show here that prolonged treatment with asTORi strongly augments infection of HSV1-dICP0 in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, an effect modulated via eIF4E/4E-BP expression.

Consequences of infection include anemia, stunted growth, liver abnormalities, and subfertility. Currently, the main approach to schistosomiasis control involves mass preventive treatment of school-aged children in endemic areas. The treatment, praziquantel, can be distributed through school-based, community-based, or combined school- and community-based systems. The first part of this systematic review compared the three delivery modes and found that combined delivery resulted in the best overall coverage of school-aged children, with community-only delivery the next-best approach. School-only delivery not only had the lowest overall coverage, but especially fell behind in targeting children not enrolled in school. As a whole, these results support the more frequent use of a combined approach to delivery in order to achieve the highest coverage rates and ensure that out-of-school children are not left persistently untreated. In the second part of this review the qualitative factors affecting program success were examined. The results indicate that overall treatment coverage can be improved via small interventions, such as snacks for participating children to reduce drug side effects, educational campaigns about schistosomiasis, incentives for drug distributors, and active inclusion of marginalized groups.","The mainstay of current schistosomiasis control programs is the mass preventive chemotherapy of school-aged children with praziquantel. Treatment delivered in school-based, community-based, or combined school-community-based systems has been shown to achieve high coverage rates, ensuring persistently untreated subpopulations and, potentially, a challenge for school-based programs in areas with low school enrollment. We sought to compare different treatment delivery methods based on coverage of school-aged children overall, specifically non- enrolled children. We also identified qualitative community programmatic factors associated with high coverage rates, suggesting that the overall coverage improvement could be improved.",15.641274509803925

We have identified an Arabidopsis thaliana hybrid with several aberrant growth phenotypes that are caused by divergence at a single locus encoding the receptor-like kinase OUTGROWTH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN KINASE (OAK). OAK belongs to a group of similar genes arranged in a tandem cluster that varies substantially between A. thaliana strains. OAK originated through duplication within the cluster with concurrent recruitment of coding sequences from nearby genes to form a new promoter with a novel expression pattern. Kinase activity of OAK is required for its effects, indicating that it is not recognition of an aberrant protein but rather a true gain of function that leads to the incompatibility. Most of the incompatibility seems to come from divergence within the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the OAK protein, indicating that heterodimers of OAK may have higher affinity for a natural substrate compared to either homodimer. Finally, mis-expression of the incompatible OAK alleles from the promoter present in the reference strain of A. thaliana also leads to genetic incompatibility, but with different phenotypic outcomes.","Non- additive interactions between genes are important for understanding the evolution of phenotypes.

Previously, extensive research has focused on the molecular mechanisms of biological processes in yeast, but many questions regarding yeast budding remain unsolved. For example, how do different budding patterns affect yeast colony growth? How does declined spatial order due to aging impact the colony at the population level? To address these questions, we developed a computational agent-based model, which incorporates key biological processes, the effect of aging, as well as cell-environment interaction. We performed and analyzed a large number of simulations for a variety of situations, and obtained insightful results. We found that axial budding pattern enhances the percentage of diploid cells at early stage and bipolar budding pattern improves colony development under nutrient limitation; the frequency of mating type switch might control the trade-off between diploidization and inbreeding; aging affects the percentage of diploid cells in colonies initiated by a single haploid cell, but does not have much influence in the expansion of colonies initiated by diploid cells. The framework of the model can be extended to study other important systems, such as tissue with stem cell lineage.","Budding yeast undergoes polarized growth during budding mating, a useful model system to study cell polarization.

However, disease burden has primarily been estimated at the national scale, which does not account for sub-country variations in burden levels. We used the case of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a highly focal NTD, in Uganda to calculate and map burden in DALYs. Our results show that HAT burden is highly sensitive to under-reporting estimates, and is particularly high in heavily affected parishes and districts of Uganda. Some districts in southeastern Uganda had HAT burden rates comparable to the national burden rates of major infectious diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS. Thus, the spatial scale of burden estimation is crucial, especially for focal diseases such as HAT, and national-level estimates may not reflect the level of impact in afflicted communities.

The interferons (IFNs) are strongly induced by IAV and are known to mediate host resistance to the infection. However, in contrast to their well-studied inhibitory effect on viral replication, the effects of IFNs on host inflammatory responses are less well understood. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that anti-viral IFN signaling is also required for the orchestration of a tissue response associated with the protection against IAV infection in mice. Importantly, we identify that type I IFNs cross-regulate and cooperate with IFN-γ to inhibit monocyte activation and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. This study also demonstrates that Ly6Clo monocytes/macrophages can potentially mediate influenza virus-induced inflammation, suggesting that IFNs dictate the homeostasis versus inflammatory function of mononuclear phagocytes in viral infection. Our study reveals a novel IFN-dependent regulatory mechanism designed to prevent the excessive immunopathology while preserving its anti-microbial functions. Moreover, these observations have particular relevance for understanding the mechanisms underlying the strong inflammatory response associated with lethal IAV strains and have implications for the development of new immunotherapies to treat influenza.","Influenza A virus (IAV) causes exuberant pulmonary inflammation characterized by influx of myeloid cells and production of proinflammatory cytokines including interferons (IFNs).

This analysis provides genome-wide evidence that microRNA genes have the same type of promoter sequences as protein-coding genes, and therefore are likely transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II). Second, we present a novel computational method for promoter prediction, which is then applied to locate the core promoters of known microRNA genes in the four model species. Furthermore, we present an analysis of short DNA motifs that appear frequently in the predicted promoters of microRNA genes, and report several interesting motifs that may have some functional meanings.

We found ale, baking, and the S. cerevisiae portion of lager strains to have ancestry that is a mixture of European grape wine strains and Asian rice wine strains and that they carry novel alleles from an extinct or uncharacterized population. The mixed ancestry of beer strains has been maintained in a polyploid state, which provided a means of strain diversification through gain or loss of genetic variation within a strain but also a means of maintaining brewing characteristics by reducing or eliminating genetic exchange with other strains.

Facilitated by their ancient association with intracellular symbiotic bacteria that synthesize essential amino acids, aphids feed on phloem (sap). Exploitation of a diversity of long-lived woody and short-lived herbaceous hosts by many aphid species is a result of specializations that allow aphids to discover and exploit suitable host plants. Such specializations include production by a single genotype of multiple alternative phenotypes including asexual, sexual, winged, and unwinged forms. We have generated a draft genome sequence of the pea aphid, an aphid that is a model for the study of symbiosis, development, and host plant specialization. Some of the many highlights of our genome analysis include an expanded total gene set with remarkable levels of gene duplication, as well as aphid-lineage-specific gene losses. We find that the pea aphid genome contains all genes required for epigenetic regulation by methylation, that genes encoding the synthesis of a number of essential amino acids are distributed between the genomes of the pea aphid and its symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, and that many genes encoding immune system components are absent.

These stages of the life cycle are often initiated by environmental conditions and occur seasonally. However, many herbaceous perennial species such as strawberry, rose, or Arabis alpina contain varieties that flower continuously irrespective of the seasons. Here we characterize this genetic variation in A. alpina and show that five continuously flowering accessions carry independent mutations in the PERPETUAL FLOWERING 1 (PEP1) gene. These mutations impair the activity of the PEP1 floral repressor causing the plants to flower without requirement for winter cold and to flower continuously. This result has interesting parallels with strawberry and rose, where inactivation of a different floral repressor controlling response to day length gives rise to naturally occurring perpetual flowering forms. We also show that PEP1 in A. alpina has a complex duplicated structure that gives rise to two overlapping transcripts. This arrangement differs from the simple structure of PEP1 orthologues in related annual species, such as FLC of Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that duplication of PEP1 might contribute to the complex transcriptional patterns associated with PEP1 function in perennials. Our work provides insight into genetic variation contributing to the perennial life history of plants.","Annual plants and perennial plants divide their life cycles into vegetative and flowering phases. Previously, the environmental cues that control the life histories of annuals and perennials have been studied in detail. Here, we show that natural genetic variation conferring differences in the perennial life cycle of Arabis alpina is associated with differences in the flowering phase of the plant. We show that a single gene, PEP1, encodes a box transcription factor that represses the flowering phase of A. thaliana. This gene encodes the MADS box transcription factor LOCUS C, which is required for the flowering phase of A. thaliana. We also show that the PEP1 locus contains a tandem arrangement length and partial PEP1 copy, suggesting that variation in the PEP1 locus arises independently of time. Our results provide a paradigm for the phenotypic variation found in herbaceous perennial species.",12.988701298701297

This specialization is thought to be regulated via response thresholds to task-specific cues, which vary between workers conducting different tasks. Whether a worker takes care of the brood, cares for other workers, or leaves the nest to search for food is influenced by age, fat content, and the expression of associated genes. In the ant Temnothorax longispinosus, workers specializing in brood care are younger and exhibit a high expression of the gene Vg-like A. Here, we demonstrate that young workers reduce brood care activity upon down-regulation of Vg-like A. Simultaneously, they increase care for adult nestmates, a behavior typically exhibited by older workers. We show experimentally that Vg-like A down-regulation alters perception of social cues: a shift in the responsiveness from chemical cues from brood to adult worker underlies the behavioral switch to nestmate care. Hence, the expression of Vg-like A and its associated pathways influences task choice in ants and is involved in the regulation of division of labor. Copies of Vg-like A are present in other ants and further social and solitary insects, and future studies will reveal the role of this gene in these organisms.","Division labor is an important task in social insect societies.

These are made approximately three to four times every second, and larger saccades result from fast and concurrent movement of the animal's eyes and head. Experimental studies have revealed that during saccades, the motor system follows certain principles such as respecting a specific relationship between the relative contribution of eye and head motor systems to total gaze shift. Various researchers have hypothesized that these principles are implications of some optimality criteria in the brain, but it remains unclear how the brain can learn such an optimal behavior. We propose a new model that uses a plausible learning mechanism to satisfy an optimality criterion. We show that after learning, the model is able to reproduce motor behavior with biologically plausible properties. In addition, it predicts the nature of the learning signals. Further experimental research is necessary to test the validity of our model.","In this paper, we present a neural model of coordinated eye head movements.

Although this disease can be quickly lethal to its host, it has persisted on long-term in many rodent populations around the world. The reasons for this persistence remain poorly known. Two mechanisms have been invoked, but not yet explicitly and independently tested: first, the spatial structure of rodent populations (subdivision into several subpopulations) and secondly, the presence of, not only plague-susceptible rodents, but also plague-resistant ones. To gain insight into the role of the above two factors in plague persistence, we analysed a mathematical model of plague propagation. We applied our analyses to the case of Madagascar, where plague has persisted on central highlands since the 1920s and is responsible for about 30% of the human cases worldwide. We found that the long-term persistence of plague can be explained by the presence of any of the above two factors. These results allowed us to propose scenarios to explain the localized presence of plague in the Malagasy highlands, and help understand the persistence of plague in many wild foci.","bubonic plague is a highly virulent disease that is endemic in many parts of the world.

Limitations of data analysis are also considered and we show that the choice of the significance threshold for coherence does not essentially impact the statistics of the observed phase lags, although it is crucial for the right detection of statistically significant coherence. Analytical insights are obtained for networks with heterogeneous time-delays, based on the empirical data from the connectome, and these are confirmed by numerical simulations, which show in- or anti-phase synchronization depending on the frequency and the distribution of time-delays.

The inability of HCV to penetrate non-human cells is primarily due to inefficient usage of non-human CD81 and occludin. In this study we adapted HCV to mouse CD81. Efficient utilization of mouse CD81 is conferred by a combination of three mutations in the viral glycoproteins. These changes also permit entry via rat or hamster CD81, and lower viral dependence on additional HCV entry factors. Strikingly, mouse CD81 adapted HCV glycoproteins mediate entry into mouse cells in the absence of human entry factors. The adaptive mutations are not resident in viral domains implicated in direct CD81 binding. Nevertheless, they enhance binding to human CD81, increase susceptibility to different neutralizing antibodies and facilitate induction of viral cell fusion by low pH. This suggests that structural changes accompanied by exposure of the CD81 binding site and neutralizing epitopes have “unlocked” the viral envelope protein complex facilitating infection through non-human entry factors. These results highlight mechanisms of HCV receptor usage and tropism. They also demonstrate that HCV can be adapted to using non-human host factors, which may ultimately facilitate the development of small animal models.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common cause of liver disease in humans and is a major cause of liver cancer in humans.

Our work identifies Pim-1 and Pim-3 kinases as essential key regulators of the gammaherpesvirus life cycle. These kinases target the hallmark of KSHV latency, the LANA protein, by phosphorylation, which abolishes its ability to act as a transcriptional suppressor of viral lytic replication.

This is particularly challenging during meiosis, when the sister chromatids must remain partially connected to each other through the first division. In organisms that have a single focal centromere on each chromosome, such as mammals and flies, cohesin is protected through the first meiotic division by the protein Shugoshin, which binds the PP2A phosphatase. PP2A counteracts phosphorylation by the Aurora B kinase; if certain cohesins are phosphorylated by Aurora B they become targeted for removal, which allows the chromatids to separate. In the nematode C. elegans, the chromosomes lack a localized centromere and the predicted Shugoshin homolog is not required for protection of cohesins; instead, this function is executed in metaphase of the first meiotic division by the protein LAB-1. But it is not completely understood what leads to the deposition of cohesin prior to entry into meiosis and to its maintenance throughout early meiosis I. In this study, we show that LAB-1 is also required for the loading and maintenance of the cohesin complex. LAB-1 ensures that the chromatids are not separated prematurely, and thus enables the proper progression of events through prophase I of meiosis. We propose that LAB-1 may act at the onset of meiosis in a manner akin to Shugoshin, by recruiting the PP1 phosphatase to counteract Aurora B kinase, thereby ensuring sister chromatid cohesion.","C. elegans is a model organism for the study of meiosis, a process in which the chromosomal association of cohesin complex subunit SMC-3 is required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in the prophase I of the worm.

The nature of this process depends critically on the weight given to evidence across time: which information has more impact—early, intermediate or late? We used a novel psychophysical technique, which relies on differential temporal dispersion of evidence. This technique allowed us to extract the temporal weights people assign to the flow of evidence. We find that in decisions that are based on relatively short streams of evidence, people gave stronger weight to early information (primacy). Surprisingly, however, with longer streams of evidence, people assigned higher weights to early and late evidence, while underweighting intermediate evidence. This non-monotonic pattern of evidence integration is not predicted by the existing models of decision-making, posing a challenge to current theories. We propose a novel model that accounts for non-monotonic weighting, based on a change in leak and response-competition with integration-time, and we discuss potential neural mechanisms.","Perceptual decisions thought to be mediated by sequential sampling integration are thought to be the mechanism by which decision-making integrates noisy evidence of temporal weighting profile.

However, they are thought to increase inflammation during highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 infections, which cause severe and often fatal disease in humans. This is based on experiments with human macrophages cultured from monocytes rather than with human AM. Here we show that human AM, collected via broncho-alveolar lavage from healthy volunteers, can become infected with HPAIV H5N1. However, this results in neither induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha nor virus production. Therefore, AM are most likely not responsible for the excessive cytokine response or high viral load during human HPAIV H5N1 infections as assumed previously. These data significantly changes our insight into the pathogenesis of HPAIV H5N1 pneumonia in humans, indicating that other cells than AM must be responsible for the excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine profile observed during HPAIV H5N1 infections.","Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 causes severe and fatal pneumonia in humans.

Vector control is capable of completely interrupting HAT transmission but is not used because of expense. We conducted a full scale field trial of a refined vector control technology. From preliminary trials we determined the number of insecticidal tiny targets required to control tsetse populations by more than 90%. We then carried out a full scale, 500 km2 field trial covering two HAT foci in Northern Uganda (overall target density 5.7/km2). In 12 months tsetse populations declined by more than 90%. A mathematical model suggested that a 72% reduction in tsetse population is required to stop transmission in those settings.

Even within single polypeptide chains, about 25% of proteins contain self-similar repeating structures, which can be organized in ring-like symmetric arrangements or linear open repeats. The repeats are often related, and thus comparing the sequence and structure of repeats can give an idea as to the early evolutionary history of a protein family. Additionally, the conservation and divergence of repeats can lead to insights about the function of the proteins. This work describes CE-Symm 2.0, a tool for the analysis of protein symmetry. The method automatically detects internal symmetry in protein structures and produces a multiple alignment of structural repeats. The algorithm is able to detect the geometric relationships between the repeats, including cyclic, dihedral, and polyhedral symmetries, translational repeats, and cases where multiple symmetry operators are applicable in a hierarchical manner. These complex relationships can then be visualized in a graphical interface as a complete structure, as a superposition of repeats, or as a multiple alignment of the protein sequence. CE-Symm 2.0 can be systematically used for the automatic detection of internal symmetry in protein structures, or as an interactive tool for the analysis of structural repeats.","Structural analysis of proteins is a fundamental tool for understanding protein function and evolution.

Here we focus on the relationship between two important layers and follow it over the first five days of differentiation. The first layer – measured by acetylation of one of the histone proteins – describes which parts of the DNA are tightly wrapped up and which lie open. The second layer describes the activity of genes measured by their mRNA expression. Using a wide array of statistical approaches we show that changes in histone acetylation are very predictive for gene expression and that the concordance between the two levels increases over time. Concentrating on genes central to the regulatory networks in embryonic stem cells we find that key genes show very high acetylation signal in the beginning that decreases quickly over time, indicating that they lie in initially open regions that are rapidly closing down. These results are a step forward to a better understanding of the complexities of the relationship between histone acetylation and gene expression, which will help to dissect the multilayer regulatory mechanisms that determine stem cell fate.","Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the potential to self-renew indefinitely and maintain pluripotency.

Inside these colonies, cells often express many different phenotypes. The significance of these phenotypes often remains unknown. We study the evolution of cell differentiation in the context of surface colonization. We particularly focus on the evolution of a ‘sticky’ cell type that is needed for surface attachment. We show that the sticky cell type readily evolves and escapes from competition in the liquid by attaching to the surface. In most cases, surface colonization is accompanied by phenotypic heterogeneity, in which sticky and non-sticky cell co-occupy the surface. The non-sticky cells hitchhike with the sticky cells, thereby profiting from surface attachment without paying the cost of being sticky. In the presence of regulation, cell differentiation leads to the evolution of intricate bacterial life cycles in which cells alternate between living in surface-attached colonies and living in the liquid. The bacterial life cycles are orchestrated by temporal and spatial pattern formation of cell types. Our model illustrates how cell differentiation can be of key importance for the evolution of bacterial life cycles.","Bacteria live in colonies and express different cell types. The ecological significance of cell types is unknown, and the evolutionary origin of the cell types is unknown. Here, we study the evolution of the adhesive cell type required for surface attachment in a bacterial colony.

Though absent in some species, DNA methylation is conserved across fungi, plants and animals and plays a critical role in X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, transposon silencing etc. In addition, DNA methylation also occurs at the promoter sequence to regulate gene expression. Filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has a well-known mechanism of DNA methylation for genomic defense. During sexual stage repetitive sequences (e.g. transposons) are recognized and point mutations are introduced. During vegetative stage these mutations serve as signals for establishing static DNA methylation to silence all copies of the sequences. In this study, we report a new type of DNA methylation in Neurospora. It is tightly linked to a type of non-coding small RNA termed dicer-independent siRNA (disiRNA) and therefore was termed disiRNA loci DNA methylation (DLDM). DLDM is dynamic regulated and shows an on/off pattern, i.e. most alleles contain no 5mC but some are densely methylated. Interestingly, DLDM can be triggered by convergent transcription and is accumulated at promoter regions.

This reflects the successful evasion and suppression of host immune responses by the parasites. One of the mechanisms that could underlie this phenomenon is modulation of the dendritic cells (DC), which play a central role in initiation and control of T cell responses. Although several in vitro studies have documented the modulatory capacity of Schistosoma antigens on DC function, it is still unclear what effect schistosomiasis has on human DC function in vivo. To address this question, we isolated the two main DC subsets present in peripheral blood from infected and uninfected individuals living in a Schistosoma-endemic area in central Africa, and found that specifically the myeloid DC from Schistosoma-infected subjects displayed an impaired capacity to respond to Toll-like receptor ligands and to drive T cell responses. These findings provide new insights into how schistosomiasis suppresses host immune responses, which can be exploited for new strategies to enhance immunity against the parasites.","Schistosoma haematobium infection is characterized by a state of T cell hyporesponsiveness in the host.

Through evolution, current influenza viruses develop the ability to infect people who have been vaccinated against earlier strains. New strains of influenza that infect birds and pigs could evolve to infect and spread between people, causing a global pandemic. The influenza virus lives within a human or animal host, so that viral evolution happens within, or in the spread between, individuals. As such, what happens to the virus during the course of an infection is a question of great interest. We here describe a statistical method that uses viral genome sequence data to measure how evolution affects the influenza virus within a single host. Studying data from infections transmitted between pigs, we find evidence for evolutionary adaptation in six of sixteen animals for which data were available. In one case, an immune response mounted by a pig against the virus is apparent. Our method provides a statistical framework for using sequence data to study viral evolution on very short timescales, enabling new research into within-host viral evolution.","Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and is a major public health problem worldwide. However, the role of selection in the course of infection is not well understood. Here, we describe a method to measure selection acting on influenza virus in the individual host, based on time-resolved genome sequence data from infection. We find evidence for positive selection acting on specific alleles of the virus, and data suggest that selection is time-dependent. Infection observe potentially specific immune response virus; non- synonymous mutation region virus found initially positive, strongly negative selection.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all pregnant women in malaria-endemic areas receive intermittent treatment with pyrimethamine (IPTp) to prevent adverse birth outcomes associated with malaria pregnancy (MiP). However, the current coverage of IPTp-SP in Africa is low, and there are concerns about resistance to the drug. To address these concerns, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued an action plan to address the current low coverage of IPTp-SP in malaria-endemic areas. In this paper, we estimate the impact of IPTp-SP on MiP in malaria-endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa. We show that the current coverage of IPTp-SP in malaria-endemic areas is far optimal, and that expanding IPTp-SP coverage to 3 antenatal visits in Africa could prevent an additional 215,000 ( 128,000–318,000 95 % of all births) of children under 5 years of age.",13.535526315789479

In many species, transformability is a transient property relying on a specialized membrane-associated machinery for binding exogenous double-stranded DNA and internalization of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fragments extracted from exogenous DNA. Subsequent physical integration of internalized ssDNA into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination requires dedicated cytosolic ssDNA–processing proteins. Here, we document the roles in the model transformable species Streptococcus pneumoniae of one of these processing proteins, SsbB, a paralogue of SsbA the ssDNA–binding protein essential for genome maintenance in bacteria, which is expressed uniquely in cells competent for genetic transformation. We show that SsbB is highly abundant, potentially allowing the binding of ∼1.15 Mb ssDNA (half a genome equivalent); that it participates in the processing of ssDNA into recombinants; that it protects and stabilizes internalized ssDNA; and that, at high DNA concentration, it is of crucial importance for chromosomal transformation whilst antagonizing plasmid transformation.

Treatments for this disease, collectively termed invasive aspergillosis, are often not successful, and prospects for survival can be slim. A. fumigatus produces small molecules, termed siderophores, for acquisition and storage of iron, an element essential for growth. We found that these siderophores are crucial for virulence of A. fumigatus because their removal (by gene deletion) prevents or lessens disease in a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis.

In this report, we studied the timing of transcription for genes in the bacterial DNA damage repair pathway (known as the SOS response), a regulatory system where each gene is controlled by the same transcriptional repressor, LexA. By specifically isolating the role of the LexA binding interaction at SOS gene promoters, we found a relationship between the amount of DNA damage incurred by the cell, LexA binding kinetics at a promoter, and the timing of promoter activation. Our data fit a kinetic model that reveals how a disequilibrium between the LexA-operator binding reaction and cellular LexA concentrations causes timing differences between genes to emerge only at higher doses of DNA damage. Taken together, we show that non-equilibrium DNA binding kinetics is the mechanism by which a single transcription factor can modulate timing differences across an entire network of genes as a function of stimulus dose.","The DNA damage repair pathway (known as SOS response) in Escherichia coli, approximately 40 genes regulated by LexA repressor, triggers SOS gene transcription, temporally separated subsets ‘ early’, ‘middle’, ‘late’ genes.

We observed high susceptibility of magpie to WNV infection with virus titers higher than those necessary for the successful transmission of WNV to a mosquito and often resulting in death. Likewise, we detected elevated titers of neutralizing antibodies in all the samples tested as well as the viral genome in the organs, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and feather pulps of the infected animals.

These studies suggest that, aside from antibodies, other immune factors, such as CD4 T cells and TNF, are active in viraemia control. The work also supports the notion that CHIKV disease, with the exception of encephalitis, is largely an immunopathology. Persistent CHIKV RNA in wild-type mice continues to stimulate type I interferon and T cell responses, with this model of chronic disease recapitulating many of the features seen in chronic CHIKV patients.","Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes encephalitis, a severe form of arthritis, and dengue fever.

Computational models that can predict the effect of a new combination of drugs without having to test it experimentally can help in accelerating this process. In particular, network-based dynamic models of these pathways hold promise to both understand and predict the effect of therapeutics. However, their use is currently hampered by limitations in our knowledge of the underlying biochemistry, as well as in the experimental and computational technologies used for calibrating the models. Thus, the results from such models need to be carefully interpreted and used in order to avoid biased predictions. Here we present a procedure that deals with this uncertainty by using experimental data to build an ensemble of dynamic models. The method incorporates steps to reduce overfitting and maximize predictive capability. We find that by combining the outputs of individual models in an ensemble it is possible to obtain a more robust prediction. We report results obtained with this method, which we call SELDOM (enSEmbLe of Dynamic lOgic-based Models), showing that it improves the predictions previously reported for several challenging problems.","Signaling networks are networks of proteins that interact with each other, and are important for understanding biological processes.

Most studies of dynamic gain have focused on neurons without intrinsic degrees of freedom exhibiting integrator-type subthreshold dynamics. Many neuron types in the brain, however, exhibit complex subthreshold dynamics such as resonance, found for instance in cortical interneurons, stellate cells, and mitral cells. A resonator neuron has at least two degrees of freedom for which the classical Fokker-Planck approach to calculating the dynamic gain is largely intractable. Here, we lift the voltage-reset rule after a spike, allowing us to derive a complete expression of the dynamic gain of a resonator neuron model. We find the gain can exhibit only six shapes. The resonant ones have peaks that become large due to intrinsic adaptation and become sharp due to an intrinsic frequency. A resonance can nevertheless result from either property. The analysis presented here helps explain how intrinsic neuron dynamics shape population-level response properties and provides a powerful tool for developing theories of inter-neuron correlations and dynamic responses of neural populations.","The response of neurons to the input of a population of neurons depends on the intrinsic properties of the constituent neurons. The main modes of single neuron dynamics are integration resonance and dynamic gain, which are distinguished by the number of neurons in the brain.

Structural classification schemes focus on the assignment and organisation of protein domains into folds. However, they do not suggest how different folds might relate to one another in a global way. We introduce the concept of bridges through fold space: significant similarities between these units. We consider four alignment methods and a dynamic approach to placing these bridges. A greater consensus between these methods cannot be achieved by simply increasing the stringency with which edges are assigned. Instead, we emphasise the importance of considering consensus maps and only report results where there is agreement across all networks. It is possible that a study of the bridges may reveal evolutionary relationships. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of structures, we find that bridges consistently fall between folds which evolved at similar times. Moreover, the landscapes all consist of a core of older folds, with younger structures more often seen at the periphery. Finally we identify four pivotal folds in the landscapes. They contain topological motifs which unite disparate regions of fold space.","Protein structure classification schemes exist to partition protein universe structural units called folds into structural units called folds. schemes discuss units sit relative to global structure space.

To survive in the phagosome, Leishmania employs surface-bound glycoconjugates such as the GP63 metalloprotease and lipophosphoglycan to subvert the phagosome’s microbicidal potential. In particular, GP63 cleaves host cell vesicle fusion molecules that regulate phagosomal processes ranging from antigen cross-presentation to cytokine secretion. Unlike apicomplexan parasites and bacteria, Leishmania does not inject its virulence-associated glycoconjugates across the phagosome membrane. We found that post-phagocytosis, Leishmania co-opts the host cell secretory pathway to promote the egress of its virulence factors out of the phagosome. Importantly, chemical and genetic inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport hindered the redistribution of GP63 and lipophosphoglycan, thereby impeding the cleavage of GP63 target Synaptotagmin XI. Notably, knockdown ER/ERGIC-resident membrane fusion regulators Sec22b and syntaxin-5 revealed that these host molecules were essential to the phagosomal egress of Leishmania virulence factors. These findings provide new insight into how Leishmania sabotages the host cell endomembrane system for its own benefit.","Leishmania is a multi-drug-resistant bacterium that infects humans and other animals.

Cost-effective deployment requires understanding complex connections between rabies risk and healthcare seeking behavior. During 1995–2005, there was a rapid decline in dog and human rabies cases in several Latin American countries following concerted investment in mass dog vaccinations and human post-exposure vaccination. Using data from this period, we econometrically estimate relationships between dog vaccinations, dog rabies cases, human exposure reports, human post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use, and human rabies deaths. We estimate quantitatively how dog vaccinations indirectly reduce human rabies deaths, mediated through dog rabies cases, dog bite reporting, and PEP use. We find that reported human exposures decline as dog rabies cases decline, but these declines are offset by increases in reported exposures per dog rabies case, which may be driven by increased rabies awareness through anti-rabies campaigns. Furthermore, while PEP demand declines as dog rabies cases decline, increases in income and public health expenditures concurrently increase demand for PEP. These findings provide better understanding of the underlying factors driving PEP demand and exposure (under)reporting to inform cost-effective policy design to reduce unnecessary PEP prescription and false negatives leading to human death.","The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) resolved to eliminate human rabies deaths by 2030, and the Vaccine Alliance (G Gavi) added human rabies vaccines investments to its investments in 202125, but the cost-effectively sustainable implementation of these goals requires understanding complex connections between dog rabies vaccinations and human rabies deaths, mediated dog rabies cases, and dog bite reporting, post-exposure human rabies vaccination, and the use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for human rabies cases.

The models that would allow investigation of this disease are severely limited.

Indirect evidence suggests that this behaviour is, in part, instructed by hormones produced by the foetally derived placenta. We previously reported that the Phlda2 gene controls the size of the placental endocrine compartment that produces hormones. Phlda2 is subject to the remarkable epigenetic process called genomic imprinting, in which one parental allele is switched off. In the case of Phlda2, this is the paternal allele. This raises the intriguing possibility that the father’s genome influences the quality of care that offspring receive from their mothers. Here, we show via genetic manipulation of pup embryos that female mice pregnant with pups carrying the highest dose of Phlda2 favour nest building over caring for their young or themselves. In contrast, dams exposed to the lowest Phlda2 dose while pregnant prioritise nurturing and grooming of their young and personal grooming. These changes in maternal focus suggest the possibility that imprinting of Phlda2 contributed to enhanced maternal care in mammals. This study also presents a unique example of how the genetic makeup of offspring can influence maternal behaviour.","In mammals, mothers provide high-quality maternal care essential for survival and lifelong health of their offspring.

Folding of globular proteins entails a similar discrimination. To gain physical insight, we computed the binding affinities of helical structures of the protein Im9 in various native or nonnative configurations by atomic simulations, discovering that partial packing of the Im9 core is frustrated. This frustration is overcome when the entire core of the protein is assembled, consistent with experiment indicating no significant kinetic trapping in Im9 folding. Our systematic analysis thus reveals a subtle, contextual aspect of biomolecular recognition and provides a general approach to characterize folding frustration.","Biomolecular recognition entails attractive forces functional native states discrimination potential nonnative interactions favor alternate stable configurations.

Most models used to predict mosquito-borne disease transmission incorporate climate data collected at coarser scales than mosquitoes typically experience. Climate conditions can vary greatly between indoor and outdoor environments, and are influenced by landscape features. We conducted a field experiment with the Asian tiger mosquito to explore how microclimate variation across an urban landscape affects mosquito life history and potential to transmit arboviruses, like dengue. We demonstrate that climate conditions captured by weather stations do not reflect relevant mosquito microclimate, and that subtle variation in mean and diurnal ranges of temperature and relative humidity can lead to appreciable variation in key mosquito / pathogen traits that are important for transmission. Our results have implications for statistical and mechanistic models used to predict variation in transmission across seasons, regions, and land uses, but also for building in realistic environmental variation in laboratory work on mosquito-pathogen interactions. Finally, the variation in microclimate we observed across land use was subtle; likely because our study site is a relatively small city.

The smallest capsid protein (SCP) – only 8 kDa molecular mass as compared to the 155 kDa major capsid protein – has been demonstrated to be essential for HCMV growth, but is dispensable in herpes simplex virus type 1. These seemingly contradictory observations have been a paradox. Here, we solve this paradox by high resolution cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM), in conjunction with functional studies using ribozyme inhibition. Our structural comparisons of HCMV virion and capsid reveal molecular interactions at the secondary structure level and suggest that SCP might contribute to capsid binding of pp150, an essential, cytomegalovirus-specific tegument protein. SCP-deficient particles generated by ribozyme inhibition of SCP-expression in HCMV-infected cells show no pp150 tegument density, demonstrating that SCP is required for the functional binding of pp150 to the capsid. Our results suggest that SCP recruits pp150 to stabilize the HCMV nucleocapsid to enable encapsidation of the genome, which is more densely packaged in HCMV than in other herpesviruses.

We are interested in understanding the fundamental processes of how gene expression dynamics within each cell is coupled to the mechanical forces between cells, such that cells move to take up their positions as part of different tissues depending on the genes they express. Recent experiments which track single cell movement and division in conjunction with their gene expression dynamics suggest various hypotheses as to how this coupling functions to pattern the embryo. We have developed a computational model which can test these hypotheses. The model consists of dividing cells, interacting with each other through mechanical forces, within a confinement of embryo boundary. Each cell contains a genetic network of specific genes which influence cell adhesion properties and cell division plane directions. We explicitly simulate the formation of the trophectoderm and endoderm layers of cells which illuminates the principles by which the embryo is robustly patterned.","Mammalian embryogenesis is a dynamic process involving gene expression and mechanical forces of proliferating cells.

In contrast to a single viral lineage spreading across this country, a phylogenetic analysis of the whole-genome sequences of more than 300 influenza A viruses of the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes sampled from the 2006–2007 epidemic season reveals that multiple phenotypically and antigenically distinct viral lineages of entered and co-circulated in the US during this time. Furthermore, the widespread co-circulation of multiple lineages, even in geographically remote localities, allowed for frequent reassortment between influenza A viruses of the same subtype. Through reassortment, a minor lineage of A/H3N2 viruses surprisingly re-acquired sensitivity to the adamantane class of antiviral drugs, and a new A/H1N1 antigenic variant emerged that later became globally dominant. In sum, these results highlight the complexity of the spread of influenza A virus in time and space, and highlight the need for intensified global surveillance involving whole-genome sequence data.","The United States experienced a single epidemic of influenza in 2006–2007, the largest study of its kind undertaken to date.

The latter organelles are hair-like cellular appendages implicated in cell and fluid motility, sensing and transducing information from their environment, and development. Their biogenesis and maintenance depends on a kinesin- and dynein-mediated motility process termed intraflagellar transport (IFT). In addition to comprising these specialized molecular motors, the IFT machinery consists of large multisubunit complexes whose exact composition and organization has not been fully defined. Here we identify a protein, DYF-11/MIP-T3, that is conserved in all ciliated organisms and is associated with IFT in C. elegans. Disruption of C. elegans DYF-11 results in structurally compromised cilia, likely as a result of IFT motor and subunit misassembly. Animals lacking DYF-11 display chemosensory anomalies, consistent with a role for the protein in cilia-associated sensory processes. In zebrafish, MIP-T3 is essential for gastrulation movements during development, similar to that observed for other ciliary components, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins.

Each unit of the repeat contains a copy of the primate-specific DUX4 retrogene, encoding a germline transcription factor that is repressed in somatic tissue. In FSHD, somatic repression of the DUX4 gene is compromised, leading to a variegated expression pattern of DUX4 in muscle cells. The complex (epi)genetic etiology of FSHD has long hampered the generation of a faithful animal model, and thus far the role of FSHD candidate genes has only been studied in model organisms by overexpression approaches. Here we present two transgenic mouse models containing either patient- or control-sized D4Z4 repeats. In our mice, the regulation of the FSHD locus is preserved in both lines, and only in the disease model somatic derepression and variegated expression of DUX4 is observed. These mice thus reflect many aspects of the complex regulation of DUX4 expression in humans. These models may therefore become valuable tools in understanding the in vivo regulation and function of DUX4, its role in FSHD, and the evaluation of therapeutic strategies.","Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4.

They are produced in the presence of infectious agents at body surfaces exposed to the environment. Increasingly, their functional repertoire is expanding, and they have been shown to modulate the immune system. In humans, there is a block of six β-defensin genes that varies in copy number in the population. Individuals with an increased number of β-defensin genes have an increased likelihood of developing the skin autoimmune disease psoriasis. It is not known how this increase in gene copy number influences development of the disease, and psoriasis is a complex interplay of genomic and environmental factors that trigger disease progression and include exposure to viruses. We examined whether a molecular pattern characteristic of viruses produces an altered immune response in the presence of the defensin human β-defensin 3 (hBD3). We find that hBD3 triggers a larger interferon defence response to this viral mimic by increasing accessibility to a cellular receptor that recognises viral patterns. Interferon is known to be important in autoimmunity and our work may explain why individuals with increased β-defensin number are predisposed to develop psoriasis.","Human -defensin 3 (hBD3) is a cationic host defence peptide that plays a key role in the innate immune response to viral infection.

Mtb has to adapt its metabolic needs to the nutritional environment in the host. We investigated the role of glucose phosphorylation and discovered that Mtb expresses two functional glucokinases. Using 13C-tracing experiments we demonstrated that both enzymes are competent to incorporate glucose into central carbon metabolism. In agreement with the view that Mtb metabolizes fatty acids to grow in vivo, both enzymes were dispensable for Mtb replication in mouse lungs and spleens. Surprisingly, however, the glucokinase double mutant was attenuated during the chronic phase of mouse infections. These studies suggest that Mtb metabolizes glucose in vivo and that its survival in chronically infected mice depends on glucose phosphorylation.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the most common cause of tuberculosis in humans.

Comparative genomic analysis of AIV data revealed that the high prevalence of Charadriiformes infected in Delaware Bay is a reservoir of AIV that is phylogenetically distinct from AIV sampled from most North American Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta are representative of the remaining AIV diversity sampled across North America. While AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, our large-scale analysis showed that this population genetic structure was transient and the long-term persistence of AIV was independent of bird flyways. These results suggest an introduced virus lineage may initially be restricted to one flyway, but migration to a major congregation site such as Alberta could occur followed by subsequent spread across flyways. These generalized predictions for virus movement will be critical to assess the associated risk for widespread diffusion and inform surveillance for pandemic preparedness.","Influenza is a major threat to human health and the livestock industry, and the emergence of avian influenza virus (AIV) in wild birds has been linked to the emergence of human livestock influenza (HLI) in the United States and Canada in recent years.

It has long been known that they are highly variable and that this variation is associated with differential risk for autoimmune and infectious diseases. Variant frequencies differ substantially between and even within continents. Determining HLA genotypes is thus an important part of many studies to understand the genetic basis of disease risk. However, conventional methods for HLA typing (e.g. targeted sequencing, hybridisation, amplification) are typically laborious and expensive. We have developed a method for inferring an individual's HLA genotype based on evaluating genetic information from nearby variable sites that are more easily assayed, which aims to integrate heterogeneous data. We introduce two key innovations: we allow for single HLA types to appear on heterogeneous backgrounds of genetic information and we take into account the possibility of genotyping error, which is common within the HLA region. We show that the method is well-suited to deal with multi-population datasets: it enables integrated HLA type inference for individuals of differing ancestry and ethnicity. It will therefore prove useful particularly in international collaborations to better understand disease risks, where samples are drawn from multiple countries.","Imputation of HLA alleles is an important tool for identifying fine-mapping signals in disease association studies.

These specialized T-cells express the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and produce acetylcholine (ACh). Release of ACh in response to neurotransmitters from the sympathetic innervation was previously shown to aberrant immune cell activation, reducing mortality during septic shock. Also, these CD4+ ChAT+ T-cells were previously found to control host-commensal interactions in naïve mice, but their role during enteric bacterial infection was unknown.

Here we introduce a frequency response technique, in which a local periodic perturbation is employed on a flexible loop of a protein, and atomic responses are analyzed. Protein response characteristics are found to be closely related to perturbation frequency, so frequency analysis tools such as power spectral densities and magnitude Bode plots are utilized. Conformational change of the protein estimated by this method is found to be consistent with that determined from crystal structures.

By using a dataset consisting of 13,662 household entomological visits performed in two neighborhoods in Iquitos, Peru, we quantified the ∼3 year spatial clustering patterns of Ae. aegypti among houses and the temporal persistence of vector abundance hotspots. Our results provide strong support for the conclusion that Ae. aegypti distribution is highly focal and that hotspots of high vector abundance at the level of small groups of houses are common, but temporally unstable.

In this study we determined the crystal structure of the HBGA-binding interface of the first Lewis-binder (VA207, GII.9) and compared it with those of the two secretor binders. VA207 binds to the Lewis antigens via the Lewis epitope (α-1, 3 fucose) as the major interacting residue, which is distinct from the two secretor binders that interact with the secretor antigens through the A or H epitope as a major interacting residue. In addition, precursor saccharide was involved in binding and has a role in strain-specificity of VA207. VA207 shares a conserved HBGA binding interfaces with VA387, suggesting a strong selection of human HBGAs in norovirus evolution.

We combine gene synthesis and deep sequencing to generate a high-resolution recombination map of poliovirus, both as a model RNA virus and a continuing threat that has yet to be eradicated. This map shows that recombination is concentrated into hotspots and suggests that predictable and alterable motifs in the RNA sequence are associated with recombination frequency. We demonstrate the utility of these observations by re-designing a poliovirus strain to recombine more frequently than normal, facilitating future studies on the role of viral recombination during infection. This result suggests that a large-scale redesign of the entire poliovirus genome to dampen recombination may be feasible, with implications for producing safer and more stable live vaccines.","Recombination of RNA viruses is an important step in the development of new viral strains that can cause disease.

However, the ability to constantly and rapidly evolve may be selectively adaptive in pathogens due to the constantly changing environment created by the vertebrate immune response. The Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, evades immune detection through a system consisting of numerous unexpressed ‘cassette’ sequences that alter the expressed protein via recombination. Importantly, the potential for evolutionary change in the expressed protein, and thus its ability to repeatedly escape a directed immune response, is correlated with the diversity among the cassettes. We analyzed genetic data from diverse B. burgdorferi strains to test the hypothesis that natural selection favors diversity among the unexpressed cassettes in order to promote evolvability. The data provide significant evidence of natural selection acting to increase among-cassette diversity, but only in regions that are targeted by immune antibodies when expressed. Further, these antigenically-important regions contain mutation-prone DNA sequence structures that are conserved despite high levels of sequence divergence among strains. The empirical evidence of selection favoring mutation-prone sequences and favoring among-cassette diversity supports the hypothesis that natural selection can shape the evolvability of populations.","Evolvability is the ability of a microbial pathogen to adapt to its environment, and the ability of a microbial pathogen to adapt to its environment depends on the ability of a microbial pathogen to adapt to its environment.

The continued rise in antibiotic resistance stresses the need for better insights into the host defense mechanisms associated with pneumococcal pneumonia. The early innate immune response that constitutes bacterial phagocytosis, complement activation and inflammation is critical for the outcome during pneumonia. The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2) has recently been shown to be both a negative regulator of the inflammatory response and a promoter of phagocytosis, but its contribution to pneumonia remains unknown. In our study, we unexpectedly found that alveolar macrophage expressed TREM-2 is detrimental in bacterial phagocytosis and clearance during pneumococcal pneumonia. This occurred via the suppressive effects of TREM-2 on complement component 1q (C1q), an important regulator of bacterial phagocytosis that is crucial for the host response during pneumonia. Thus, targeting the TREM-2 pathway could be used as a novel strategy for modulating C1q production and pulmonary innate immune responses, which could be of clinical relevance during pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections.","Phagocytosis is the inflammation of the lungs that is crucial for the defense of bacterial pneumonia.

However, the role of Th17 cells in protection against S. japonicum infection is still unclear. For the first time, we describe here the changes in Th17 cell levels during S. japonicum infection and suggest that the schistosome egg antigens are primarily responsible for stimulating the generation of host Th17 cells after S. japonicum infection.

In the soil, these fungi grow as mold that produce infectious spores; when inhaled into the warmer lungs of a mammalian host, the spores convert into yeast, which cause infection. The change in shape between mold and yeast is a crucial event in the lifecycle of these fungi. The molecular regulation of this morphologic switch, or phase transition, is poorly understood. The goal of our research was to identify and characterize novel gene(s) that govern the phase transition in dimorphic fungi using Blastomyces dermatitidis as a model organism. Using insertional mutagenesis, we identified a gene, SREB, which encodes a transcription factor that affects phase transition and regulates the production of iron-gathering molecules or siderophores. When SREB is deleted, B. dermatitidis fails to complete the conversion from yeast to mold, grows poorly at environmental temperature, has yellow-orange colony pigmentation, and cannot properly repress the biosynthesis of siderophores.

Both the choice and capacity of DNA repair pathways are tightly regulated in response to environmental cues and cell cycle phase. Recent work has uncovered the importance of protein modifications, such as phosphorylation and sumoylation, in this regulation.

However, it has been unclear for which resection factor sumoylation is important, how sumoylation influences specific attributes of the relevant targets, and how this modification is coordinated with phosphorylation-based regulation. Here, we provide exciting new insights into these issues by revealing that 1) a conserved end resection factor is a SUMO target relevant to this process, 2) this regulation favors a specific repair pathway, 3) sumoylation collaborates with phosphorylation to promote protein solubility, and 4) sumoylation influences DNA repair via an “ensemble effect” that entails simultaneous small alterations of multiple substrates.

Here, we examine an experimental mouse model of chronic bladder infection with uropathogenic E. coli, the most common cause of UTI. We found that the development of chronic bladder infection was preceded by severe bladder tissue inflammation that results in injury to the lining of the bladder. Furthermore, immunodeficient mice that lacked these acute inflammatory responses were protected from chronic bladder infection, suggesting that the development of chronic bladder infection requires immune-mediated tissue damage during acute infection.

Over the past years, such macroscopic rhythms have been suggested to play a crucial role in routing the flow of information across cortical regions, resulting in a functional connectome. The underlying mechanism is cortical oscillations that bind together following a well-known motif called phase-locking. While there is significant experimental support for multiple phase-locking modes in the brain, it is still unclear what is the underlying mechanism that permits macroscopic rhythms to phase lock. In the present paper we take up with this issue, and to show that, one can study the emergent macroscopic phase-locking within the mathematical framework of weakly coupled oscillators. We find that under synaptic delays, fully symmetrically coupled networks can display symmetry-broken states of activity, where one network starts to lead in phase the second (also sometimes known as stuttering states). When we analyse how incoming transient signals affect the coupled system, we find that in the symmetry-broken state, the effect depends strongly on which network is targeted (the leader or the follower) as well as the timing of the input. Hence we show how the dynamics of the emergent phase-locked activity imposes a functional directionality on how signals are processed. We thus offer clarification on the synaptic and circuit properties responsible for the emergence of multiple phase-locking patterns and provide support for its functional implication in information transfer.","Macroscopic oscillations in different brain regions are implicated in persistent time-routing information. Several cellular mechanisms influence network oscillatory dynamics structure of macroscopic firing motifs, key questions are identifyphysical neuronal synaptic properties that permit motifs to arise, and second important issue is different neural activity coherence states determine communication neural circuits. Here, we analyse the emergence of phase-locking bidirectionally delayed-coupled spiking circuits global gamma band oscillations arise synaptic coupling largely between excitable and inhibitory neurons. We derive a phase equation coupled system link between synaptic mechanisms and coherence states system. We show that symmetry-broken coherence states lead to preferred direction signal transfer between oscillatory networks and directionality depends on timing signal.",16.114

These are detectable by surveying for evidence of balancing selection, as previously illustrated in analyses of genes encoding malaria parasite antigens that are candidate targets of naturally acquired immunity. For a comprehensive screen to discover targets of immunity in the major human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, an endemic population in West Africa was sampled and genome sequence data obtained from 65 clinical isolates, allowing analysis of polymorphism in almost all protein-coding genes. Antigen genes previously studied by capillary re-sequencing in independent population samples had highly concordant indices in the genome-wide analysis here, and this has identified other genes with stronger evidence of balancing selection, now prioritized for functional study and potential vaccine candidacy. The statistical signatures consistent with such selection were particularly common in genes with peak expression at the stage that invades erythrocytes, and members of several gene families were represented. The strongest signature was in the msp3-like gene PF10_0355, so we studied the transcript and protein product in parasites, revealing an unexpected pattern of phase variable expression. Variation in expression of polymorphic antigens under balancing selection may be more common than previously thought, requiring further study to assess vaccine candidacy.","Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide.

To stop the spread of LF, a program led by the World Health Organization (WHO) offers annual preventive drug treatment to affected communities. For people who already have lymphedema, WHO recommends simple hygiene-based measures that include skin care and limb movement. Yet only a small proportion of those with LF-related lymphedema have been trained in these measures. To determine the effectiveness of hygiene-based lymphedema management, we reviewed the scientific literature. Twenty-two studies were found that 1) used hygiene-based interventions to manage lymphedema; 2) measured the effect of these interventions; and 3) were done in an area where LF occurs. Overall, use of hygiene-based measures was associated with 60% lower odds of inflammatory episodes, known as “acute attacks,” in the affected limb. Acute attacks cause severe pain, fever, and disability, and they make lymphedema worse. Hygiene and sanitation are necessary for control of many tropical diseases. Hygiene is also effective for managing LF-related lymphedema and reducing suffering caused by acute attacks.

This difference could be caused either by generic differences in the way immunity is acquired or by a relatively higher exposure to P. vivax blood-stage infections in early life. We found that children experienced an average of 14 new P. vivax blood-stage infections per year, and that the number of new infections acquired predicted how often children fell ill with vivax malaria by genotyping all P. vivax infections that occurred in a group of 264 children 1–4 years of age followed for 16 months. The burden of blood-stage infections caused by P. vivax was therefore at least twice as high as that caused by P. falciparum. This higher force-of-blood-stage infection (molFOB) caused by P. vivax is at least partially due to the ability of P. vivax hypnozoites to relapse from long-lasting liver stages. A high exposure to P. vivax blood-stage infection resulted in more rapid decrease in the incidence of P. vivax malaria. The high number of P. vivax clones that infect children in early childhood is thus likely to contribute substantially to the rapid acquisition of immunity against clinical P. vivax malaria.","Plasmodium vivax is a co-endemic parasite that causes malaria in Papua New Guinea.

Here we study the sensing properties of a simple and generic allosteric sensor to understand the effectiveness and limitations of its “design”. We begin by defining and calculating a set of six engineering-inspired characteristics of the sensor’s response and investigate how specifying a high performance in one characteristic constrains the sensor’s performance in others. We determine many such trade-offs and, perhaps surprisingly, that much of the space of characteristics is inaccessible given biophysically plausible ranges of parameters. Our results suggest that allosteric sensors are not under selection for high performance in one sensing characteristic but for a compromise in performance between many. Our approach provides both quantitative and qualitative insights about the function and robustness of allosteric sensors and as such is applicable to both the study of endogenous systems and the design of synthetic ones.","The ability to detect changes in gene expression is one of the most fundamental biological processes in the human body.

One of them is: how homogeneous is AD? Is the course of progression more or less the same for most patients, or are there large variations? Our paper studies a large cohort of AD patients which comes from a 23-year-long study, and performs a statistical analysis of progression speed. We quantify the amount of spread in GDS/FAST stage durations (a staging system widely used by clinicians). We arrive at an astonishing conclusion that the mean length of AD stages is comparable with their standard deviation! This means that individual courses of AD progression may differ very much from each other, and from the textbook mean values. This has implications both for clinical trials (how do we assess if a new drug is effective, if the amount of natural spread is so large in untreated patients?), and for our understanding of this disease, which appears to be comprised of sub-diseases with different patterns of decline.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and is the second leading cause of disability in the world.

This allowed us to identify collections of brain regions where Fos expression co-varies across mice, and presumably form components of a network that are co-active during recall of long-term fear memory. This analysis suggested that expression of a long-term fear memory is an emergent property of large scale neural network interactions.

Heat shock gene activation involves the synthesis of poly-[ADP-ribose] (PAR) at heat shock loci, the opening of chromatin structure, and the coordinated recruitment of transcription factors and chromatin regulators RNA polymerase II and components of the RNA processing machinery. The molecular roles of PAR and and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers in heat shock gene activation are not clear. We show here that the chromatin remodeler dMi-2 is recruited to Drosophila heat shock genes in a PAR–dependent manner. We provide evidence that recruitment involves direct binding of dMi-2 to PAR polymers and identify novel PAR sensing regions in the dMi-2 protein, including the chromodomains and a series of motifs rich in K and R residues. Upon HS gene activation, dMi-2 associates with nascent transcripts. In addition, we find that dMi-2 and its catalytic activity are important for heat shock gene activation and co-transcriptional RNA processing efficiency.

A perfect diagnostic test would detect every infected dog (100% sensitivity) whilst never giving a false positive reaction in non-infected dogs (100% specificity). Since no such test exists, it is important to understand the performance of available diagnostic techniques. We used the results of a study that used three diagnostic tests on dogs from the Tibetan plateau, where there is co-endemicity of E. granulosus and E. multilocularis. In this study opro-antigen ELISA and copro-PCR diagnostic tests were undertaken on faecal samples from all animals. The dogs were also purged with arecoline hydrobromide to recover adult parasites as a highly specific but relatively insensitive third diagnostic test. We used a statistical approach (Bayesian latent-class models) to estimate simultaneously the sensitivities of all three tests and the specificities of the copro-antigen and copro-PCR tests. We also analysed how some determinants of infection can affect parasite prevalence. This approach provides a robust framework to increase the accuracy of surveillance and epidemiological studies of echinococcosis by overcoming the problems of poor diagnostic test performance.","The diagnosis of canine echinococcosis is a challenge to surveillance studies and the perfect gold standard routinely. However, unknown test specificities sensitivities overcome latent-class analysis of appropriate data. In this study, we used faecal purge samples to explore the epidemiology of canine echinococcosis in the Tibetan plateau. Previously, the results of faecal purge samples were reported to be analysed largely on the basis of deterministic way. However, additional diagnostic tests for copro-copro- antigen and species-specific copro-arecoline purgation were undertaken in faecal samples.

In simple eukaryotes, chromosomal loci are preferentially replicated at specific times of S phase, in part because of their differential sensitivity to cell cycle regulators and in part as a result of random choice. Mammals, with ∼250-fold larger genomes, have more complex replication programs, within which different classes of chromatin replicate at defined times. While the basic regulatory mechanisms in higher eukaryotes are conserved, it is unclear how their much more complex timing program is maintained. We use replication precursor analogues, which can be visualized in living or fixed cells, to monitor the spatial relationship of DNA domains that are replicated at different times of S phase. Analyzing individual chromosome, we show that a major mechanism regulating transitions in the S phase timing program involves the sequential activation of replication domains based on their genetic continuity. Our analysis of the mechanism of S phase progression in single cells provides an alternative to genome-wide strategies, which define patterns of replication using cell populations. In combination, these complimentary strategies provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of S phase timing in mammalian cells.","In mammalian cells, DNA synthesis is performed at extreme precision to maintain genomic integrity. However, the molecular principles that define the S phase program are unknown. Here, we show that the S phase is maintained spatially adjacent to the cell cycle.

Some of these effects are the cause of the widespread illicit use of marijuana, while others might be involved in the potential therapeutic use of this drug for the treatment of several neuronal disorders. The great majority of these effects of THC are mediated by cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), which is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system. The exact anatomical and neuronal substrates of each action are, however, not clearly known at the moment. We addressed this issue by using an advanced genetic approach. Control and conditional mutant mice, lacking CB1 expression in defined neuronal subpopulations but not in others, were treated with THC, and typical effects of the drug on motor behaviour, pain, and thermal sensation were scored. Our results show that different neuronal subpopulations mediate different effects of THC and could lead to a refined interpretation of the pharmacological actions of cannabinoids. Moreover, these data might provide the rationale for the development of drugs capable of selectively activating CB1 in specific neuronal subpopulations, thereby better exploiting cannabinoids' potential therapeutic properties.","The main psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), exerts plethora of psychoactive effects in activation of neuronal cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), expressed in different neuronal subpopulations in the central nervous system.

Given the static nature of current pharmaceuticals and vaccines, natural selection inevitably drives pathogens to mutate into drug-resistant variants that can resume productive replication. Further, these drug-resistant mutants transmit across populations, resulting in untreatable epidemics. Recently, a therapeutic strategy was proposed in which viral deletion mutants—termed therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs)—are engineered to only replicate by stealing their missing proteins from full-length viruses in co-infected cells. By stealing essential viral proteins, these engineered molecular parasites have been predicted to reduce viral levels in patients and viral transmission events across populations. Yet, a critical question is whether rapidly mutating viruses like HIV can evolve around TIP control by reducing production of the proteins that TIPs must steal in order to replicate (i.e., by ‘starving’ the TIPs). Here we develop a multi-scale model that tests whether TIP-starving HIV mutants can spread across populations to undermine TIP therapy campaigns at the population-scale. Strikingly, model results show that inherent evolutionary tradeoffs prevent these TIP-resistant HIV mutants from increasing in frequency (i.e., these TIP-resistant HIV mutants are continually outcompeted by TIP-sensitive mutants in both patients and populations). Maintained by natural selection, TIPs may offer a novel therapeutic approach to indefinitely control rapidly evolving viral pandemics.","The rapid evolution of RNA- encoded viruses such as HIV presents a major barrier to infectious disease control of conventional pharmaceuticals vaccines. Previously, proposed defective interfering particles developed indefinitely control HIV/AIDS pandemic; individual patients, engineered molecular parasites predicted to be refractory to HIV mutational escape (i.e. ‘resistance-proof’). However, the outstanding question is whether engineered interfering particles (TIPs) will remain resistance-proof population-scale. TIPs transmit efficiently reaching higher viral loads to TIP-treated subpopulations, and TIP-resistant HIV mutants transmit efficiently reaching higher viral loads to TIP-treated subpopulations. Here, we develop a multi-scale model test TIPs maintain indefinite control of HIV population-scale, HIV (’ unilaterally’) evolves TIP resistance limiting production of viral proteins available to TIPs parasitize, and TIP-resistant HIV mutants show reduced transmission rates to TIP-treated subpopulations, despite increased transmission rates to TIP-treated subpopulations.",15.725000000000001

By studying the evolution of the transferrin receptor, which the virus uses to enter a cell, we discovered that the ancestors of dogs were likely infected by a parvovirus millions of years ago until they evolved and became resistant; this was caused by their transferrin receptor changing so it no longer bound the virus. When a variant virus that infects dogs emerged in the 1970s, it had adapted to overcome this block. This story suggests that diseases which were once eliminated from a species can evolve and regain the infectivity for that host, therefore having high potential to be emerging diseases. We identified features of the receptor that were important to the evolution of this host-virus interaction and confirmed their role in regulating virus binding in cell culture.",Parvoviruses exploit transferrin receptor type-1 (TfR) cellular entry to carnivores for specific interactions that control host range.

TBEV causes febrile illness and encephalitis in humans in forested regions of Europe and Asia. The incidence of TBE is increasing across Central and Eastern European countries despite the availability of several licensed inactivated vaccines and appropriate vaccination programmes. Large-scale codon re-encoding, a recently developed attenuation method that modifies viral RNA nucleotide composition of large coding regions without alteration of the encoded proteins, has been successfully applied to a variety of RNA viruses. In contrast with previous empirical methods of generating live attenuated vaccines, large-scale codon re-encoding facilitates rapid generation of vaccine candidates using reverse genetics methods, by direct control of the attenuation phenotype. Additional benefits include reduced costs and induction of long-term immunity. Here, we have applied the large-scale codon re-encoding method to the TBEV to demonstrate the principle of developing a live attenuated virus vaccine which protects mice against subsequent infection with the wild type virulent virus.

De novo prion appearance can be made very frequent in yeast by transient overexpression of the prion protein in the presence of heterologous prions or prion-like aggregates.

We found considerable colocalization of two heterologous prion/prion-like aggregates with the newly appearing prion protein aggregates, which is consistent with the prevalent model that existing prion aggregates can cross-seed the de novo aggregation of a heterologous prion protein.

Our study combines: (i) simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the brain and muscle; (ii) computational modelling; (iii) mathematical analysis. We found that the network supports oscillations in the tremor range, and the application of high frequency DBS switches this to low amplitude, high-frequency activity. We propose that our model can be used to predict DBS parameter settings that suppress pathological network activity and consequently tremor. In summary, we provide the first population level model of essential tremor including the effect of DBS on network behaviour.","Essential tremor (ET) is a movement disorder characterised by uncontrollable shaking of the affected body. It is characterised by uncontrollable shaking of the affected body. The precise cause of ET is unknown. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a clinical therapy that alleviates symptoms of number movement disorders. DBS involves surgical implantation of electrodes specific to the nucleus of the brain. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in treating ET, but the mechanism of therapeutic effect obtained is not understood. In this study, we used a computational modelling approach combined with electrophysiological data to elucidate the mechanism underlying the pathological network activity effect of DBS activity. We modelled a network hypothesised underlie the ET Wilson- Cowan approach. Applying DBS-like input oscillations to the pathological network exhibited oscillatory behaviour in the tremor frequency range, electrophysiological data. Applying DBS-like input oscillations to the pathological network supported oscillations in the tremor frequency range, mechanism underlying therapeutic benefit.",13.39283815028902

There are two types of Salmonella–Typhi and non-typhoidal (NTS). In humans, the majority of illnesses caused by NTS are related to gastro-intestinal problems, though uncommonly, it also invades the bloodstream. On the other hand, typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi commonly invades the bloodstream. Since the treatment of the two types may differ, we wanted to compare the risk factors for each. We studied patients who had NTS or Typhi isolated from blood in a diarrheal hospital in Bangladesh. We observed that patients with NTS bloodstream infection frequently presented with severe malnutrition, clinically diagnosed sepsis and pneumonia compared to those with typhoid fever. We also found that NTS and Typhi differed in what antibiotics they were sensitive to. These observations may help our clinicians to initiate aggressive treatment from the very beginning of the illness in children with NTS bacteremia in order to attain better outcomes.","Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Mammalian cells encode many poly(A)-specific exoribonucleases, but their individual roles are poorly understood. Here, we undertook an analysis of the role of PARN deadenylase in mouse myoblasts using global measurements of mRNA decay rates. Our results reveal that a discrete set of mRNAs exhibit altered mRNA decay as a result of PARN depletion and that stabilization is associated with increased poly(A) tail length and translation efficiency. We determined that stabilization of mRNAs does not generally result in their increased abundance, supporting the idea that mRNA decay is coupled to transcription. Importantly, knockdown of PARN has wide ranging effects on gene expression that specifically impact the extracellular matrix and cell migration.","The mammalian deadenylase, PARN, plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. However, the role of PARN in regulation of gene expression remains unclear. Here, we performed a global expression half-life analysis of mouse myoblasts depleted of PARN.

Previous studies indicated that the pathway of HIV-1 particle morphogenesis is distinct in primary human macrophages, and this has been suggested to play a role in viral persistence. Early reports indicated that HIV-1 accumulates within apparently intracellular vacuolar structures, which were later identified as being of late endosomal origin. Endosomes were therefore suggested to comprise the budding and storage compartment for HIV-1 in primary human macrophages, from which infectious virus can be released in a regulated manner. In the present study, we show that HIV-1 budding occurs predominantly at the plasma membrane also in primary human macrophages. Using electron microscopy, we observed that the cell surface of macrophages displays an unexpectedly complex morphology with many protrusions and deep invaginations. HIV-1 budding occurs primarily at these invaginations that are clearly connected to the cell surface and do not belong to the endocytic compartment. Mature virus particles can remain trapped within such invaginations giving the appearance of an intracellular budding compartment. These results suggest a general pathway of HIV-1 morphogenesis with the plasma membrane as viral budding site.","The plasma membrane is the primary site of HIV-1 budding in infected macrophages. However, the plasma membrane is not the primary site of HIV-1 budding in primary macrophages.

Longitudinal entomological and human serology data from Iquitos, Peru, were used to test associations between Ae. aegypti indices and the 6-month risk of DENV seroconversion. Our analysis found no association between cross-sectional measures of Ae. aegypti abundance and the risk of DENV seroconversion. Longitudinal measures of Ae. aegypti were better proxies for DENV risk, primarily among adult stage mosquito indicators. DENV transmission is complex and time-varying; the relationship between vector density and risk is not static nor adequately characterized through periodic entomological surveillance. While entomological monitoring will continue to serve a role in the evaluation of vector control interventions (e.g., comparing pre- and post-intervention abundance), our analysis challenges the validity of most Ae. aegypti indicators as adequate proxies for true DENV exposure risk.","Entomological monitoring of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that carries the Zika virus, is a common practice in Latin America.

This study expands our understanding of risk factors for exposure to two common genera of mosquito-borne viruses, alphaviruses and flaviviruses.

Behaviors enhancing or limiting contact with mosquitoes are also significant predictors, as mosquitoes drive transmission.

However, it is clear that these gene signatures do not fully reflect the complexity of human cancer.

We use this approach to analyze hypoxia and lactic acidosis gene signatures to identify latent factors that represent distinct, interacting components of the various biological processes which are in the initial gene signatures but poorly dissected. Some factors are clustered in small chromosomal regions and their expression values are highly correlated with their DNA copy number in both cancer cell lines and human tumors. Therefore, the gene dosage at the DNA levels may explain the differences in gene expression. Several factors contain genes which are known to directly modulate the hypoxia response and allow us to generate testable hypotheses regarding particular copy number changes and hypoxia signatures. Therefore, the use of latent factor analysis is a powerful means to identify pathway-associated changes in the DNA copy number and gene dosage.","Microenvironmental stresses, such as lactic acidosis and hypoxia, play an important role in tumor progression.

It has long been known that the sequence of a protein, which is a string of different amino acids, can dictate how a protein molecule folds into a well-defined shape required for biological tasks. Many folded proteins recognize and bind with each other by a tight geometric fit similar to that between a lock and its key. Recently, however, it has become clear that some proteins function as a flexible string, in constant motion, without forming a stable shape. Understanding how such “disordered” proteins work is challenging. To gain insight, we studied a disordered protein region that causes a large family of human cancers. Employing an innovative combination of experimental and theoretical techniques, we describe a new mode of protein interaction based on multiple simple contacts between one type of amino acid (aromatic) in the disordered protein and another type (positively charged) on the partner protein. Because this mechanism also underlies the ability of the disordered protein to cause cancer, further investigation of this unprecedented mode of protein-protein interaction may open up new avenues for cancer therapy.","Molecular recognition of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) commonly involves specific localized contacts with target-induced disorder order transitions.

In neuroscience, evidence suggests that memory brain regions, such as the hippocampus, are involved in imagining novel situations. We therefore hypothesized that the hippocampus might be critical for evaluating outcomes that we need to imagine. This is typically the case in intertemporal choices, where immediate rewards are considered against future gratifications (e.g., a beer now or a bottle of champagne a week from now). Previous investigations have implicated the dorsal prefrontal cortex brain region in resisting immediate rewards. Here we manipulated the mode of presentation (text or picture), such that options were represented either in simulation or in perception systems. Functional neuroimaging data confirmed that hippocampal activity lends a preference to choosing simulated options (irrespective of time), whereas dorsal prefrontal cortex brain activity supports the preference for delayed options (irrespective of presentation mode). Structural neuroimaging in healthy subjects and in patients with brain atrophy, due to Alzheimer's disease (with hippocampal damage) or Fronto-Temporal Dementia (with damage to the prefrontal cortex), further demonstrated the critical implication of the hippocampus. Individuals with higher neuronal density in the hippocampus, but not in the dorsal prefrontal cortex, were more likely to choose future rewards that have to be mentally simulated.","The hippocampus is a region of the brain involved in memory, learning, and decision-making.

Genetic defects in components of this dystrophin complex are responsible for many forms of muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy. C. elegans possesses the dystrophin complex and mutations in its components cause muscular defects, indicating that the dystrophin complex has an evolutionary conserved role in muscle. Accumulating evidence in mammals indicates that dystrophic muscle exhibits an abnormal calcium homeostasis. It is not clear how defects in the dystrophin complex are linked to calcium homeostasis, however. In a C. elegans genetic study we found that a novel adaptor protein links the dystrophin complex to a calcium-sensitive potassium channel that mediates muscle inactivation. We further demonstrated that both the dystrophin complex and the adaptor protein localize the potassium channel in a close proximity to a muscle-activating calcium channel. This arrangement ensures that calcium increases accompanied by muscle activation are coupled to muscle inactivation. Defects in the dystrophin complex or the adaptor disrupt the localization of the potassium channel, thereby resulting in prolonged muscle activation and calcium ion increases. Our study provides a mechanism by which the dystrophin complex regulates cellular signaling and muscle excitability.","Genetic defects in the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) are responsible for a variety of pathological conditions including muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, and vasospasm.

To this end, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions and simulation tools are indispensable. The choice of the objective function to be used for simulating genome-scale metabolic models is dependent on the biological context and one of the most relevant parameters for successful modeling. Formulation of the intended objective function often requires the use of multiple fluxes, e.g. the sum of fluxes through ATP-producing reactions. We demonstrate that the existing tools confound biological interpretation of the simulations due to undesired dependence on the representation of stoichiometry and propose a new tool – Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl). MiMBl allows casting of the desired biological objective functions into linear optimization models and gives consistent simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations. We demonstrate relevance of MiMBl for addressing biological questions through improved predictions of genetic interactions within the yeast metabolic network. Genetic interactions imply functional relationship between the genes and therefore allow assessing different hypotheses for the underlying biological principles. MiMBl explains several of the genetic interactions as outcome of flux re-routing for minimal metabolite turnover adjustments.","metabolic networks provide a comprehensive structural framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships in flux simulations.

Yeast RAD9 was the first DNA damage checkpoint gene identified. The genetic tools available in this model system allow to address relevant questions to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the Rad9 biological function. By chromatin-binding and domain-swapping experiments, we found that Rad9 is recruited into DNA both in unperturbed and in DNA–damaging conditions, and we identified the molecular determinants required for such interaction. Moreover, the extent of chromatin-bound Rad9 is regulated during the cell cycle and influences its role in checkpoint activation. In fact, the checkpoint function of Rad9 in G1 cells is solely mediated by its interaction with modified histones, while in M phase it occurs through an additional scaffold protein, named Dpb11. Productive Rad9-Dpb11 interaction in M phase requires Rad9 phosphorylation by CDK1, and we identified the Ser11 residue as the major CDK1 target. The model of Rad9 action that we are presenting can be extended to other eukaryotic organisms, since Rad9 and Dpb11 have been conserved through evolution from yeast to mammalian cells.","Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad9 is required for DNA damage response in response to cell cycle.

From April to September 2009, countries in temperate regions of the Southern hemisphere experienced large epidemics of H1N1pdm during their winter season, with the new virus quickly becoming the predominant circulating influenza strain. We use mathematical modelling to analyse H1N1pdm epidemiological data from 8 southern hemisphere countries. We aim at understanding better the factors which may have influenced virus transmission in these countries. We find that transmissibility of the virus was relatively low compared with previous influenza pandemics, largely because of strong pre-existing age-dependent susceptibility to the virus (older people being less susceptible to infection, perhaps due to pre-existing immunity). We suggest that population demography had a strong impact on the virus spread and that higher transmission rates occurred in countries having a younger population. Our results highlight the requirement to use age-structured models for the analysis of influenza epidemics and support the need for country-specific analyses to inform the design of control policies for pandemic mitigation.",Pandemic H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm) was introduced into the Northern and Southern hemispheres in the winter of 2009.

Virus spreads from infected cells to surrounding uninfected host cells to develop infection through cell-free and cell-cell transmission routes. Understanding the spread of resistant virus is important for the development of novel antiviral strategies to prevent and treat antiviral resistance. Here, we characterize the spread of resistant viruses and its impact for emergence and prevention of resistance using HCV as a model system. Our results show that cell-cell transmission is the main transmission route for antiviral resistant HCV strains and is crucial for the maintenance of infection. Monoclonal antibodies or small molecules targeting HCV entry factors are effective in inhibiting the spread of resistant HCV in cell culture models and thus should be evaluated clinically for prevention and treatment of HCV resistance. Combination of inhibitors targeting viral entry and clinically used direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) prevents antiviral resistance and leads to viral eradication in cell culture models.

A complex cellular pathway involving the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is typically required for the loading of peptides onto HLA class I molecules, and for effective anti-viral immunity mediated by cytotoxic T cells. Many viruses encode inhibitors of TAP as a means to evade anti-viral immunity by cytotoxic T cells. In humans, there are three sets of genes encoding HLA class I molecules, which are the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genes. These genes are highly variable, with thousands of allelic variants in human populations. Most individuals typically express two variants of each gene, one inherited from each parent. We demonstrate that about 15% of tested HLA-B allotypes have higher resistance to viral inhibitors of TAP or deficiency of TAP, compared to other HLA-B variants. HLA-B allotypes that are more resistant to TAP inhibition are expected to induce stronger CD8+ T cell responses against pathogens that inhibit TAP.

Here I introduce two new genome-wide, pairwise indices for quantifying the propensity of microbial species to interact with each other. The first measure quantifies similarity in genome composition between two microbes. The second measure summarizes the topology of a protein functional association network built for a given pair of microbes and quantifies the fraction of network edges crossing organismal boundaries. I then study the ability of two newly proposed and two previously reported indices to explain variation in microbial co-occurrence. All four measures are significantly correlated with co-occurrence of microbes even when accounting for evolutionary relationships between the species. One of the newly developed indices outperforms previously proposed ones and explains up to 3.5% of the variance in co-occurrence. In summary, the indices described here are able to detect ecological associations between species using only their genomic information; however, additional methods are needed to provide more reliable genomic tools for microbial ecology.","Microbial genomes contain a large amount of information about their environment, but the extent to which this information can be used to explain the phenotypic properties of microbes is largely unknown.

The consequence is enhanced long-term survival by facilitating persistence and evasion of the host immune system. Salmonella sp., cause severe infections in a range of mammalian hosts and guard themselves with a protective coat, termed the O-antigen. Through genome sequence analyses we found that Salmonella have acquired an unprecedented repertoire of genetic sequences for modifying their O-antigen coat. There is strong evidence that these genetic factors have a dynamic evolutionary history and are spread through the bacterial population by bacteriophage. In addition to this genetic repertoire, we determined that Salmonella can and often do employ stochastic mechanisms for expression of these genetic factors. This means that O-antigen coat diversity can be generated within a Salmonella population that otherwise has a common genome. Our data significantly enhance our appreciation of the genetic and regulatory characteristics underpinning Salmonella O-antigen diversity. The role attributed to bacteriophage in generating this diversity highlights that Salmonella are acquiring an extensive repertoire of O-antigen modifying traits that may enhance the pathogen's ability to persist and cause disease in mammalian hosts. Such genetic traits may make useful markers for defining new epidemiological and diagnostic tools.","Salmonella is the most common cause of food poisoning in the United States and is the leading cause of food-borne illness in children under 5 years of age.

Among the nonstructural proteins of enteroviruses or picornaviruses, protein 2CATPase is the most conserved and complex but the least understood. On the basis of sequence analyses, this protein has been predicted as a putative superfamily 3 (SF3) helicase that supposedly plays a pivotal role in enteroviral RNA replication. However, attempts to determine the helicase activity associated with 2CATPase have been unsuccessful. We found that eukaryotically expressed EV71 or CAV16 2CATPase does possess an ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that 3′→5′ unwinds RNA helices like other SF3 helicases; surprisingly, it also functions as an RNA chaperone that remodels RNA structures in an ATP-independent manner. Moreover, we determined the domain requirements for these two RNA remodeling activities associated with 2CATPase and provide both in vitro and cellular evidence of their potential roles during viral RNA replication.

Recent molecular genetics advances in angiosperms revealed that transcriptional regulation is critical for auxin response. Although auxin response was also observed in charophytes, a class of green algae related to land plants, and bryophytes, little is known how plants acquired auxin signaling components during evolution. Recently, it was reported that a filamentous charophycean alga, Klebsormidium flaccidum, does not have auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation, suggesting its evolution around land adaptation of plants. Here, we revealed that a liverwort species, Marchantia polymorpha, has a simplified but complete auxin-mediated transcription mechanism compared with other land plant species. Despite the minimal auxin system, M. polymorpha exhibited pleiotropic auxin responses in morphogenesis including roles in organ differentiation and cell elongation. Phylogenetic and experimental analyses revealed that the three ARF transcription factors in M. polymorpha had different transcriptional activities and interacted in various combinations with different affinities. This suggests that the auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation was established in the common ancestor of land plants, and might be correlated with the change in body plans at this time in the evolution of land plants.","auxin is a plant hormone that regulates aspects of plant growth and development.

It is used within cells to regulate many essential processes and, because of this, its cellular concentration is tightly controlled. To change cellular calcium levels, cells use calcium transport proteins. These proteins can alter calcium concentration by moving calcium into or out of the cell or specialised calcium storage compartments within the cell. We know little about how single-celled apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium (the causal agent of malaria) and Toxoplasma (the causal agent of toxoplasmosis), regulate their calcium levels. Here, we have demonstrated that removing apicomplexan genes for a protein that exchanges calcium for protons across membranes (a Ca2+/H+ exchanger) and a member of the cation exchanger (CAX) family, does not affect the survival of parasites during those stages when they live within host cells. It is, however, lethal for the mouse malaria P. berghei when the parasite is free living within its mosquito vector. When we removed calcium from around the parasites at this stage they were able to develop normally, suggesting that the protein provides a mechanism for the parasite to tolerate environmental calcium. Learning how this calcium transport protein impacts on the development of apicomplexan parasites may lead to the development of novel anti-parasitic interventions.","The Ca2+/H+ exchanger (CAX) family is a family of Ca2+/H+ exchanger proteins involved in the homeostatic control of apicomplexans, Plasmodium Toxoplasma berghei and T. gondii.

In this article, we propose a learning system that combines the autonomous extraction of important information from the sensory input with reward-based learning. The extraction of salient information is learned by exploiting the temporal continuity of real-world stimuli.

These base-pairing interactions are stabilizing, and the RNA will tend to fold in a particular way to maximize stability. Consider some nucleotide sequence that optimally folds into some structure in isolation; if this sequence is now embedded inside a larger sequence, then either the original structure will be a robust subcomponent of the larger folded structure, or it will be disrupted due to new interactions between the original sequence and the surrounding sequence. We explore this property of context robustness of structure and in particular define the property of “self containment” to describe intrinsic context robustness—i.e., the tendency for certain sequences to be structurally robust in many different sequence contexts. Self containment turns out to be a strong characteristic of a class of RNAs called microRNAs, whose biogenesis process depends on the maintenance of structural robustness. This finding will be useful in future efforts to characterize novel miRNAs, as well as in understanding the regulation and evolution of noncoding functional RNAs as modular units.","RNA molecules are the building blocks of many biological processes, including cell division, replication, and gene expression. RNA molecules are composed of two pairs of single strands, each with a pair of folding bases. The secondary structure of RNA molecules depends on the surrounding sequence, and the secondary structure of functional RNAs is composed of fusion independent substructures. In this study, we show that the self-containment index of RNAs is robustly adopted in the secondary structure of RNAs, regardless of the length of the sequence. We show that the self-containment index of RNAs exhibits a trend higher than that of functional RNAs, suggesting that novel novel RNAs acquire new genomic contexts. We also show that the self-containment index of RNAs exhibits a trend higher than that of functional RNAs, suggesting that novel RNAs acquire new genomic contexts.",12.688684210526315

However, most methods for interpreting data from X-ray crystallography focus on building a single structure of the protein, which limits the potential for biological insights. Here we introduce an improved algorithm for using crystallographic data to model these multiple conformations that addresses two previously overlooked types of protein backbone flexibility: peptide flips and glycine movements. The method successfully models known examples of these types of multiple conformations, and also identifies new cases that were previously unrecognized but are well supported by the experimental data. For example, we discover glycine-driven peptide flips in the inhibitor-gating “flaps” of the drug target HIV protease that were not modeled in the original structures. Automatically modeling “hidden” multiple conformations of proteins using our algorithm may help drive biomedically relevant insights in structural biology pertaining to, e.g., drug discovery for HIV–1 protease and other therapeutic targets.","Proteins are composed of a large number of different conformations, each of which performs a specific function. However, the movement of these different conformations within the native ensemble is not well understood. To address this problem, we have developed a computational program called qFit, which uses mixed integer programming (MIQP) to evaluate a large number of combinations of alternative backbone conformations. We find that peptide flips in glycine conformations fall stereotypically in clusters enriched with glycine residues n+1. We find that peptide flips in glycine conformations exemplified HIV protease, and different inhibitors associated with peptide flips “flap” regions adjacent to inhibitor binding site. Our results paint a picture of peptide flips conformational switches, enabled by glycine flexibility, and result in dramatic local rearrangements.",13.401428571428571

We demonstrated here a metabolic enzymatic cascade dependent on a host-pathogen interaction that determines potency against T. brucei of a series of benzoxaborole compounds. More importantly, this pathway represents a metabolic interaction network between host and pathogen, illuminating an important perspective on understanding mechanism of action.","African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is one of the most devastating neglected tropical diseases in the world.

Our study revealed an unexpected high proportion of splicing mutations in MLH1 exon 10 mostly affecting potential exonic splicing regulatory elements (ESRs), which are typically difficult to predict by using in silico tools. We then used five experimental datasets (MLH1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CFTR and NF1) to evaluate the predictive power of 3 in silico approaches recently described for pinpointing ESR-mutations.

Our idea is to construct allelic scores that explain greater proportions of the variance in biological intermediates than single markers, and then use these scores to data mine genome-wide association studies. We show how allelic scores derived from known variants as well as allelic scores derived from hundreds of thousands of genetic markers across the genome explain significant portions of the variance in body mass index, levels of C-reactive protein, and LDLc cholesterol, and many of these scores show expected correlations with disease.

They also perform a range of immune modulatory functions which regulate the immune response to pathogens, ensuring that the protective inflammatory response is not exacerbated and that post-infection repair mechanisms are initiated. We identified a novel family of molecules secreted by medically-important helminth pathogens (termed helminth defence molecules; HDMs) that exhibit striking structural and biochemical similarities to the HDPs. To further investigate the extent of this similarity, we have performed a comparative functional study between several well characterized, anti-microbial, mammalian HDPs and a series of parasite-derived peptides. The parasite HDMs displayed immune modulatory properties that were similar to their HDP homologs in mammals, but possessed no antimicrobial or cytotoxic activity. We propose that HDMs of these helminth pathogens underwent specific adaptation, losing their anti-microbial activity but retaining their ability to regulate the immune responses of their mammalian hosts. This absence of cytotoxicity and retention of immune-modulatory activity offers an opportunity to design novel immunotherapeutics derived from the HDMs which could be used to combat destructive inflammatory responses associated with microbial infection and immune-related disorders.","Host defence peptides (HDPs) are proteins that are secreted by the host to defend the host against infectious agents.

By examining over 50,000 individuals, from 11 different diseases we show that mitochondrial DNA variants can both increase or decrease an individual's risk of disease, replicating and expanding upon several previously reported studies. Moreover, by analysing several large disease groups in tandem, we are able to show a commonality of association, with the same mitochondrial DNA variants associated with several distinct disease phenotypes. These shared genetic associations implicate a shared underlying functional effect, likely changing cellular energy, which manifests as distinct phenotypes.

We show that many types of nonbiological networks can be easily separated based on structural properties, whereas determining the type of interaction represented by an ecological networks is harder. We therefore turn this problem into a challenge for the scientific community. We argue that solving this problem would greatly benefit the field, and we discuss what the consequences of a failure might be.","Ecologists have been compiling ecological networks of the past century, detailing interactions between species and ecosystems. The end of the century, built networks of mutualistic (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal) and antagonistic (e.g., herbivory, parasitism) interactions are to be described. The type of interaction represented in the network is believed to be reflected in the structure of the network. However, the type of interaction represented in the network is not always the same as the type of interaction represented in the structure of the network. In this paper, we show that it is easy to separate different kinds of nonecological networks from ecological networks, making it difficult to distinguish mutualistic and antagonistic interactions.",14.700769230769232

These fusion protein complexes function autonomously to co-ordinately regulate virus–cell attachment and subsequent membrane merger. In contrast, the reovirus Fusion-Associated Small Transmembrane (FAST) proteins are the only example of virus-encoded cellular fusogens, specifically designed to mediate cell–cell rather than virus–cell membrane fusion. In view of their small size, it was unclear if, or how, the FAST proteins are responsible for promoting the membrane attachment and close apposition stages of the fusion reaction. We now show that the FAST proteins have specifically evolved to function as the fusion component in a biphasic cell–cell fusion reaction, where the membrane attachment and membrane merger stages represent two distinct, uncoupled phases. Exploiting cadherins as surrogate adhesins, the FAST proteins have retained within their rudimentary structures the minimal determinants required to convert pre-existing adherens junctions into sites of cell–cell membrane fusion. These results raise the interesting possibility that other, yet to be identified cellular fusion proteins may resemble the FAST proteins, using separate adhesins and less complex fusion proteins in a similar biphasic membrane fusion reaction.","Reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins function as virus- encoded cellular fusogens, mediating efficient cell-cell virus-cell membrane fusion.

Though often considered genomic parasites, these elements also occasionally create novel genes that prove beneficial to the host, a process called 'domestication'. Here, we describe the evolution of a gene, L1TD1, which is derived from the protein-coding regions of the L1 mobile element family. We show that L1TD1 was born in the common ancestor of placental mammals. L1TD1 expression in stem cells and its requirement to maintain the pluripotent state of human embryonic stem cells suggested it might have been originally domesticated for such a pluripotency role. We find that L1TD1's evolution does not fit with the predictions of this model; in fact, L1TD1 has rapidly evolved in primates and mice and has been lost several times in mammals. We suggest an alternate model that L1TD1 was born as a means to defend genomes against transposable elements, perhaps L1 itself. We propose that following this initial domestication, L1TD1 later became incorporated into pluripotency programs in some mammalian lineages.","Mammalian genomes consist of active retroelements, which comprise active retroelements.

An emerging insight is that changes in behavior are associated with massive changes in gene expression in the brain, but we know relatively little about how these changes are regulated. One important class of gene regulators are transcription factors (TF), proteins that orchestrate the expression of tens to thousands of genes. We discovered that ultraspiracle (USP), a TF previously known primarily for its role in development, regulates behavioral change in the honey bee; and we show that USP causes behaviorally related changes in gene expression by mediating responses to an endocrine regulator, juvenile hormone. We present evidence that these effects on gene expression occur through combinatorial interactions between USP and other TFs, and that these hormonally related transcriptional networks are preserved between two tissues with causal roles in behavioral plasticity: the brain and the fat body, a peripheral nutrient-sensing organ. These results suggest that behavior is subserved by complex interactions between genes and gene networks, occurring both in the brain and in peripheral tissues. More generally our results suggest that molecular systems biology is a promising paradigm by which to understand the mechanistic basis for behavior.","We have long known that changes in gene expression are associated with large-scale changes in animal phenotypes, but little is known about how these changes are regulated.

Pathology coincides with egg production, which is started upon pairing of the dioeciously living adults. A constant pairing contact is required to induce mitoses and differentiation processes in the female leading to the development of the gonads. Although long known, the molecular processes controlling gonad development or egg-production in schistosomes or other platyhelminths are largely unknown.

Here we assessed the ability of patient-specific pulse wave propagation modeling to correctly identify high cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients. We performed pulse wave analysis (PWA) in patients on hemodialysis and in healthy subjects. Recorded peripheral pressure profiles were simultaneously used to inform subject-specific mathematical model of pulse wave propagation.

The ability of P. aeruginosa to form biofilms is thought to contribute to their ability to cause chronic infections. The aim of this research was to develop a simple biofilm model of infection using the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The immune system of the fruit fly has similarities with the vertebrate innate immune system. Understanding how P. aeruginosa causes infections in Drosophila will aid in understanding virulence mechanisms in mammals. In this study we show that feeding P. aeruginosa to Drosophila results in a biofilm infection and biofilm infections induced expression of antimicrobial peptide immune response genes in the fly.

N. fowleri can act as an opportunistic pathogen causing severe brain injury called Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), often in healthy children and young adults. With a fatality rate over 97%, N. fowleri is considered one of the most deadly human pathogens. Despite the fact that precious lives are lost annually, N. fowleri infection is rare and economic incentives to invest in development of anti-PAM drugs by the pharmaceutical industry are lacking. In the absence of economic inducements, drug ‘repurposing’ is a cost effective strategy for re-profiling known drugs for the treatment of neglected diseases.

Carrying out biochemical studies and x-ray-crystallography of the target enzyme, we demonstrated that azole anti-fungal drugs, known as conazoles, disrupt sterol biosynthesis in amoebae by competing with the natural substrate for binding in the active site of the sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51).

Many of these interactions are mediated by the binding of relatively short unstructured polypeptide segments, or peptides, in one protein to well-folded domains in other proteins. Such protein-peptide interactions have some interesting and special properties, e.g., promiscuity, which means many different peptide sequences are able to bind the same protein domain. Peptides also often exhibit structural flexibility even after binding a protein. These special properties make it desirable, but also challenging, to simulate protein-peptide binding in atomistic detail for many different peptide sequences. To this end, we have developed a computational algorithm that simultaneously explores the structure of protein-peptide complexes and the amino acid sequences of the peptide. In particular, our algorithm allows binding-competent peptide sequences to be generated in direct relation to their binding strengths. We also explored the possibility of using our method to locate new peptide-binding pockets on protein structures. Computational algorithms such as the one developed here may pave the way to reveal the full complexity of protein-protein interaction networks used in cells.","The binding of short peptides to globular protein domains is important for a wide range of cellular processes, including signal, protein transport, and the immune response.

In the early 2000s, a massive insecticide-spraying program was set up to control dwelling infestation by the blood-sucking bugs that transmit the disease. Here we provide a detailed assessment of the effects of this program in the Department of Cochabamba, one of the most highly-endemic settings worldwide. Our analyses show that municipality-level dwelling infestation rates plummeted from over 70–80% in 2001–2003 to about 2–3% in 2004–2011. This residual infestation was higher in the capital city and, more generally, in municipalities where montane dry forests dominate – probably because wild populations of the main vector, Triatoma infestans, are common in that eco-region. Despite the impressive early achievements of the program, with about 0.5 million people protected from contagion, sustained disease control will require fully operational long-term surveillance systems.","Chagas disease is a highly-endemic vector-borne disease that is endemic in Bolivia.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides a genome-scale map of TF-binding. However, a quantitative characterization of the impact of genome accessibility on TF-binding in bacteria remains elusive. In order to help recruit or block gene expression, TFs must have physical access to regulatory regions. This paper presents a thermodynamics model that describes TF-binding in terms of genome accessibility and binding site affinity. We apply this model in a ChIP-seq dataset for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and observed that genome accessibility is critical to our understanding of TF-binding in vivo. This new model provides practical applications, such as de novo prediction of TF-binding peaks and a framework to measure DNA accessibility from ChIP-seq data. Our model enables us to quantify the relationship of genome accessibility with genomic features and suggest mechanisms that influence genome accessibility in vivo (e.g. distance to oriC).

Innovations that were critical to this transition were the evolution of a weight bearing pelvis, hindlimbs and their associated musculature, and the development of the “rear wheel drive” strategy that predominates in terrestrial locomotion. The fossil record can reveal how the skeletal framework of the load-bearing limbs of tetrapods (animals descended from fish) has evolved, but as soft tissues are rarely preserved within the fossil record, it can shed little light on how the accompanying dramatic alterations of the limb musculature arose developmentally. To examine this question we determined the mechanisms that generate fin muscles within larvae of living species representing several clades of fish across the vertebrate phylogeny. Using this comparative approach and a novel somite transplantation technique in zebrafish, we determine that the pelvic fin muscles of bony fish are generated by a bimodal mechanism that has features of limb/fin muscle formation in tetrapods and primitive cartilaginous fish. Using these data, we propose a unifying evolutionary hypothesis on the origins of the muscle of the paired fins and limbs, and speculate that the adoption of tetrapod mode of hindlimb muscle formation was also an evolutionary innovation critical to the success of the tetrapod transition.","Locomotor strategies evolved in terrestrial tetrapods to utilise sinus contractions and musculature to provide propulsive force.

Understanding the genetic mechanisms controlling arthropod susceptibility to pathogens has profound implications for developing novel strategies for controlling insect-transmitted infectious diseases. Although it was postulated that apoptosis (a genetically controlled form of cellular suicide) may play a very important role in insect innate immunity against viral infection, direct evidence has been lacking due to the lack of knowledge on the regulatory pathways responsible for the induction of apoptosis following viral infection. In this study, we found that there is a rapid induction of pro-apoptotic genes within 1–3 hours of exposure to virus. This rapid pro-apoptotic response was only observed in live animals but not in cultured cells. Genetic analysis indicated that animals lacking this rapid pro-apoptotic response were hypersensitive to viral infection.

About a third of the DNA sites we found to be occupied by FoxA in the adult liver are at genes that are silent. Analysis of transcription factor binding motifs near the FoxA sites at silent genes revealed a co-occurrence of motifs for the transcriptional repressors Rfx1 and type II nuclear hormone receptors (NHR-II). Further analysis of one such region downstream of the Cdx2 gene shows that it is a cryptic enhancer, in that it functions poorly unless Rfx1 or NHR-II binding is prevented, in which case FoxA1 promotes enhancer activity. Cdx2 encodes a transcription factor that promotes intestinal differentiation; ectopic expression of Cdx2 in the esophagus can help promote metaplasia and cancer. By screening numerous staged samples of human tissues, we show that Rfx1 expression is extinguished during the progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma and thus may serve as a marker of cancer progression. These studies exemplify how the analysis of pioneer factors bound to silent genes can reveal a basis for the competence of cells to deregulate gene expression and undergo transitions to cancer.","The expression of genes is regulated by a number of transcription factors, including the transcription factor FoxA. However, it is not known whether these transcription factors are competent to activate silent genes. Here, we performed a genomic analysis of FoxA-bound sites near silent genes, including genes detectable by RNA II. We found that most of the FoxA-bound silent sites are conserved, suggesting that FoxA may function as a transcription factor. We also found that Rfx1, a type II nuclear hormone receptor, is a target of a cryptic “shadow” subset of the C2 gene downstream of the C2 promoter region. We found that Rfx1 expression in the epithelium is gradually extinguished in the progression of Barrett adenocarcinoma. We propose that decreased expression of Rfx1 is an indicator of the progression of Barrett adenocarcinoma.",10.754362934362934

EBV infection has latent and lytic forms. Both forms of infection contribute to the oncogenic capacity of the virus. During the lytic cycle, a cascade of temporally regulated events takes place leading to release of new virus particles. A crucial event in the lytic cascade is expression of the class of EBV late genes, which occurs after viral genome amplification. Late genes mainly encode virus structural proteins that are essential for virus transmission. For many years, the mechanisms regulating expression of late genes remained unknown. Recently, a set of proteins that control expression of late genes was discovered. These proteins form a unique viral pre-initiation complex (vPIC), which initiates synthesis of late gene mRNAs. To this day we have yet to fully understand the process by which assembly of vPIC is synchronized to result in a functional transcription machinery. In this report, we demonstrated that BGLF3, a component of vPIC, is modified by phosphorylation during the lytic phase of the viral life cycle. Phosphorylation of BGLF3 is essential for the ability of the protein to interact with two other components of vPIC, BFRF2 and BVLF1. Our results show that formation of the BGLF3, BFRF2 and BVLF1 complex is integral for synthesis of viral structural proteins. This report establishes the importance of post-translational modifications in regulating the function of vPIC in synthesis of herpesvirus structural proteins. Our findings have the potential to promote the discovery of new anti-viral drugs that inhibit assembly and release of oncogenic herpesviruses.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of the most common herpesviruses in the world. EBV proteins express late kinetics, which are crucial for the formation of virus particles and attachment to host cells. Recently, we identified a group of Epstein-Barr virus early proteins that form pre-initiation complex (vPIC) dedicated to transcription of late genes. However, the role of post-translational modifications in regulating the assembly function of the vPIC complex remains unclear. Here, we show that threonine 42 (T42) is conserved in the BGLF3 protein and that T42 is required for the assembly of the vPIC complex. Abolishing T42 markedly reduced expression of vPIC-dependent late genes, disrupted production of new virus particles, and viral DNA replication, expression of vPIC-independent late genes, and expression of vPIC-independent late genes. Abolishing T42 also suppressed the expression of late genes associated with BGLF3(T42A) and BGLF3(T42A).

The need for rabies control among striped skunks is, however, well acknowledged, and reports of occasional spill-over of skunk variant rabies viruses to non-reservoir species, including some domestic animals, remains a cause for public health concern and a major roadblock for eradicating rabies from North America. An understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of diseases is important in management and for setting future research agendas, and such knowledge could assist in effective striped skunk rabies control. In this study, we evaluated whether rabies among striped skunk cases submitted for testing in the North Central Plains exhibit discernable spatial and temporal patterns, and if there are any eco-climatic factors that influenced such patterns. Our findings indicate that the year-to-year and spatial origins of rabies incidences in the states of Kansas and Nebraska in the North Central Plains are currently stable, and certain physical environment (developed low-intensity areas and patch fragmentation) and climatic (diurnal temperature range) factors play an important role in determining such temporal and spatial patterns.","In North America, striped skunks are important terrestrial reservoirs of rabies virus, and the prevalence of rabies host passively monitored disease host remains largely unmanaged.

Parent-of-origin effects might contribute to the ‘missing heritability’ and involve genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance. Our study is the first that establishes (i) the magnitude and (ii) the type of parent-of-origin effects in the pathogenesis of a multiple sclerosis-like disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rat, using a strategy designed to identify genes that confer risk only when inherited from either mother or father. A striking 37-54% of all risk loci depended on parental origin. Accounting for parent-of-origin enabled more powerful and precise identification of novel risk factors for EAE, such as the imprinted Dlk1gene. Disease-predisposing alleles conferred lower Dlk1 expression in rats and transgenic Dlk1 mice demonstrated that lower Dlk1 drives more severe EAE and modulates adaptive immune responses. Because parental-origin effects are epigenetically regulated, our data implicate a contributory role for epigenetic mechanisms in complex diseases.

These target cells are very often rival bacteria, allowing the T6SS-wielding bacteria to outcompete other pathogens or harmless bacteria. Some bacteria deploy this weapon defensively, only firing back at aggressive cells that have attacked them. Many others use it offensively, firing their T6SS pre-emptively, irrespective of whether they have been attacked by other cells. This work aimed to discover how the activity of the T6SS is controlled in offensive bacteria compared with defensive bacteria, and how this regulation facilitates efficient killing of targeted bacteria. To do this, we studied the offensive anti-bacterial T6SS of Serratia marcescens, a pathogen causing hospital-acquired infections. We found that offensive and defensive bacteria use similar regulatory pathways to activate their T6SSs efficiently, by controlling assembly of the basic machinery and allowing time for the machine to re-position around the cell between firing events. However, the sensing proteins feeding into the regulatory pathways are different and we were able to identify a new offensive input protein.

In these models, animals are treated as moving (self-propelled) particles that interact with each other according to simple rules. Recently, researchers have shown greater interest in using experimental data to verify which rules are actually implemented by a particular animal species. In our study, we present a rigorous selection between alternative models inspired by the literature for a system of glass prawns. We find that the classic theoretical models do not accurately predict either the fine scale or large scale behaviour of the system. Instead, individual animals appear to be interacting even when completely separated from each other. To resolve this we introduce a new class of models wherein prawns ‘remember‚ their previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour.

We show a unique population code for the experience-dependent value of the context. We present evidence that the accumulation of the place fields mediates the learning of the reward context of the environment. Our data reveal that the causal link between place field distribution and behavioral place preference is mediated by the tegmental dopaminergic activity. Optogenetic control of the ventral tegmental area demonstrates that dopaminergic signaling integrates the encoding of location and reward from hippocampal neurons.

In this article, we address the question: Which nodes in a social network should be selectively monitored to detect and monitor outbreaks as early and accurately as possible? We derive best-case performance scenarios, and show that a practical strategy for data collection–recruiting friends of randomly selected individuals–is expected to perform reasonably well, in terms of the timing and reliability of the epidemiological information collected.","Public health agencies are increasingly relying on social networks to monitor infectious disease outbreaks and to identify individuals at high risk of infection.

The many feedback loops created by these interactions can lead to oscillatory behavior. Examples of oscillations in biology include the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, the electrical activity of excitable cells, and predator-prey systems. While we understand how negative feedback loops can cause oscillations, when multiple feedback loops are present it becomes difficult to identify the dominant mechanism(s), if any. We address the problem of establishing the relative contribution of a feedback process using a biological oscillator model for which oscillations are controlled by two types of slow negative feedback. To determine which is the dominant process, we first use standard experimental methodologies: either passive observation to correlate a variable's behavior to system activity, or deletion of a component to establish whether that component is critical for the system. We find that these methods have limited applicability to the determination of the dominant process. We then develop a new quantitative measure of the contribution of each process to the oscillations. This computational method can be extended to a wide variety of oscillatory systems.","Biological systems are characterized by high number of interacting components. The interplay of positive and negative feedback promotes bistability in high low activity, and slow negative feedback switches system high low activity states. Biological oscillators include types of negative feedback processes: divisive (decreases gain positive feedback loop), subtractive (increases input threshold) and contribute slowly to system high-low-activity states. We use a neural network model to determine the relative contribution type of negative feedback process to rhythmic activity and to control the active silent phase equally. We find that passive observation correlate variations in variable interest system behavior, the deletion component establish component critical system. Instead, we develop a computational measure of contribution process, evaluating sensitivity of active (high activity) and silent (low activity) phase durations in time constant process. We show that processes control active phase, proportion of speed relative to weight, and contribute slowly to system high-low-activity states.",16.426578073089704

Some of the most interesting ones are G-quadruplexes (G4)—compact DNA structures in which guanines assemble into multilayered tetrads, and whose formation has been reported at the ends of linear chromosomes (telomeres) and at different regulatory regions of the genome. Although structural and basic energetic properties, as well as some biological functions of G-quadruplexes are quite well understood, not much is known about their propensity to form agregated structures. A very high density of G-quadruplexes at telomeres along with their large exposed planar surfaces indeed favor G4 aggregation through end-to-end stacking, which might be important for the protection of telomeres and DNA packaging. In this research, using computer simulations, we provide insight into moleculsr origins of stability of the higher-order G-quadruplexes and explain in structural and energetic terms a strong preference for one particular end-to-end stacking orientation. Based on the recognized aggregation driving forces, we also suggest methods for controling the aggregation preferences openining up new opportunities for designing oligomeric G-quadruplexes.","G- quadruplexes (G4s) are secondary structures formed by guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences in living cells that participate in gene expression and chromosome maintenance.

One way to describe the complexity of our acoustic environment is in terms of information entropy: acoustic signals with high entropy convey large amounts of information, whereas low entropy signifies redundancy. To investigate how the brain processes this information, we controlled the amount of entropy in the signal by using pitch sequences. Participants listened to pitch sequences with varying amounts of entropy while we measured their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We show that the planum temporale (PT), a region of auditory association cortex, is sensitive to the entropy in pitch sequences. In two convergent fMRI studies, activity in PT increases as the entropy in the pitch sequence increases. The results establish PT as an important “computational hub” that requires less resource to encode redundant signals than it does to encode signals with high information content.","The present planum temporale (PT) is a brain region that encodes information in the form of pitch sequences.

While those problems can be solved with established methods of constraint-based modeling, no algorithm is currently available for genome-scale models to identify the pathway that has the highest possible thermodynamic driving force among all solutions with predefined stoichiometric properties. This gap is closed with our new approach OptMDFpathway which is based on the recently introduced concept of Max-min Driving Force (MDF). OptMDFpathway offers various applications, especially in the context of metabolic design of cell factories. To demonstrate the power and usefulness of OptMDFpathway, we employed it to analyze the endogenous CO2 fixation potential of Escherichia coli. While E. coli cannot assimilate CO2 into biomass, net CO2 fixation can take place along linear pathways from substrate to product and we show that thermodynamically feasible pathways with net CO2 assimilation exist for 145 (34) products when choosing glycerol (glucose) as substrate.

For gram-negative bacteria, adhesion is often mediated by pili, proteinaceous polymers that protrude from the bacterial surface and recognize host receptors. During assembly, each pilus protein subunit is assisted in folding by a chaperone that shuttles the subunit to an outer membrane usher complex, which serves as assembly platform. There, the chaperone transfers its subunit cargo into the growing pilus polymer, which protrudes out the usher pore. Here, we present the crystal structure of CfaA, the chaperone protein of the CFA/I pilus. The CFA/I pilus is the archetypal colonization factor (CF) for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, a major cause of life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea in young children of low-income countries and in travelers to these regions. This structure reveals unique features that allow us to define a new class of chaperones that assist pilus assembly in bacteria. Probing these unique features with site-direct mutagenesis, we were able to gain new insight into the mechanism of pilus assembly.","Pili assembled chaperone-escort pathway (CUP) chaperones are essential for the assembly of pilin subunits, which are essential for the initiation of bacterial infections.

Disruption of polarity is a diagnostic criterion of cancer, but exactly how deregulation of core polarity genes contribute to cancer and at which stage polarity loss promotes breast cancer development in vivo is still poorly understood. To address this directly, we deleted the core polarity gene Scrib specifically in the mouse mammary gland. Scrib loss resulted in loss of tissue architecture and duct hyperplasia in mature but not pubescent mice. Onset of hyperplasia was associated with defective spindle orientations, a failure to apoptose and was sustained by high cell turnover and Ras/Erk/Fra1 MAPK pathway activation. Scrib deficiency activated progenitors and resulted in the excess growth of atypical luminal cells and the development of ductal and alveolar hyperplasia. Overall these mice exhibited an increased incidence, onset and grade of mammary tumours. These studies provide a definitive demonstration of the critical role played by core polarity genes in maintaining mammary epithelial integrity in vivo.

We performed a trial where we treated macaques suffering from chronic diarrhea with human whipworms, collecting gut biopsies before and after treatment. We found that 4 out of the 5 treated macaques improved their symptoms and studied the changes in their gut immune responses, as they got better. We found that after treatment with worms, the monkeys had less bacteria attached to their intestinal wall and a reduced inflammatory response to the gut bacteria. Additionally, the composition of gut bacteria was altered in the sick macaques and was restored close to normal after treatment with whipworms.

Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases and Type II Diabetes are all examples of amyloid diseases. Determining the structure of amyloid fibrils is critical for understanding the mechanism of fibril formation as well as for the design of inhibitor molecules that can prevent aggregation. In the case of the Alzheimer Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, the structure of fibrils grown under conditions of mechanical agitation has been elucidated from a combination of simulation and experiments. However, the structures of the asymmetric quiescent Aβ fibrils (grown under conditions akin to physiological conditions) and of Alzheimer's brain–derived fibrils are not known. In this paper, we propose the first atomically detailed structures of these two fibrils, using molecular dynamics simulations combined with data from previously published experiments. In additions, we suggest a unifying lateral growth mechanism that explains the increased toxicity of quiescent Aβ fibrils, the effects of external perturbations on fibril lateral architecture and the inhibition mechanism of the small molecule inhibitors on fibril formation.","Amyloid- (A) fibrils are the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are composed primarily of Amyloid- (A) peptide fibrils. Morphologies of A fibrils are exquisitely sensitive to environmental conditions. Here, we propose atomically detailed structures of asymmetric polymorphs of A9- 40 peptide fibrils grown in quiescent conditions and second fibrils derived from AD patients 'brain- extracts'.

However, the molecular mechanisms that allow organisms to accurately sense nutrient availability and match their energetic demands accordingly are not well understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, we isolated mutants in C. elegans that survive about 50% longer than wild-type animals when starved. For one such mutant, we found that the extended survival was due to mutation in the unc-31 gene, which functions in the nervous system to mediate release of neuroendocrine signaling molecules including insulin. Although this gene is broadly expressed in the nervous system, we found that its activity is required in a small subset of sensory neurons to regulate starvation survival. These neurons have ciliated endings that function in detection of environmental cues. Disruption of these cilia, or inactivation of a TRPV channel localized to these cilia, mimicked the perception of nutrient deprivation leading to extended starvation survival, which is dependent on an insulin-regulated transcription factor. Disruption of this channel also extended adult lifespan. Taken together, our findings reveal that TRPV channels couple nutritional cues to neuroendocrine secretion, which in turn determines adult lifespan and larval starvation survival.","In the larval stage of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the absence of nutrients leads to a halt in development and starvation survival.

Cells possess DNA helicases that facilitate movement of the replication fork through such obstacles. Here, we report the discovery that one of these DNA helicases, Rrm3, is also required for restricting DNA synthesis under replication stress. We find that the site in Rrm3 critical for this new replication function is also required for binding a subunit of the replication origin recognition complex, which raises the possibility that Rrm3 controls replication by affecting initiation. This is supported by our finding that Rrm3 associates with a subset of replication origins. Rrm3’s ability to restrict replication does not require its helicase activity or the phosphorylation site that regulates this activity. Notably, cells need error-free bypass pathways and homologous recombination to deal with DNA lesions that arise when the helicase function of Rrm3 is disrupted, but not when its replication function is disrupted. This indicates that the DNA lesions that form in the absence of the two distinct Rrm3 function are different, although both activate the DNA-damage checkpoint and are toxic to cells that lack the mediator of the replication checkpoint Mrc1.","DNA synthesis is a critical step in the progression of many diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

Some epigenetic modifications accumulate throughout life in a highly reproducible manner–they may contribute to the aging process and facilitate reliable age-predictions. So far, little is known how these “epigenetic aging signatures” are modified in cancer tissue and whether or not they are accelerated as compared to normal tissue. In this study, we systematically analyzed age-associated DNAm patterns in many types of cancer. In contrast to non-malignant tissue the epigenetic aging signatures hardly reflect chronological age of cancer patients. This may at least partially be attributed to the fact that cancer is a clonal disease capturing only the epigenetic make-up of the tumor-initiating cell. Notably, the aberrant DNAm patterns are not randomly distributed but reveal co-regulation at regions that become methylated upon aging in non-malignant tissue. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deviations of epigenetic age-predictions correlate with clinical parameters. In fact, they are clearly associated with overall survival in many types of cancer. These findings are particularly important, as they indicate relevance of age-associated DNA methylation patterns for malignant transformation, cancer development and prognosis.","Cancer is the most common cause of death in the elderly, and aging is associated with higher prevalence of malignant diseases in the elderly.

In other infectious and non-infectious diseases in which the immune system is affected, such as HIV-AIDS and inflammatory bowel disease, damage to gut-associated lymphocyte tissues occurs, enabling luminal bacteria to enter into the circulation. Lipopolisaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial product that stimulates macrophages, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other soluble factors such as MIF, which in turn activate lymphocytes. Continuous and exaggerated stimulation causes exhaustion of the T-cell compartment, contributing to immunosuppression.Herein, we show that an increment in LPS plasma levels also occurs in VL; the higher the LPS levels, the lower the TCD4+ and TCD8+ cell count in the blood. This T-cell depletion may affect the mucosal immune system, which, along with intestinal parasitization by amastigotes, may contribute to gut barrier damage and consequent microbial translocation.

Little is known about the types of mutations that arise when facultative anaerobes are grown in the absence of oxygen. To investigate the effect of oxygen availability on spontaneous mutation at the genome level, we directly measured the mutation rates of bacteria that were grown with and without oxygen under controlled laboratory conditions. To our knowledge, we have obtained the most comprehensive mutation rate estimate of anaerobically grown Escherichia coli, where mutation rates are higher in the absence of oxygen. We found that genomic structural variations, a class of mutations that are typically not investigated due to technical difficulties, were more prevalent under anaerobic growth conditions. We also identified distinct DNA strand biases for substitution types under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions.

Diseases such as cancer may occur if the network regulations go wrong. In cancer research, network mining has been utilized to identify biomarkers, predict therapeutic targets, and discover new mechanisms for cancer development. Among these applications, the search for genes with similar expression patterns (co-expression) over different samples is particularly successful. However, few network mining approaches were systematically applied to different types of cancers to extract common cancer features. We carried out a systematic study to identify frequently co-expressed gene networks in multiple cancers and compared them with the gene networks found in multiple normal tissues. We found dramatic differences between networks from the two sources, with gene networks in cancer corresponding to specific traits of cancer. Specifically, the largest gene network in cancer contains many genes with cell cycle control and DNA stability functions. We thus predicted that a set of poorly studied genes in this network share similar functions and validated that most of these genes are involved in DNA break repair or proper cell division. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest scale of such a study.","Gene co-expression network analysis is an effective method for predicting gene functions of disease biomarkers.

Rational protein design has applications in developing biotherapeutics and in advancing synthetic biology and nanotechnology. Rational protein-interaction design has been approached in many ways over the past decades, but it remains a challenge. Computational methods require models to predict binding and tools for applying predictive models in design. Many such methods are based on modeling and evaluating protein structure using physical or semi-physical energy terms. In this work, we used a different strategy, deriving a binding model that describes the protein-protein interactions of basic-region leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcriptions factors directly from a large body of experimental interaction data. Our model showed much better performance than previously published predictors. We used our model, in conjunction with a protein-design strategy that builds new proteins from modular parts of known proteins, to successfully design novel bZIP-like protein domains. We demonstrated experimentally that the designed proteins bind tightly and specifically to a number of human bZIPs that regulate important processes including stress responses and oncogenesis.","The leucine- zipper (b) transcription factor is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of many cellular processes. The coiled-coil motif of the b transcription factor is one of the most conserved motifs in the family of transcription factors. The coiled-coil motif plays a key role in the homo- hetero-ization of the b transcription factor. In this work, we develop a predictive model for predicting the interactions between the coiled-coil motif and the b transcription factor. The model expresses the interaction sum energies interpretable by residue-pair triplet terms, achieves correlation experimental binding free energies R = 0.68 significantly, and performs scoring functions. Using this model, we devised a strategy for synthetic peptides built assembling 7 - residue native-protein heptad modules, which bind selectively to the human b coiled coil, target paralogs, and the human JUN, XBP1, ATF4, and ATF5 transcription factors. We tested 132 candidate protein complexes in fluorescence resonance transfer assay and confirmed formation of tight selective heterodimers designed peptides targets.",13.724710424710427

Here, we conducted a foraging experiment in which rats chose among four different foods over a continuous two-week time period. With respect to when, we found bursts of rapidly occurring responses separated by long inactive periods. With respect to what, we found biased choice behavior toward the favorite items as well as repetitive behavior, reflecting goal-directed and habitual responding, respectively. We account for the when and what components with two distinct computational mechanisms, each composed of two processes: (a) active and inactive states for the temporal dynamics, and (b) goal-directed and habitual control for the sequential dynamics. This study provides behavioral and computational insights into the dynamical properties of decision-making that determine both when an animal will act and what the animal will choose. Our findings provide an integrated framework for describing the temporal and sequential structure of everyday choices among, for example, food, music, books, brands, web-browsing and social interaction.","A fundamental understanding of behavior requires predicting individual choose.

Our aim was to investigate how these structurally homologous proteins can have such different thermostabilities, unfolding at temperatures that are 20°C apart. We used bioinformatics to reconstruct the sequences of ancestral proteins along each lineage, synthesized the proteins in the lab, and experimentally traced the evolution of ribonuclease H1 stability.

The initial innate immune responses to such viruses have to restrict virus spread before the adaptive immune responses fully develop. Therefore, it is of fundamental practical importance to understand the robustness and fragility of the early protection against such virus infections mediated by the type I interferon (IFN) response. Because of the inherent complexity of the virus-host system, we have used mathematical modeling to predict the sensitivity of the kinetics and severity of infection to variations in virus and host parameters. Our results suggest that the spleen represents a robust sink system for systemic virus infection and that this system is able to cope with substantial variations in IFN secretion and virus production. However, the system is very fragile to only minor increases in the virus growth rate in peripheral tissues.

Large changes to the local environment, e.g. moving the animal to a different room, can induce a complete reorganization of place-cell firing locations. Such ‘global remapping’ reveals that memory for different environments is encoded as separate spatial maps. Smaller changes to features within an environment can induce a modulation of place cell firing rates without affecting their firing locations. This kind of ‘rate remapping’ is still poorly understood. In this paper we describe a computational model in which discrete memories for contextual features were stored locally within a spatial map of place cells. This network structure supports retrieval of both positional and contextual information from an arbitrary cue, as required by an episodic memory structure. The activity of the network qualitatively matches empirical data from rate remapping experiments, both on the population level and the level of single place cells. The results support the idea that CA3 rate remapping reflects content-addressable memories stored as multimodal attractor states in the hippocampus.","Episodic-like memory is thought to support attractor dynamics in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that encodes spatial information.

Recently, proteomic analysis of wound exudates collected in the vicinity of affected tissue has become a powerful tool to study the pathogenesis of local envenoming from a more integrative perspective.

Our results showed an early presence of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in exudates as compared to cytoskeletal proteins, which reflect the rapid cytotoxic effect of venom, followed by the action of endogenous proteinases in the cytoskeleton of damaged muscle fibers later on in the course of envenoming. On the other hand, the early presence of extracellular matrix components and the increment of some of them in exudates, reflect the rapid microvascular damage and hemorrhage induced by the venom, followed by the action of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) during tissue remodeling as part of the inflammatory response.

Evolutionarily, recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations, thus explaining the pervasiveness of recombination and sex. Recombination is also a central parameter in population genetic studies designed to detect the presence of selection acting across genomes. Current evolutionary analyses are hindered, however, by the use of imprecise recombination rates that can influence the results and skew their interpretation. This limitation is associated with the lack of detailed characterization of natural variation in recombination across genomes and within species. Our study in Drosophila melanogaster represents the first integrated, whole-genome description of recombination that alleviates these deficiencies in any organism. Our results and conclusions will help to characterize the molecular basis of the observed variation in recombination across genomes and have an immediate impact on population genetic analyses of selection, laying the foundation for a new generation of population models that will better capture natural variation in recombination and its consequences.","Recombination is a fundamental biological process that increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations.

The human parasite P. falciparum transports proteins encoded by multigene families onto the surface of erythrocytes, mediating interactions between infected red blood cells (iRBCs) and other host-cells and are thought to play a key role in parasite survival during blood-stage development. The function of other exported Plasmodium protein families remains largely unknown. We provide novel insights into expression and cellular location of proteins encoded by three large multigene families of rodent malaria parasites (Fam-a, Fam-b and PIR). Multiple members of the same family are expressed in a single iRBC, unlike P. falciparum PfEMP1 proteins where individual iRBCs express only a single member. Most proteins we examined are located in the RBC cytoplasm and are not transported onto the iRBC surface membrane, indicating that these proteins are unlikely to mediate interactions between iRBCs and host-cells. Unexpectedly, liver stages also express many of these proteins, where they locate to the vacuole surrounding the parasite inside the hepatocyte. In support of a role of these proteins for parasite growth within their host cells we provide evidence that Fam-A proteins have a role in uptake and transport of (host) phosphatidylcholine for parasite-membrane synthesis.","Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is a multigene parasite that infects the red blood cells (RBC) of humans and animals.

Higher viral load set-points increase infectivity and decrease survival. Previous work has shown that the most commonly observed viral load set-points are those intermediate viral load set-points which lead to the largest number of opportunities to transmit HIV-1 in an infectious person's lifetime, balancing survival and infectiousness. This coincidence between the most common viral load set-points and the optimum for lifetime transmission could be the result of population-level selection acting on HIV-1. However, this could only have happened if viral load set-point is a heritable characteristic of the virus, i.e. if viral load set-points are similar between both partners of transmitting couples. By studying viral load set-points amongst heterosexual couples, we show that viral load set-points are similar in these couples. When we study only those couples with strong genetic support for transmission, their viral loads are even more similar than when we study the whole group. These results suggest that there are viral factors which are passed from one infected individual to the next which play a role in determining viral load set-point and that population-level selection could act upon these viral factors.","HIV-1 viral load set-point surrogate measure is a surrogate measure of HIV-1 viral virulence that is subject to natural selection in the human host population.

The complicated and multifactorial pathogenesis is not completely understood but involves disturbed epithelial barriers and immune reactions against the commensal flora in genetically predisposed individuals. Some inherited disease mechanisms are specific for small intestinal CD and are often connected to impaired Paneth cells. These specialized cells are critical for epithelial defences in the small intestine, and their most abundant antimicrobials (HD-5 and HD-6) are primarily diminished in patients who suffer from CD at this location. In this context, we previously identified a primary role of the Wnt pathway factor TCF7L2, which regulates the expression of both these antimicrobial peptides. We have now studied a functional mutation in the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 that was more frequent in early onset ileal CD. It was also associated with severe penetrating behaviour and linked to especially low HD-5 expression in ileal CD patient biopsies. Independently, we found that a reduced epithelial expression likely represents an additional impairment of the Wnt co-receptor in the disorder. LRP6 is a new player in small intestinal CD and underlines the importance of Paneth cell antimicrobial defences in the disease pathogenesis.","Ileal Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic small intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by reduced levels of antimicrobial peptides DEFA5 (HD-5) and DEFA6 (HD-6).

Many documented cases suggest that symptom recovery is accompanied with antiviral RNA silencing. Most plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that can facilitate transient viral entry into meristems by blocking host RNA silencing defenses. However, the mechanisms of the following longer-term viral exclusion and modulation of VSRs functions remain elusive. Our studies with a substitution mutation in the CP gene demonstrate that the CMV CP has a negative role in SAM invasion. The studies suggest that during late infections, increasing CP concentrations induce potent RDR6/SGS3-dependent antiviral silencing by down-regulating accumulation of the 2b protein and induction of efficient siRNA amplification. Here, we propose a new evolutionary strategy in which the CMV CP has a role mediating viral self-attenuation and long-term symptom recovery.","Shoot apical meristems (SAMs) are resistant to plant viruses, but are restrained by viral suppressors RNA silencing (VSRs) to facilitate the transient viral invasion of SAM.

It is well known that the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) plays a vital role in the binding of competitive inhibitors in tyrosine kinases, and numerous mutations have been found occurred around the P-loop, which may affect the binding/unbinding process of a drug. Free energy surfaces were constructed to characterize the impact of the mutation to the binding/unbinding process of a well-known NSCLC drug, crizotinib. Two advanced free energy calculation methods, namely funnel based well-tempered metadynamics and umbrella sampling based absolute binding free energy calculation achieved consistent results with the experimental data, suggesting that the rigid P-loop of the mutated target was mainly responsible for the crizotinib resistance to ROS1 tyrosine kinase.","Tyrosine kinases are widely regarded as excellent targets for chemical drug therapy in cancer cells.

Recently, it was discovered that bacteria also form organelles–bacterial microcompartments (BMCs)–composed of a protein shell that surrounds functionally related enzymes. BMCs long evaded detection because they typically form only in the presence of the substrate they metabolize, and they can only be visualized by electron microscopy. A few BMCs have been experimentally characterized; they have diverse functions in CO2 fixation, pathogenesis, and niche colonization. While the encapsulated enzymes differ among functionally distinct BMCs, the shell architecture is conserved. This enables their detection computationally, as genes for shell proteins are typically nearby genes for the encapsulated enzymes. We developed a novel algorithm to comprehensively identify and categorize BMCs in sequenced bacterial genomes. We show that BMCs are often encoded adjacent to genes that play supporting roles to the organelle's function.

Different PTM sites within a protein usually co-operate to fulfill their functional roles. Recent advances in high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) technologies have facilitated the proteome-wide identification of PTM sites, giving rise to both challenge and opportunity to understand their functional relationships. Previously, several data mining approaches have been developed to explore the global PTM interplays. In this study, we proposed to infer functional associations between PTM sites from the correlation of their modification status across many biological conditions, which was not exploited before. In practice, we tested if a pair of sites are modified together under the same condition significantly more often than expected (co-occurrence). As a proof of principle, we applied this analytical strategy to human phosphorylation because we could collect data sets of proteome-wide coverage under 88 different conditions. We demonstrated that sites with co-occurring phosphorylation status are functionally associated from several lines of evidence. The co-occurrence analysis can also uncover functionally connected phosphosites with clear biological evidence which are missed by other approaches. With increasing proteome-wide data for other types of PTMs under different conditions, the co-occurrence analysis can be integrated with other methods to identify novel PTM associations.","Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are a complex set of modifications that add layer complexity to the proteome and regulate a wide range of cellular protein functions.

A series of experimental and computational studies of gene expression in various murine tissues has led us to a different conclusion. By applying a new analysis strategy and a number of alternative algorithms, we identify baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all genes. While the phase and amplitude of oscillation vary between different tissues, circadian oscillation remains a fundamental property of every gene. Reanalysis of previously published data also reveals a greater number of oscillating genes than was previously reported. This suggests that circadian oscillation is a universal property of all mammalian genes, although phase and amplitude of oscillation are tissue-specific and remain associated with a gene's function. We hypothesize that the cell's metabolic respiratory cycle drives the oscillatory pattern of gene expression. These findings imply that biological pathways should be considered as dynamic systems of genes oscillating in coordination with each other.","Circadian periodicity is a biological phenomenon that describes gene expression in multiple peripheral tissues. It is accepted that 10% of genes oscillate daily in mammals, regulated by the molecular clock.

In Escherichia coli, DnaA binds ATP and ADP with similar affinity but only the ATP bound form is active. An increased level of DnaAATP causes overinitiation and cell death by accumulation of DNA strand breaks. These strand breaks often result from forks encountering gapped DNA formed during repair of oxidative damage. We provide evidence that cell death in overinitiating cells can be prevented by rewiring the metabolism to favor the micro-aerobic respiratory chain with the cytochrome bd-1 as terminal oxidase. Cytochrome bd-1 is found in aerobic as well as anaerobic bacteria. Its role is to reduce O2 in micro-aerobic conditions and work as an electron sink to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species. Our results suggest that bacteria can cope with replication stress by increasing respiration through cytochrome bd-1 to reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species, and hence oxidative damage to a level that does not interfere with replication fork progression.","Chromosome replication in Escherichia coli is initiated by the DnaA- oriC nucleoprotein complex. DnaA binds ATP essential for the formation of the DnaA- oriC nucleoprotein complex and promotes strand opening, helicase loading and replisome assembly.

Until recently the constraints of working at biosafety level 4 had hindered the large scale study of host factors associated with henipavirus infection. MicroRNAs are a class of single-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate biological processes in eukaryotes. An emerging body of evidence suggests that host microRNAs may favour infection of vertebrate RNA viruses. We have performed high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection and appear to suppress multiple antiviral host molecules. Infection promotion is primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to repress Eph receptors that negatively regulate henipavirus glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion. This study is the first large-scale screen of host-encoded microRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus, and of a BSL-4 virus, and supports the emerging notion that host miRNAs can play a role in supporting infection of RNA viruses.","Henipaviruses are a family of paramyxoviridae that cause fatal disease in humans and mammals.

This study investigated the seroprevalence of RVFV in 1861 residents of western Kenya and compared this to the seroprevalence in 553 ruminant slaughterhouse workers. The seroprevalence of RVFV in people in western Kenya was less than 1%, which is consistent with previous reports from the region. Slaughterhouse workers were shown to be a higher risk group for RVFV seropositivity, with seroprevalence of 2.5%. The identification of plausible risk factors including slaughtering is consistent with reports from other regions.

In most countries, vector control is implemented by the use of insecticides to reduce mosquito populations. During epidemics, insecticides of the pyrethroid family (blocking the voltage gated sodium channel protein in the nerve sheath) are used by space spraying with vehicle mounted thermal foggers to kill adult mosquitoes. Unfortunately some populations of Ae. aegypti have become resistant to these insecticides, leading to operational challenges for public health services. In Martinique (French West Indies), resistance to pyrethroids was detected in the 1990s. The present study assessed the impact of this resistance on the efficacy of vector control operations in 9 localities of Martinique.

In humans, monocytes are recruited to the site of infection and differentiate into MΦ upon the onset of microbial infection. The MΦ phenotype and function are determined by the cytokine profile of the microenvironment in which the monocyte enters. Additionally, vitamin D is known to trigger direct antimicrobial responses against invading pathogens in MΦ, but also disrupts the differentiation of immune subsets within the myeloid lineage. Therefore, we investigated whether vitamin D status during MΦ differentiation influenced either phenotype or function. Here, we found that the IL-15 MΦphenotype is sustained regardless of vitamin D status. In contrast, antimicrobial MΦ differentiated in the presence of vitamin D exhibited a robust expression of an antimicrobial peptide, relative to MΦ differentiated in the absence of vitamin D. The antimicrobial MΦ armed with cathelicidin prior to M. leprae challenge demonstrated a strong antimicrobial response against the invading pathogen.

In both parasite forms, transmission is dependent on exocytosis of stage-specific vesicles. In gametocytes these vesicles release proteins allowing egress from red blood cells and fertilization, and are hence needed to establish an infection in the mosquito. In contrast, proteins are secreted into the membrane of the sporozoite, where they play distinct roles during adhesion and motility, both crucial for transmission back into the mammalian host. Here we show that parasites lacking the putative small solute transporter PAT are still able to form vesicles in both parasite forms but are unable to fuse and secrete their contents. This results in impaired parasite transmission into and from the mosquito. Our work shows that a single protein can regulate the function of functionally distinct classes of vesicles in different life cycle forms of a parasite.","Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of malaria, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa.

These fungi can grow in soil from forests, deforested areas, sugarcane, coffee, and rice plantations, as well as pasturelands, and they are strongly associated to armadillo burrows, which can explain their frequent isolation from this mammal’s tissues. The environmental detection of these pathogens in endemic and non-endemic areas of PCM is important for mapping risk areas, as well as for understanding the infection ability and clinical manifestations of these fungi. These pieces of information are not provided by isolates obtained from human patients, because these fungi have a long latency period and the human host can migrate, leading to a misinterpretation of the actual geographic distribution of these pathogens. By using two different molecular methodologies (Nested PCR and in situ fluorescence), we detected both species of P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii in soil and in aerosol samples, even in areas where PCM is only associated to one of these two species. These data might indicate different habitat maintenance strategies between the species, which means that the infection ability may change according to the climatic and soil conditions.

A few years ago the following question was posed: Imagine that aliens would provide us with a brain-sized clump of matter, with complete freedom to sculpt realistic neuronal networks with arbitrary precision. Would we be able to build a brain? The answer appears to be no, because this technology is actually materializing, not in the form of an alien kick-start, but through steady progress in computing power, simulation methods and the emergence of databases on connectivity, neural cell types, complete with gene expression, etc. A number of groups have created brain-scale simulations, others like the Blue Brain project may not have simulated a full brain, but they included almost every single detail known about the neurons they modelled. And yet, we do not know how we reach for a glass of milk.Mechanistic, large-scale models require simulations that bridge multiple scales. Here we present a method that allows the study of two dimensional dynamical systems subject to noise, with very little restrictions on the dynamical system or the nature of the noise process.

As the mechanism of such regulation, widely accepted has been the notion of the intraembryonic distribution of regulatory molecules called “morphogens”. One of the best-studied morphogens is Bicoid in the early developmental stage of the Drosophila embryo. Synthesized around the anterior pole of the embryo, Bicoid forms an exponential gradient of concentration to initiate expression of a target gene, hunchback, in nuclei at the periphery of the embryo. This invariably forms a concentration boundary of the product protein Hunchback at around 49% embryo length. Remarkably, the embryo-embryo variability in the boundary position is less than 5%. Reactions in embryos, however, should be intrinsically noisy because the number of molecules involved is small, and those reactions are governed by randomly diffusing molecules. The mechanisms to generate the invariable Hunchback distribution by filtering the intense noise remain mysterious, and here we construct models to shed light on this problem. Stochastic simulations show that the slow diffusion of Hunchback averages out the intense noise, so that the coordinated rates of diffusion and transport of input Bicoid and output Hunchback play decisive roles in suppressing fluctuations.","The precise patterning of morphogen molecules is important for the development of embryos. Recent experiments have shown that the gradient concentration of Bicoid morphogen in Drosophila embryos is stable in syncytial mitoses. However, the precise distribution of Bicoid morphogen molecules in the early embryo remains a mystery. Here, we address this issue by developing one-dimensional models of the early embryo. We show that the fluctuation in the expression of hunchback gene dominates the random arrival of Bicoid hunchback enhancer in the early embryo. Slow diffusion of Hunchback protein leads to the precise patterning distribution of Hunchback loss boundary distribution in the early embryo. The coordinated rates of diffusion transport of input Bicoid output Hunchback play decisive roles in suppressing fluctuations arising from dynamical structure change in embryos arising from random diffusion molecules.",13.104012158054712

The main route of transmission of HTBMb is the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, causing mostly extrapulmonary disease. M. bovis is naturally resistant to pyrazinamide, a drug that allows for a shorter treatment course. Therefore, if M. bovis is not properly identified or if there is resistance to other drugs, proper treatment may be hindered. Most laboratories in developing countries do not routinely perform mycobacterial cultures, and only a few laboratories can identify M. bovis. Therefore, HTBMb cases are believed to be underestimated.

We report a large proportion of M. bovis isolates from pulmonary samples, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human airborne transmission.

This catalogue confirms that non–SNP variants account for more than half of genomic variation, allowing us to provide new insights into the non-random distribution of variants in the Drosophila genome. We further present genome-wide cis-associations with gene expression based on whole adult fly microarray data, revealing significant associations for about 2,000 genes.

Surface receptors are mobile on the cell surface and their mobility is influenced by their interaction with intracellular proteins. We wish to understand the details of these interactions and how they are affected by cellular activation. An experimental technique called single particle tracking (SPT) uses optical microscopy to study the motion of cell-surface receptors, revealing important details about the organization of the cell membrane.

Using our analysis we are able to reliably differentiate receptor motion when a receptor is freely diffusing on the membrane versus when it is interacting with an intracellular protein. By observing the frequency of transitions between free and bound states, we are able to estimate reaction rates for the interaction.

While some mutations affect an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce, most are neutral and have no effect. Neutral mutations play an important role in the study of evolution because they generally accrue at a consistent rate over time. This result, first discovered 50 years ago, allows neutral mutations to be used as a “molecular clock” to estimate, for example, how long ago humans diverged from chimpanzees and bonobos. We used mathematical modeling to study how the rates of these molecular clocks are affected by the spatial arrangement of a population in its habitat. We find that asymmetry in this spatial structure can either slow down or speed up the rate at which neutral mutations accrue. This effect could potentially skew our estimates of past events from genetic data. It also has implications for a number of other fields. For example, we show that the architecture of intestinal tissue can limit the rate of genetic substitutions leading to cancer. We also show that the structure of social networks affects the rate at which new ideas replace old ones.

Therefore, the replication strategies of viruses may provide not only the understanding of virus pathogenesis but also useful models to disentangle the complex machinery of host cells. Translation regulation of viral mRNA is a good example of this. Borna disease virus (BDV) is a highly neurotropic RNA virus which is characterized by persistent infection. BDV expresses mRNAs as polycistronic coding transcripts. Among them, the 0.8 kb X/P mRNA encodes at least three open reading frames (ORFs), upstream ORF, X, and P. Although BDV X and P have opposing effects in terms of viral polymerase activity, the translational regulation of X/P polycistronic mRNA has not been elucidated. In this study, we show an ingenious strategy of translational control of viral regulatory protein using host factors. We demonstrate that host RNA helicases, mainly DDX21, can affect ribosomal reinitiation of X via interaction with the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of X/P mRNA and that the downstream P protein autogenously controls the translation of X by interfering with the binding of DDX21 to the 5′ UTR.

Recently, it was shown that the protein H-NS selectively silences genes gained by horizontal transfer in enteric bacteria. Regulated expression of these genes can then evolve and be integrated into the regulatory network of the new host. Our analysis of the catabolic bgl (aryl-β,D-glucoside) operon, which is silenced by H-NS in E. coli, provides a snapshot on the evolution of such a locus. Genes of the bgl operon were presumably gained by horizontal transfer from Gram-positive bacteria to ancestral enteric bacteria. In E. coli, the bgl operon co-evolved with the diversification of the species into four phylogenetic groups. In one phylogenetic group the bgl operon is functional. However, in two other phylogenetic groups, bgl accumulates disrupting mutations, and it is absent in the fourth group. This indicates that the H-NS–silenced bgl operon evolved differently in E. coli and is presumably positively selected in one phylogenetic group, while it is neutrally or negatively selected in the other groups.","Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of the most pathogenic bacteria in the world.

If untreated, symptomatic VL leads to systemic pathologies and is usually fatal. Up to approximately 400,000 new cases are estimated to occur annually, and regional epidemics have been devastatingly severe. Diagnosis of clinically suspect cases in the field, and thus appropriate treatment, relies principally on a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) based on detection of antibodies against a Leishmania antigen known as rK39. Although this test is reliable in South Asia, it has shown less success in East Africa. One reason may reside in diversity of the rK39 homologue among East African L. donovani, with consequent limitations in the binding of diagnostic antibodies. Here, we investigate the sequences of rK39 homologues in a panel of East African L. donovani strains, and show that there is significant diversity compared to rK39 and to South Asian sequences. Additionally, we examine diversity in another diagnostic antigen known as HASPB1/2. Our results indicate that an improved RDT may need to encompass East-African-specific antigen diversity to provide high performance field diagnosis for this region.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major public health problem in endemic regions of South Asia, East Africa, and Brazil.

Here, we develop a mathematical framework to study the underlying causes of a bursting phenomenon in network activity known as avalanching. As prototypical examples, we study a model of disease spreading in a population of individuals and a model of brain activity in a neural network. Although avalanching is well-documented in neural networks, thought to be crucial for learning, information processing, and memory, it has not been studied before in disease spreading. We employ tools originally used to analyze thermodynamic systems to argue that randomness in the actions of individual network components plays a fundamental role in avalanche formation. We show that avalanching is a spontaneous behavior, brought about by a phenomenon reminiscent to a phase transition in statistical mechanics, caused by increasing randomness as the network size decreases. Our work demonstrates that a previously suggested balanced feed-forward network structure is not necessary for neuronal avalanching. Instead, we attribute avalanching to a reallocation of the global minima of the network's stationary potential energy landscape, caused by a noise-induced deformation of its topographic surface.","Avalanching is a complex phenomenon characterized by the bursting of activity scales and free properties in a network.

This corresponds to the boundaries of the ancient continent of Sahul, which broke up due to rising sea levels about 9000 years before present. The distribution of languages in this region conveys information about its population history. The recent migration of the Austronesian speakers can be traced with precision, but the histories of the Papuan and Australian language speakers are considerably more difficult to reconstruct. The speakers of these languages are presumably descendants of the first migrations into Sahul, and their languages have been subject to many millennia of dispersal and contact. Due to the antiquity of these language families, there is insufficient lexical evidence to reconstruct their histories. Instead we use abstract structural features to infer population history, modeling language change as a result of both inheritance and horizontal diffusion. We use a Bayesian phylogenetic clustering method, originally developed for investigating genetic recombination to infer the contribution of different linguistic lineages to the current diversity of languages. The results show the underlying structure of the diversity of these languages, reflecting ancient dispersals, millennia of contact, and probable phylogenetic groups. The analysis identifies 10 ancestral language populations, some of which can be identified with previously known phylogenetic groups (language families or subgroups), and some of which have not previously been proposed.","The ancient Sahul continent (present day Australia New Guinea and surrounding islands) is home to extreme linguistic diversity. apart from the huge Austronesian language family, the region has hundreds of languages apparently unrelated to each other.

These elements contribute to genome instability, control of host gene expression and adaptation to changing environments.

The retrovirus-like retrotransposon, Ty1, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an invaluable model for retrotransposon research, and hundreds of host factors that regulate Ty1 retrotransposition have been identified. Non-essential subunits of the Mediator transcriptional co-activator complex have been identified as one set of host factors implicated in Ty1 regulation. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the effects of loss of these non-essential subunits of Mediator on Ty1 retrotransposition. Our findings reveal a heretofore unknown mechanism by which Mediator influences the balance between transcription from two promoters in Ty1 to modulate expression of an autoinhibitory transcript known as Ty1i RNA.

Protein folding, the complex, concerted motion of a protein chain towards a unique three-dimensional structure, is one example of where such reduction of complexity is useful. It is usually assumed that the projected dynamics is diffusive. However, many experiments and simulations have shown that the projected dynamics is sub-diffusive, i.e., the mean square displacement grows slower than linear with time. It means that the dynamics has a memory; that the free energy surface together with diffusion coefficient do not properly define the dynamics; and that such projections cannot be used to accurately describe dynamics. Here, we show that if one carefully constructs the reaction coordinate by optimizing (maximizing) its free energy profile, one can use a simple (memory-less) diffusive description. Loosely speaking, when the complex dynamics is projected onto a simple coordinate, all the complexity of the original dynamics goes into the memory of the projected dynamics. If the dynamics is projected onto the (complex) optimum reaction coordinate, all the complexity of the original dynamics is in the reaction coordinate, and the projected dynamics is simple.","The diffusion of free energy on the surface of a protein is considered to be a function of its reaction coordinate.

However, categorization is complicated because an object can belong to multiple categories. Thus, to inform our categorical judgments, we must make use of prior information. Given the importance of categorization, we hypothesized that humans utilize optimal strategies for making categorical judgments that allow us to minimize categorization errors. We found, though, that whereas subjects used prior information (i.e., category prior probability), they were sub-optimal in their categorization behavior. This seems to be common in other perceptual and cognitive tasks as well. We then explored the bases for this sub-optimal behavior and found that it can be consistent with an optimal strategy if we assume that subjects have trial-by-trial noise in components of the judgment process. This work extends previous similar findings into the field of auditory categorization and provides a means to reinterpret previous results.","Categorization is an important cognitive process that corrects stimulus challenging categories overlapping boundaries.

Complex excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions within the antennal lobe and the olfactory bulb alter the responses of the principal neurons throughout the duration of the odor stimulation. These dynamic changes progressively increase the difference between firing patterns evoked by structurally similar odors, potentially helping the animal distinguish one odor from another. However, this process, called odor decorrelation, appears to oppose another important goal of olfactory processing, to minimize the inevitable noisy variations in representations of the same odor encountered under different environmental conditions; such variations could potentially lead to misclassification. It remains an interesting mystery how olfactory circuitry can solve these two seemingly contradictory goals as they process olfactory stimuli: first, separating different but chemically similar odors (sensitivity, capacity); and second, identifying representations of the same odor in a noisy environment (reliability). Our results suggest a balance between inhibitory and excitatory connections mediated by local antennal lobe interneurons enhances the decorrelation of similar odors while keeping the representation robust in the presence of noise.",Neurons in the insect antennal lobe represent ability to spatiotemporal patterns of activity unfold multiple time scales.

The purpose was to observe the movement of the Biospeckle dots and to detect differences depending on the presence of the parasite, the quantity of the parasite and the conditions of the parasites when they are affected by a drug. We designed a method using VDRL plates where the sample has a relatively small volume and is flat shaped, a laser, a camera and a lens.

These data for the first time show the phenotypic range and continuity of a nearly complete set of possible binding targets in vivo, and they are useful in our ability to understand the mechanism, evolution, and designability of gene regulation.","Gene expression is regulated by a variety of transcription factors, including transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors, transcription factors,",206.93313725490196

We present a probabilistic model of pol-II transcription dynamics that can be used to compute RNA transcription speed and infer the temporal pol-II activity at the gene promoter. The inferred promoter activity profile is used to determine genes that are responding in a coordinated manner to stimuli and are therefore potentially co-regulated.

We show directly in vitro and in vivo that this nucleosome structure is critical for histone H2A and H2AX ubiquitinations and the DNA damage response in cells. In addition, we engineered a novel biological tool that blocked the nucleosome acidic patch of all histone H2A species leading to the repression of the DNA damage response in cells.

Current understanding of the genetic basis for these gaits is limited to one known mutation apparently necessary, but not sufficient, for explaining variability in “gaitedness.” The Standardbred breed includes two distinct groups, trotters, which exhibit a two-beat gait in which the opposite forelimb and hind limb move together, and pacers, which exhibit an alternative two-beat gait where the legs on the same side of the body move together. Our long-term objective is to identify variants underlying the ability of certain Standardbreds to pace. In this study, we were able to identify several regions of the genome highly associated with pacing and, within these regions, a number of specific highly associated variants. Although the biological function of these variants has yet to be determined, we developed a model based on seven variants that was > 99% accurate in predicting whether an individual was a pacer or a trotter in two independent populations.

We also used a conditional inference tree algorithm to predict the status of American Standardbred trotters and Standardbred horses as potential race pacers trotters.

Evolutionarily, GAAPs are extremely well conserved with closely related proteins in plants, insects, amphibia, and mammals, the viral and human counterparts sharing a striking 73% sequence identity. GAAPs are resident in the Golgi and inhibit apoptosis induced by a wide range of apoptotic stimuli. Knockout of h-GAAP, which is expressed in every tissue tested, induced cell death by apoptosis. The close relationship between the viral and the human proteins was confirmed in that v-GAAP could complement for the loss of h-GAAP and promote cell survival. Deletion of the v-GAAP gene from vaccinia virus affected virus virulence.

This transformation is manifested by a greatly thickened and rigid (sclerotized) exoskeletal cuticle secreted by the forewing epidermis. We demonstrate that this evolutionary modification is accompanied by the incorporation of two highly abundant structural proteins into the elytral cuticle, namely TcCPR18 and TcCPR27. Depletion of these proteins by RNA interference results in malformation and weakening of the elytra, culminating in insect death. These proteins are also abundant in hard cuticle from other regions such as the pronotum and ventral abdomen, but are absent in soft cuticles, and therefore may function as key determinants of rigid cuticle. Expression of such proteins at high levels in the modified forewing appears to have been a fundamental evolutionary step in the transformation of the membranous wing into a thickened and rigid elytron in the Coleoptera.","The red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) is one of the world's most important insect pollinators.

We found that in heterozygous male mosquitoes, this genetic modification induced complete early dominant embryo lethality in crosses with wild-type females. All spermatozoa from these males, including those not containing the genetic modification, carried the chromosome X cutting enzyme that could attack the maternally inherited X chromosome of the embryo. Furthermore, this genetic modification introduced a strong, negative bias toward X chromosome–carrying spermatozoa.

TR DNA binding also allows tethering of the viral genome to mitotic chromosomes to mediate DNA segregation to daughter nuclei. We describe here the crystal structure of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 LANA DNA binding domain, which is homologous to that of KSHV LANA.

It is known that recognition is performed in three stages. In the first stage, the sensors respond to an odor by displaying a reproducible neuronal pattern. This code is turned, in the second and third stages, into a sparse code, that is, only relatively few neurons activate over hundreds of milliseconds. It is generally assumed that the insect brain uses this temporal code to recognize an odor. We propose a new model of how this temporal code emerges using sequential activation of groups of neurons. We show that these sequential activations underlie a fast and accurate recognition which is highly robust against neuronal or sensory noise. This model replicates several key experimental findings and explains how the insect brain achieves both speed and robustness of odor recognition as observed in experiments.","The olfactory system of the insect brain encodes spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the antennal lobe of the brain. In the mushroom body, this information is encoded in dense overlapping patterns of activity in the antennal lobe of the mushroom brain. The dense overlapping patterns transform olfactory sparse code Kenyon cells into olfactory sparse code. In this paper, we present a new computational model that can qualitatively reproduce experimentally observed activity in the antennal lobe of the mushroom body. We show that the model is able to qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed activity in the antennal lobe of the mushroom body. Specifically, we show that the model can qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed activity in the antennal lobe of the mushroom body.",13.822709923664124

Current standard of care therapy requires patients to travel to a clinic for twenty consecutive days for injections of meglumine antimoniate (MA). This may represent an economic burden, particularly for patients living far from healthcare services, especially children and their caregivers. We performed mathematical modeling to compare costs of the standard of care treatment with costs of miltefosine, an equivalently efficacious oral medication that allows pediatric patients to be treated at home under trained supervision of a caregiver. In our model, miltefosine led to substantially lower costs for patients and only slightly higher costs to the healthcare system. Importantly, the cost to society (combined patient and healthcare system costs) was lower for miltefosine compared to MA. Treatment of pediatric CL with miltefosine in the patient’s home could decrease overall cost of treatment, while diminishing the barriers and cost burden on patients, their caregivers, and society.","Oral meglumine antimoniate (MA) treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in children has been shown to be effective and cost-effective.

Infections tend be chronic and may last for many years. Chronic STH infections are associated with modulation of the immune response, a consequence of which may be a reduced prevalence of allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma. The mechanisms by which STH infections suppress inflammatory responses are poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesized that STH infections may affect immune responses through alterations of immune homeostasis (or the steady-state adjustments of the immune system that maintain equilibrium). We investigated the capacity of blood from children classified as having no, light, or chronic STH infections to produce cytokines at rest (i.e. no immunologic stimulation) and the expression of genes in blood samples. Our data show that blood cells of children with chronic STH infections have an altered immune response that is likely to be associated with less allergic inflammation (the modified Th2 response) and that the expression of some inflammatory genes are reduced. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which STH infections suppress immune responses in children to ensure the survival of the parasite and reduce inflammation.","Chronic soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are associated with effects on systemic immune responses that are caused by alterations in the immune response.

Both are based on a densely packed coat of a single protein, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which covers the entire extracellular surface of the cell. The first strategy is antigenic variation, through which individual cells switch the identity of the expressed VSG at a low frequency and are selected by the host immune response. If the VSG is novel, the trypanosome proliferates, maintaining the infection; if it doesn't switch, or if the new VSG is not novel, it will be killed. In the second strategy, the VSG acts as a protective barrier, shielding the cell from innate and adaptive immune factors until there is an overwhelming titre of antibodies recognising the expressed VSG. In this review, the VSG coat is modelled, and past experiments that investigated how it protected the trypanosome are revisited using current knowledge of VSG sequence and structure. The conclusions are: (i) the identity of the individual VSGs explains early experimental variation; (ii) most of the VSG molecule is accessible to antibodies. This second conclusion highlights a gap in our understanding of how the VSG coat works, as several plasma membrane proteins with large extracellular domains are very unlikely to be hidden from host antibodies by VSG.","The variant plasma surface (VSG) coat covers the external face of the mammalian bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei and acts as a physical barrier.

The widely studied model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has none of the known light transduction systems, but we discovered that C. elegans has a robust locomotory response to ultraviolet light. C. elegans may use this light response to escape damaging or lethal doses of sunlight. Ultraviolet and other shortwave light, such as violet and blue wavelengths, drive locomotion by bypassing two critical signals, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and diacylglycerol (DAG), that neurons use to shape and control behaviors. C. elegans mutants lacking these signals are paralyzed and unresponsive to harsh physical stimuli in ambient light, but short-wavelength light rapidly rescues their paralysis and restores greater-than-normal levels of coordinated locomotion. This astonishing light response is mediated by a novel ultraviolet light receptor that acts in neurons. Our results reveal a novel molecular solution for ultraviolet light detection and an unusual sensory modality in C. elegans that is unlike any previously described light response in any organism.","The ability of organisms to transduce light signals is crucial for survival.

Our brain can reconstruct the third dimension from these flat retinal images using multiple sources of visual information, or cues. The horizontal displacement of the two retinal images, known as binocular disparity, and the relative motion between different objects are two important depth cues. However, to make the most of the information provided by each cue, our brains must efficiently integrate across them. To examine this process, we used neuroimaging in monkeys to record brain responses evoked by stimuli signaling depths defined by either binocular disparity or relative motion in isolation, and also when the two cues are combined congruently or incongruently. We found that cortical area MT in monkeys is involved in the fusion of these two particular depth cues, in contrast to previous human imaging data that pinpoint a more posterior cortical area, V3B/KO. Our findings support the existence of depth cue integration mechanisms in primates; however, this fusion appears to be computed in slightly different areas in humans and monkeys.","Neuroscientists have long puzzled over the role of the middle temporal (MT) area of the brain in the integration of visual and spatial cues.

Although many regulators that mediate changes in protein phosphorylation are known, how these regulators inter-connect in a single regulatory network that can transmit cellular signals is not known. It is also unclear how regulators that promote growth and regulators that activate the stress response interconnect to reorganize resource allocation during stress. Here, we developed an integrated experimental and computational workflow to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes during osmotic stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The workflow integrates data measuring protein phosphorylation changes in response to osmotic stress with known physical interactions between yeast proteins from large-scale datasets, along with other information about how regulators recognize their targets. The resulting network suggested new signaling connections between regulators and pathways, including those involved in regulating growth and defense, and predicted new regulators involved in stress defense.

We showed that the lack of miR-202 results in the sterility of both females and males. In particular, it led to a drastic reduction of both the number and the quality of eggs produced by females. Mutant females exhibited either no egg production or produced a drastically reduced number of eggs that could not be fertilized, ultimately leading to no reproductive success.

We typically think of bacterial evolution in terms of what is gained: a bacterium might, for example, acquire an antibiotic resistance gene, or modify an existing enzyme to make better use of a nutrient source. By analyzing the fitness of bacterial populations under more than 100 different conditions, we show that in fact what they lose can be equally important: by rewiring the cell's metabolism, loss of function mutations can provide substantial fitness benefits under many challenging conditions, even cases such as exotic nutrient combinations where some new enzymatic function might seem to be required. Loss of function mutations occur at a much higher frequency than gains of specific functionality due to the larger mutational target area available. The combination of the rapid acquisition and broad functionality of loss-of-function mutations suggests that they play a major role in the early adaptation of bacterial populations to new challenges.","The ability of bacteria to adapt to new environments depends on their ability to acquire new cellular functions.

These studies therefore emphasized the importance of topbp1 function as well as DNA damage response pathways during the fetal HSPC rapid proliferation.","Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HCPs), which are the precursors of hematopoietic",182.05275862068967

The relative ease of aerosol preparation and high virulence makes Y. pestis a dangerous bioweapon. The current study describes the treatment of established pneumonic plague with the widely available, broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofloxacin in a nonhuman primate model. African green monkeys inhaled a target dose of 100 lethal doses for 50% of animals (LD50) and were monitored for fever and vital signs by telemetry. Fever was the first sign of illness, correlating with bacteremia but preceding radiographic pneumonia, and initiated intravenous levofloxacin treatment in doses designed to mimic antibiotic levels achieved in humans. All animals treated with saline died and all animals completing 10 days of treatment survived, with resolution of high fever within 24–48 hours.

By entering the intracellular milieu, these pathogens are protected from harsh environmental factors in the host, including the humoral and cellular immune responses. Porphyromonas gingivalis is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the oral mucosa and accesses the bloodstream and distant sites such as the blood vessel walls, brain, placenta and other organs. Still unclear is how P. gingivalis traverses from oral mucosa to these distant sites. Dendritic cells are highly migratory antigen presenting cells that “patrol” the blood, skin, mucosa and all the major organ systems. Capture of microbes by dendritic cells activates a tightly regulated series of events, including directed migration towards the secondary lymphoid organs, where processed antigens are ostensibly presented to T cells. Autophagy is now recognized as an integral component of microbial clearance, antigen processing and presentation by dendritic cells. We report here that P. gingivalis is able to subvert autophagic destruction within dendritic cells. This occurs through its glycoprotein fimbriae, called Mfa-1, which targets the C-type lectin DC-SIGN on dendritic cells. The other major fimbriae on P. gingivalis, FimA, targets TLR2, which promotes autophagic destruction of P. gingivalis. We conclude that DC-SIGN-TLR2 crosstalk determines the intracellular fate of this pathogen within dendritic cells, and may have profound implications for the treatment of many chronic diseases involving low-grade infections.","Porphyromonasis is a human monocyte-derived pathogen that is a major cause of human infections. The pathogen evades the immune system by evading the lectin-like receptors (PRRs) expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) and dendritic cells (DDCs).

The pheromone profile of insects is dynamic and can change depending on environmental, physiological, and social conditions. While many genes responsible for the biosynthesis of insect pheromones have been identified, much less is known about how pheromone production is systemically regulated over the lifetime of an animal. In this work, we identify 12 genes in Drosophila melanogaster that play a role in pheromone production. We characterized the function of one gene, which we name spidey, and which encodes a steroid dehydrogenase. Silencing spidey expression during the larval stage results in the rapid inactivation of an essential insect steroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone, and developmental arrest. In adults, spidey is needed for maintaining the viability of oenocytes, specialized cells that produce pheromones and also regulate energy homeostasis. Our work reveals a novel role for ecdysteroids in the adult animal and uncovers a regulatory mechanism for oenocyte activity. Potentially, ecdysteroid signaling serves as a mechanism by which environmental or social conditions shape pheromone production. Exploitation of this conserved pathway could be useful for interfering with the mating behavior and lifespan of disease-bearing insects or agricultural pests.","Cuticular lipids are lipids found in the cuticle of insects that communicate information about age, sex, and reproductive status to their oenocytes. In this study, we identified genes that control the production of cuticular lipids in Drosophila.

Conversely, inhibiting the gene expression of adulthood resulted in striking loss of oenocyte cells concomitant with reduction of cuticular hydrocarbons, desiccation resistance, and lifespan. We also found that inhibiting the gene expression of adulthood resulted in striking loss of oenocyte cells concomitant with reduction of cuticular hydrocarbons, desiccation resistance, and lifespan.",13.928333333333335

Every choice excluded a number of the disks accessible in the future, encouraging subjects to examine prospective paths as far into the future as they could. In contrast to previous evidence that humans tend to reduce the computational difficulty of decision making by means of simplifying heuristics, our participants appeared to perform an exhaustive computation of all possible future scenarios within a horizon limited by a fixed number of computations. Under increasing time pressure, participants either reduced the computational horizon or recalculated the expected rewards less frequently, revealing a resource-limited ability for rapid detailed computation of prospective actions.

Hair cells are susceptible to injury by noise, toxins, and other insults. In mammals, hair cells cannot be regenerated after injury, resulting in permanent hearing loss. Understanding genetic pathways that regulate hair cell development in the mammalian organ of Corti will help in developing methods to regenerate hair cells to treat hearing loss. Many genes are essential for hair cell and supporting cell development in the mouse organ of Corti. Among these are Sox2, Fgfr1, and Fgf20. Here, we investigate the relationship between these three genes to further define their roles in development. Interestingly, we found that Sox2 and Fgf20 interact to affect hair cell and supporting cell development in a spatially-graded manner. We found that cells toward the outer compartment and the base of the cochlea are more strongly affected by the loss of Sox2 and Fgf20.

However, a decades-long control campaign drastically reduced the number of infested houses, and the city is now in a stage where health personnel annually inspect a sample of houses throughout the city for kissing bug reinfestation. A large amount of information was collected during the control campaign that could be used to help identify the houses at highest risk for re-infestation, so we developed a cell phone app to provide this information to health personnel in the form of interactive, user-friendly risk maps. We carried out a pilot study to see if health personnel would use these maps to select houses to inspect for re-infestation, and we found that most inspectors did use the information. We also observed that using the app did not slow the inspectors down, which can be an issue when introducing new technology.

Their number varies from a few hundred in yeast cells to several thousands in human cells, distributed along the genome at comparable distances in both systems. An important question in the field is to understand how origins of replication are specified and regulated in the mammalian genome, as neither their location nor their activity can be directly inferred from the DNA sequence. Previous studies at individual origins and, more recently, at large scale across 1% of the human genome, have revealed that most origins overlap with transcriptional regulatory elements, and specifically with gene promoters. To gain insight into the nature of the relationship between active transcription and origin specification we have combined a genomic mapping of origins at 0.4% of the mouse genome with detailed studies of activation efficiency. The data identify two types of origins with distinct regulatory properties: highly efficient origins map at CpG island-promoters and low efficient origins locate elsewhere in association with transcriptional units. We also find a remarkable parallel organisation of the replication initiation sites and transcription start sites at efficient promoter-origins that suggests a prominent role of transcription initiation in setting the efficiency of replication origin activation.","Genomic mapping of DNA replication origins (ORIs) in mammals provides powerful means to understand regulatory complexity in the genome.

Hyperlongevity strong age-1(mg44 ) mutants result inability reset molecular switch reproductive mode .","Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) impacts development, metabolism, and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. It has been viewed as a cascade of kinase reactions, chiefly phosphorylation of other kinases, leading to inactivation of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. PI3K, a phosphatidylinositol kinase at the center of this pathway, converts PIP2 to PIP3, instrumental to kinase docking and activation. Here we show that PI3K deficiency elicits transcriptional inhibition of many kinases, including those of IIS itself. This creates a positive-feedback loop, wherein DAF-16/FOXO silences expression of the very kinases that would have inactivated it. In the resulting “flip-flop” genetic switch, either kinase signaling or transcriptional silencing may predominate. We discovered the transcriptional arm of this switch in infertile age-1(mg44) mutants, defective for PI3K activity. The absence of PIP3 and PIP3-dependent kinase activity gives free rein to gene silencing by DAF-16/FOXO. This two-tiered response could scarcely have evolved for the benefit of a sterile mutant; some components presumably serve regulatory functions in normal animals, reinforcing a switch responsive to environmental and internal signals. In age-1(mg44) mutants, complete inactivation of PI3K “fuses” the switch, locking worms into longevity mode. With signaling profoundly silenced, they cannot resume reproduction, but instead acquire a remarkable capacity for individual survival.","The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism for the regulation of metabolism and aging. In this study, we show that a nematode gene encodes a class- catalytic PI3 K, which is required for the activation of the DAF-16/ FOXO transcription factor.

Chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for leishmaniasis. First-line therapies include pentavalent antimonials, except in some regions in the Indian subcontinent, the liposomal formulation of amphotericin B, miltefosine and paromomycin. The WHO has recently recommended a combined therapy in order to extend the life expectancy of these compounds. However, resistance could be induced in Leishmania if this approach is not applied in a controlled and regulated way, thus resulting in a rapid loss of efficacy of not one but two therapeutic options. In light of this, we have designed relevant experimental studies in order to determine whether Leishmania parasites are able to develop resistance to the different potential anti-leishmanial drug combinations that will be used in the near future. The results obtained could help us to predict the success of drug combination therapy. Experimental resistance of Leishmania donovani promastigotes to drug combinations was obtained after 10 weeks and remained in the intracellular amastigotes. We therefore conclude that L. donovani can easily develop resistance to drug combinations mainly miltefosine/paromomycin and SbIII/paromomycin.

Senescence, which is triggered by the loss of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes (telomeres), is often seen as an example of a regular “biological clock.” However, cell senescence is heterogeneous, with large differences in lifespan between individual cell lineages. This heterogeneity is clearly related to stress, specifically oxidative stress. It was not known, however, whether stress-induced “premature” senescence involves telomeres or is caused by telomere-independent DNA damage responses. Mitochondria are the most important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells under physiological conditions. We found that mitochondrial function deteriorated while cells approached senescence, leading to increased ROS production. Delaying mitochondrial dysfunction led to postponed replicative senescence and slowing of telomere shortening. Prematurely senescing cells sorted out of young cultures displayed mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and short telomeres. We propose that replicative telomere-dependent senescence is not “clocked,” but rather is a stochastic process triggered largely by random mitochondrial dysfunction.","The replicative senescence process is a hallmark of aging, a hallmark of the heterogeneity of organisms, cell types, clonal populations, identical environments, and the heterogeneity understood.

Further, rapidly dividing tumor cells in an inflammatory microenvironment can also acquire mutations, which have been shown to contribute to drug resistance and disease recurrence.

Here we show that peripheral blood samples from multiple studies can be described by nine common axes of variation that collectively explain up to one half of all transcriptional variance in blood. Specific axes diverge according to environmental variables such as lifestyle and infectious disease exposure, but a strong genetic component to axis regulation is also inferred. As few as 10 “blood-informative transcripts” (BITs) can be used to define each axis and potentially classify individuals with respect to multiple aspects of their blood and immune function. The analysis of longitudinal profiles of one individual shows how these change relative to clinical shifts in metabolic profile following viral infection. The notion that gene expression diverges along genetic paths of least resistance defined by these axes has important implications for interpreting differential expression in case-control studies of disease.","In this study, we used a novel approach to capture the co structure of peripheral blood gene expression using a novel gene expression profiling technique called “Conservation Axes.” We identified more than 1,000 co-regulated genes in a new dataset of 189 healthy adult participants from the Emory-Georgia Tech Health Discovery-CHDWB cohort.

As a case study, we focus on ecological metapopulations, which may be viewed as a set of distinct subpopulations (/sites) that are connected via a dispersal network of arbitrary complexity. Metapopulation persistence is found to depend critically on the topology of cycles, and cyclical components in the connectivity network, because they allow the offspring of the population to eventually “return home” to the sites from which they originated. The methodology identifies critical migration routes, whose presence are vital to overall stability, and are thus of high conservation priority – information that may be of value when designing networks of marine protected areas. In contrast, links that do not participate in a cyclical component have no impact on persistence and thus have low conservation priority. While network theory is highly fashionable in biology, only few studies go deeper than descriptive statistical applications as attempted here. Moreover, the key results are easily extended to other biological contexts (e.g., disease networks), particularly in situations whereby the network controls the dynamics of a complex system.","The persistence of large biological systems is one of the most fundamental questions in ecology. Recent advances in network theory have brought new insights into the complex relationships between complex systems and their stability.

During these initial stages of development there is little or no transcription of the zygotic genome, and maternally deposited products control this process. Among the essential maternal products are mRNAs that encode transcription factors required for preparing the zygotic genome for transcriptional activation. This ensures that there is a precisely coordinated hand-off from maternal to zygotic control. In Drosophila melanogaster, the transcription factor Zelda is essential for activating the zygotic genome and coupling this activation to the degradation of the maternally deposited products. Nonetheless, the mechanism by which Zelda functions remains unclear. Here we used Cas9-mediated genome engineering to determine the functional requirements for highly conserved domains within Zelda. We identified a domain required specifically for Zelda’s role in reprogramming the early embryonic genome, but not essential for its functions later in development. Surprisingly, this domain restricts the ability of Zelda to activate transcription. These data demonstrate that Zelda activity is tightly regulated, and we propose that precise regulation of both the timing and levels of genome activation is required for the embryo to successfully transition from maternal to zygotic control.","The Drosophila melanogaster is the most common fruit fly in the world.

The model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also capable of filamentous growth in certain conditions, and previous work has identified a key transcriptional complex required for filamentation in both species. However, here we discover that the circuitry governed by this complex in C. albicans is largely distinct from that in the non-pathogenic S. cerevisiae.

The conventional wisdom is that in bacteria such as E. coli, initiation occurs when sufficient active form of the initiator protein accumulates. The same scenario possibly applies to V. cholerae Chr1, whose replication in turn determines the timing of replication of its second chromosome, Chr2. This is because Chr2 replication initiation depends on the replication of a site, crtS, in Chr1. Here we show that the crtS site has significant activity towards triggering Chr2 replication without itself being replicated. We propose that the doubling of crtS copy number, normally afforded by replication, allows accumulation of enough active Chr2-specific initiator to trigger initiation. The study provides a novel example of how the timing of a gene function can be controlled by the timing of its duplication.","Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that infects humans and animals, has multiple chromosomes that are required for replication.

ARG activity main marker disease severity .","Over the past decades, there has been a significant improvement in the understanding of immune responses against infection with pathogenic Leishmania spp. and the pathogenesis of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the mouse models. Leishmania parasites infect macrophages that can be activated via two major pathways resulting in classical and alternative activated macrophages which metabolize L-arginine differentially. Classically activated macrophages upregulate the enzyme inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and alternatively activated macrophages upregulate the arginase (ARG). ARG hydrolyzes the conversion of its substrate (L-arginine) to L-ornithine and urea. L-ornithine is a key intermediate substrate for the biosynthesis of polyamines, which are crucial nutrients for cellular processes such as growth, differentiation and proliferation of host cells and Leishmania parasites. Leishmania parasites may partly activate ARGs and inactivate the NO production by the host cells and enhance parasite survival via depletion of the iNOS substrate (L-arginine) and reduce NO levels. In this study, we tested the activity of this enzyme in the promastigote forms of the pathogenic L. major and L. tropica, and non-pathogenic L. tarentolae in vitro and assessed the differences between the levels of ARG activity in THP1 cells infected with different Leishmania spp. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between excessive ARG activity and lesion development in susceptible BALB/c and resistant C57BL/6 mice infected with virulent L. major, L. tropica and non-virulent L. tarentolae parasites and its impact on parasite burden during the development of infection. Our results show that ARG is highly upregulated in all pathogenic promastigotes as compared to non-pathogenic L. tarentolae and had a negative correlation between production of ARG and NO. We showed that during the development of the infection in susceptible BALB/c and resistant C57BL/6 mice, ARG is induced in both strains of mice infected with pathogenic Leishmania but not in non-pathogenic counterparts. These results suggest that ARG activity of Leishmania is essential for parasite survival in vitro and in vivo that directly regulates its growth and replication inside the host cells; therefore, it can be used as a significant marker of disease severity in CL and possible tools for drug designing.","Proliferation of Leishmania parasites depends on polyamine availability, which is generated by the enzyme arginase (ARG) in the host.

Translating these instructions allows us to better understand the connection between these mutations and disease. RNA-binding proteins (RBP) perform this translation by recognizing particular “phrases” that occupy short regions of the transcript. Recognition occurs by the binding of the RBP to the phrase. The set of phrases bound by a particular RBP is defined by the RNA base content of the binding site as well as the 3D configuration of these bases. Because it is impossible to assess RBP binding to every possible phrase, we have developed a mathematical model called RNAcontext that can be trained by measuring RBP binding strength on one set of phrases. Once trained, this model can then be used to accurately predict binding strength to any possible phrase. Compared to previously described methods, RNAcontext learns a more precise description of the 3D shapes of binding sites. This precision translates into more accurate generalization of RBP binding preferences to new phrases and allows us to make new discoveries about the binding preferences of well-studied RBPs.","Metazoan genomes encode hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that regulate post- gene expression and numerous cellular processes.

We and others had shown that LCMV and LASV attach to a cellular receptor, α-dystroglycan, followed by internalization by endocytosis via a novel and unusual pathway. Here we investigated the largely unknown molecular mechanisms of cell entry of LASV and LCMV with the goal to identify host cell factors involved. We discovered that during cell entry LASV and LCMV pass through a particular intracellular compartment, the multivesicular body (MVB)/late endosome, which is implicated in the internalization and degradation of cellular membrane receptors.

Here we have dissected the dependency relationships between molecules in the pathway by combinatorial gene knockout and ectopic expression, as well as by detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of one component. Our results provide a first analysis of the signal pathway architecture, revealing that it is non-linear. Moreover, phosphoproteome analysis reveals pathway hierarchy through identifying that the phosphorylation of a NEK kinase component of the pathway is reduced when a predicted upstream kinase is absent.

An intuitive hypothesis to explain the ability of these different proteins to recognize the same partner is that they display the same local region for interaction, in other words, they imitate the same binding site. Here, we quantify the similarity between these putatively mimicking binding sites. We show that it is not statistically significant. We confirm this observation on the small sets of evolutionarily conserved residues. Our results suggest that different proteins that bind the same protein do not imitate binding sites, but probably target specific locations or residues at the binding site.","Protein-protein interaction is a fundamental problem in many biological processes.

The constant selection pressure from this predation promotes the evolution and dissemination of bacterial bacteriophage-resistance mechanisms. One family of protective systems causes the infected cell to undergo premature suicide, in an altruistic move that protects the clonal population of bacteria by blocking virus replication. We identified a means by which a bacteriophage counter-evolved to avoid one such system. This system relies on two components: a toxic part to kill the cell and an antidote that holds the toxin in check until required. The bacteriophage evolved sequences encoding mimics of the cellular antidote and expressed these mimics so that it could continue replicating without becoming a victim of the host's defensive system. Furthermore, this evolved bacteriophage was able to transfer the DNA encoding the defence system to a new bacterial host. In so doing, the evolved bacteriophage may have indirectly created populations of host cells inside which it could productively replicate, while also providing the host better protection from competing predators.","Abortive infection is the most common cause of death in humans and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Microscopic imaging has shown how viral proteins and virus particles move within and between cells, accumulating at sites of cell-cell contact. While we suspect that these images represent virus infection, it has been difficult to accurately quantify virus replication and provirus formation in most cell-to-cell infection experiments. Retroviral vectors that encode reporter proteins have been invaluable tools for analyzing retrovirus replication and restriction, but they have had limited utility in cell-to-cell infection studies due to high background noise resulting from reporter expression in the producer cells. We report the construction and characterization of retroviral vectors that express reporter protein exclusively in target cells and only after completing a full replication cycle. We have validated this approach and have begun to analyze cell and virus determinants for cell-to-cell infection with vectors for two human retroviruses that infect T cells. We show that the mechanism of transmission and ensuing virus replication depend on the particular virus, the effector and target cell types, and on the specific type of cell-cell interaction.","HIV-1 is the most common human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the world. The virus is transmitted from one person to another via a cell-to-cell transfer of HIV-1 from one person to another.

Effector cells transfected the reporter vector, packaging the vector, and Env expression produced virus-like particles transduced by reporter gene cocultured target cells zero background.

The pathogen accomplishes this by secreting an arsenal of proteins, termed effectors, that function to modify host cells. Although hundreds of candidate effectors have been identified in P. infestans, their roles in pathogenicity or virulence remains basically unknown. Our results showed that one of these effectors functions to turn off resistance mediated by the potato gene RB. This effector accomplishes this by directly interacting with RB, which likely modifies its ability to turn on host resistance. Further molecular analysis identified two amino acids within the effector that determine interaction, which can assist in developing appropriate disease control strategies.","Phytophthora infestans, a pathogen that causes potato late blight, is a major threat to potato production worldwide.

We present a comprehensive computational study of molecular mechanisms of kinase activation by cancer-causing mutations. Using a battery of computational approaches, we have systematically investigated the effects of clinically important cancer mutants on dynamics of the ABL and EGFR kinase domains and regulatory multi-protein complexes. The results of this study have illuminated common and specific features of the activation mechanism in the normal and oncogenic forms of ABL and EGFR. We have found that mutants with the higher oncogenic activity may cause a partial destabilization of the inactive structure, while simultaneously facilitating activating transitions and the enhanced stabilization of the active conformation. Our results provided useful insights into thermodynamic and mechanistic aspects of the activation mechanism and highlighted the role of structurally distinct conformational states in kinase regulation. Ultimately, molecular signatures of activation mechanisms in the normal and oncogenic states may aid in the correlation of mutational effects with clinical outcomes and facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies to combat kinase mutation-dependent tumorigenesis.","Cancer is the most common cause of death in humans, and mutations in protein kinases are the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

Unfortunately this is not possible without a 24-month laboratory follow-up, which is problematic and largely unaccomplished in the field reality. Studies that assessed early indicators have used small cohorts, yielding limited statistical power plus potential bias because of including patients with equivocal outcome. We tackled this problem by pooling a large dataset which allowed for selecting cases providing strictly unequivocal information, still numerous enough to produce sound statistical evidence. We studied predictors based on the CSF leucocytes count, a laboratory technique already available in the field, evaluating their predictive power at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. We found a predictor at 6 months (10 leucocytes/µL of CSF) that has sub-optimal accuracy but may be valuable in some particular situations, plus two-step algorithms at 6 and 12 months that offer sufficient confidence to shorten the patients' follow-up. Until better biomarkers are identified, these findings represent a significant advance for this neglected disease. Benefits are foreseen both for patients and for overburdened treatment facilities.

To develop an oncolytic therapy for treating patients with EBV-associated cancers, we need a method to efficiently induce synthesis of lytic EBV proteins. The EBV protein encoded by its immediate-early BZLF1 gene usually mediates the switch into lytic viral infection. We show here that HIF-1α, a cellular transcription factor that accumulates in cells when deprived of normal levels of oxygen, can induce lytic EBV infection. HIF-1α mediates this switch by directly binding to a specific sequence located within the BZLF1 gene promoter, activating its expression. Importantly, we also show that deferoxamine, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits degradation of HIF-1α, can induce synthesis of lytic EBV proteins in some EBV-positive epithelial and lymphocytic cell lines.

The most distinctive visible feature of many neurons is the extensively branched network of cable-like projections that make up their dendritic tree. A neuron receives current-inducing synaptic contacts from other cells across its dendritic tree. As in the case of botanical trees, dendritic trees are strongly tapered towards their tips. This tapering has previously been shown to offer a number of advantages over a constant width, both in terms of reduced energy requirements and the robust integration of inputs at different locations. However, in order to predict the computations that neurons perform, analytical solutions for the flow of input currents tend to assume constant dendritic diameters. Here we introduce an asymptotic approximation that accurately models the current transfer in dendritic trees with arbitrary, continuously changing, diameters. When we then determine the diameter profiles that maximise current transfer towards the cell body we find diameters similar to those observed in real neurons. We conclude that the tapering in dendritic trees to optimise signal transmission is a fundamental architectural principle of the brain.","In the brain, the dendritic tree is an essential part of the architecture of the brain. The dendritic tree is a network of synapses that link the brain to the outside world. The dendritic tree is a prerequisite for computation of the brain.

Ty21a also failed to significantly protect against infection suggesting our model was particularly stringent. We discovered that anti-Vi antibodies, present in some individuals prior to vaccination, contributed significantly to preventing infection in some individuals, and when this effect was taken into account, M01ZH09 halved the risk of developing typhoid after being challenged.

This could include preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for migrants and young women in areas of severe food insecurity.Likewise, HIV programs that provide social and economic support to young women as part of an HIV prevention strategy should consider targeting areas affected by drought.Further studies should be done in other settings to investigate the external validity of these findings, particularly in terms of the impact on HIV in young women.","The impact of drought on HIV transmission is not well understood. Previous analyses of the impact of drought on HIV transmission in Africa have demonstrated that 11 % greater prevalence of HIV-endemic rural areas attributable to local rainfall shocks. In this study, we conducted a population-based HIV impact assessment in Lesotho to re-evaluate the relationship between drought and HIV transmission. We interviewed 12,887 adults, 93.5 % ( 12,052) of whom lived in areas that experienced drought, and 520 rural areas, 315 urban areas.

This trend was shown not only by studying gene expression in single cells (Bahar et al. 2006), but at the coarse tissue resolution as well (Somel et al. 2006; Li et al. 2009). These led us to believe that looking at absolute changes in expression level alone may not tell the whole story of transcriptional changes in age. Instead the story may be in the more subtle changes in the coordination of expression among multiple genes. For this reason, we decided to look at changes in co-expression relationships with age. To this end, we developed a methodology for differential co-expression network analysis for the comparison gene co-expression on a global scale. We applied this methodology to compare co-expression between young (16-month) and old (24-month) mice. This allowed us to find both gene groups whose coordination appear to be affected by age and to propose potential mechanisms for the change. We believe our work is of broad importance because it represents a different paradigm for looking not only at aging but also at any complex condition or disease—away from changes in individual genes towards changes in gene relationships.","Gene co-expression networks are networks of genes that interact with each other to express genes. We have developed a method for differential analysis of gene co-expression networks that allows us to look at large-scale changes in the aging of mice.

The co-evolution of myxoma virus and the European rabbit following the introduction of the virus into Australia in 1950 is the canonical case of host jumping and host-pathogen co-evolution on a continental scale. This natural experiment was repeated with the release of a separate strain of myxoma virus in Europe. On both continents moderately attenuated strains of virus became dominant while rabbits were selected for resistance to myxomatosis. Here we examine the genotypic and phenotypic evolution of myxoma virus in Great Britain compared to Australia and show that despite ecological convergence and equivalent evolutionary rates, the virus has followed distinct evolutionary pathways on both continents with few shared mutations. Furthermore, we reveal novel mechanisms of pathogenesis and tissue tropism compared to the progenitor virus, and that the disruption of virulence genes is compatible with high virulence. This suggests that mutations have occurred that can compensate for the loss of virulence genes driven by the nexus between virulence and transmission in an ongoing host-pathogen arms race.","Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a multi-pathogen, multi-drug-resistant pathogen that causes a wide range of diseases in humans and animals.

However, under unfavourable environmental conditions plants also need to finance adaptive responses to ensure their survival. For this purpose a growth regulatory system is required to dynamically tune plant growth according to the plants’ prevailing energy status. Here, we characterize crucial components of this system that link plants’ energy management with root growth control. In detail, we demonstrate that a highly homologous group of energy-controlled regulators of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family redundantly operate under energy deprivation to control expression of a determinant of hormonally-controlled meristematic root growth. By these means these regulators constitute a central hub to integrate detrimental environmental stress conditions, which converge on energy limitation, into plant growth. Understanding the interplay between the plants’ energy homeostasis and growth control are of major importance for future strategies to engineer efficient crop plants.","Plants control energy to ensure survival fitness constantly changing environmental conditions.

Several studies reported lack of correlation between the categories of the conventional classification and the disease severity. As a consequence, the World Health Organization proposed in 2008 a new classification that divides dengue into two categories: non-severe and severe dengue; the non-severe dengue is further divided into two categories: dengue with warning signs and dengue without warning signs. In this retrospective study we reviewed 357 cases of dengue diagnosed in our institution over a 4-year period to assess the validity of the new dengue classification in order to develop pragmatic guidelines for case triage and management in the Emergency Departments. We found that the sensitivity of the new classification for identifying severe cases was limited even though it had a higher sensitivity for identifying patients who needed advanced healthcare compared to the old one.

Anterograde and retrograde signals together with trans-synaptic complexes enable intercellular communications. How synapse activity status is monitored and relayed across the synaptic cleft remains poorly understood. The Drosophila NMJ is a very powerful genetic system to study synapse development. BMP signaling modulates NMJ growth via a canonical, Smad-dependent pathway, but also synapse stability, via a noncanonical, Smad-independent pathway. Here we describe a novel, noncanonical BMP pathway, which is genetically distinguishable from all other known BMP pathways. This pathway does not contribute to NMJ growth and instead influences synapse formation and maturation in an activity-dependent manner. Specifically, phosphorylated Smad (pMad in flies) accumulates at active zone in response to active postsynaptic type-A glutamate receptors, a specific receptor subtype. In turn, synaptic pMad functions to promote the recruitment of type-A receptors at synaptic sites. This positive feedback loop provides a molecular switch controlling which flavor of glutamate receptors will be stabilized at synaptic locations as a function of synapse status. Since BMP signaling also controls NMJ growth and stability, BMP pathway offers an exquisite means to monitor the status of synapse activity and coordinate NMJ growth with synapse maturation and stabilization.","The motor neurons of the Drosophila melanogaster are responsible for regulating the growth of the synapse, a network of cells that connects the brain to the rest of the body. BMP signaling is critical for the growth and maturation of the synapse, and is regulated by a noncanonical BMP pathway. Here, we describe a novel noncanonical BMP pathway characterized by accumulation of the effector, phosphorylated Smad (pMad), at synaptic sites. We show that the accumulation of pMad reduces postsynaptic levels of type- and type-receptors, revealing a positive feedback loop that appears to stabilize the activity of active type- and type-receptors at synaptic sites.

Sensing host-derived signals precedes adaptation, and triggers switching to the virulent state. Within mammalian cells L. monocytogenes responds to branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) deficiency by inducing virulence gene expression. In this study, we provide compelling evidence that fine tuning BCAA biosynthesis in L. monocytogenes allows the bacteria to sense isoleucine as a host-specific signal. Tightly controlled BCAA production depends on Rli60, a riboregulator, which is transcribed upstream to the BCAA biosynthesis genes. Rli60 functions as a ribosome mediated attenuator that cis-regulates BCAA production under limiting conditions.

It is thus vital to understand the assembly mechanisms of these particles and to apply rational-oriented strategies for the manipulation of the host system and/or process conditions. In this context, mathematical models built on stability, kinetic and thermodynamic principles of protein macrostructures and respective assembly pathways are key elements. Indeed, using mathematical and thermodynamic concepts as building blocks, the model herein postulated provides valuable insights about the feasibility of VLP production systems. It demonstrates that the formation of complete and theoretically biological active VLP is restricted to a narrow range of volatile macro and micro physicochemical environments as well as intracellular protein expression rates.

In this study, we identified a new bimodal switch controlling the expression of genes involved in flagellum biosynthesis and host interactions in the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila. This switch is modulated by a transcriptional regulator called FliZ. In addition to identifying all the specific genes up- and downregulated by FliZ, we showed that the concentration of FliZ fine-tuned the expression of FliZ target genes, resulting in individuals with different potentials for bacterial locomotion, host colonization and virulence.","Xenorhabdus nematophila is an insect pathogen that is a major cause of zoonotic diseases in humans and animals. The flagellar circuit is a complex of genes that control the motility of the insect.

FliZ, a DNA-binding protein, plays a key role in the regulation of flagellar virulence in Xenorhabdus nematophila, affecting hemolysin production and the efficient swimming of the insect.

The acute phase is asymptomatic in the majority of the cases and rarely causes inflammation of the heart or the central nervous system. Most infected patients progress to a chronic phase, characterized by cardiac or digestive involvement when not asymptomatic. However, when patients are also exposed to an immunosuppressant (such as chemotherapy), neoplasia, or other infections such as HIV, T. cruzi infection may develop into a severe disease (Chagas disease reactivation) involving the heart and central nervous system. The current microscopic methods for diagnosing Chagas disease reactivation are not sensitive enough to prevent the high rate of death observed in these cases. Therefore, we propose a quantitative method to monitor blood levels of the parasite, which will allow therapy to be administered as early as possible, even if the patient has not yet presented symptoms.","Reactivation of chronic Chagas disease, occurs approximately 20 % of patients coinfected with HIV/Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), commonly characterized by severe meningoencephalitis myocarditis.

Specific LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) tests for HAT have been developed and represent a significant step forward in the search for simple, sensitive and reliable diagnosis. Easy, accurate and reliable methods to read the results of these tests are critical and several simple methods have been developed. In this study, four methods were compared including three different colour change methods, and one in which the reaction turned from clear to cloudy.

We begin with a computational model of cortical tissue and seek to understand its input/output transformations. Our approach limits confirmation bias, and differs from a more constructionist approach of starting with a computational theory and then creating a model that can implement its necessary features. We here choose a population-level modeling technique that does not sacrifice accuracy, as it well-approximates the mean firing-rate of a population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We extend this approach to simulate recurrently coupled neural populations, and characterize the computational properties of the Potjans and Diesmann cortical column model. We find that this model is capable of computing linear operations and naturally generates a subtraction operation implicated in theories of predictive coding. Although our quantitative findings are restricted to this particular model, we demonstrate that these conclusions are not highly sensitive to the model parameterization.","In the brain, the cortex is a network of neurons that perform a wide range of cognitive functions, including sensory perception, memory, coordination of motor output, and motor control.

At the molecular scale, it is understood that adaptation should induce more genetic changes at amino acid altering sites in the genome, compared to amino acid–preserving sites. The ratio of substitution rates at such sites, denoted dN/dS, is therefore commonly used to detect proteins undergoing adaptation. This test was originally developed for application to distantly diverged genetic sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions along independent evolutionary lineages. Nonetheless, the dN/dS statistics are also frequently applied to genetic sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent transient polymorphisms, not substitutions. Here, we show that the behavior of the dN/dS statistic is very different in these two cases. In particular, when applied to sequences from a single population, the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to the strength of natural selection, and the anticipated signature of adaptive evolution, dN/dS>1, is violated. These results have implications for the interpretation of genetic variation sampled from a population. In particular, these results suggest that microbes may experience substantially stronger selective forces than previously thought.","Evolutionary pressures are measured by the ratio of a protein’s amino acid substitutions to its amino acid substitutions.

We have found that even when helper CD4 T cells are profoundly reduced in a mouse model that mimics this defect in AIDS, other remaining T cells are capable of mounting vaccine immunity against a deadly fungal infection, and they do so by producing the powerful, soluble product, IL-17. It has been widely believed that the activation and instruction of such cells, called Tc17 cells, is governed by another population of immune cells in the body, but we have found here that pathways within these Tc17 cells themselves mediate their activation and ability to produce the IL-17 needed for resistance to infection. We have also identified elements of the circuitry controlling this pathway—elements called MyD88, Akt1 and mTOR—and found that they control the production of IL-17 and not other products such as IFN-γ often produced by these cells. Further, we determined that this circuitry controls the development of Tc17 cells by regulating their ability to divide and expand. Thus, in a mouse model of vaccination against lethal fungal pneumonia caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis, we uncovered an important cellular arsenal that can be recruited to bolster resistance against a fungal infection, and identified novel ways in which the cells develop and expand into potent killers of fungi.","Fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

In the past, many approaches have looked for deterministic motifs in protein sequences, by searching for functionally over-represented k-mers, with moderate levels of success. Here we revisit and renew the utility of deterministic motifs, by searching for them in a partially unsupervised and context-dependent manner. Using a novel motif extraction algorithm, MEX, deterministic sequence motifs are extracted from Swiss Prot data containing more than 50,000 enzymes. They are then filtered by the Enzyme Commission classification hierarchy to produce sets of specific peptides (SPs). The latter specify enzyme function for 93% of the data, comparing well with existing approaches for enzyme classification. Importantly, SPs are found to have biological significance. A majority of all known active and binding sites of enzymes are covered by SPs, and many SPs are found to lie within spatial pockets in the neighborhood of the active sites.

This causes the relative enrichment of Wnt pathway proteins in the nuclei of repeatedly signaled cells, which we show likely impacts the activation of Wnt target genes. This represents a novel mechanism for the regulation of Wnt pathway targets in development and disease.","The Wnt signaling pathway plays a conserved role in animal development and regulation of distinct targets in different developmental contexts.

Here, we used a related parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, as a model system to investigate genes that might be involved in P. vivax drug resistance. Multiple P. vivax proteins were expressed and their location in P. knowlesi was explored using organellar markers. None of the candidates induced changes in parasite response to chloroquine or mefloquine, two front-line antimalarials for which resistance is a concern in P. vivax. This could be due to technical reasons, or could indicate that these genes do not actually play a role in resistance.

Mice lacking such LNs (called alymphoplastic) are severely immune compromised and resistant to immunizations. We discovered that the immune-deficiency of such alymphoplastic mice is actually not caused by the loss of LNs, but rather by the underlying genetic lesion. Surprisingly, mice lacking all lymph nodes can still mount potent T cell-mediated immune responses. We also discovered that T and B cells have completely different structural requirements for their activation/maturation. Whereas B cells rely on LNs to become efficient antibody-producing cells, T cells can be activated successfully outside of such dedicated tissues. So—in the absence of LNs—antigens delivered by immunization are actively transported into the liver where cellular immunity is initiated. The mammalian fetal liver is responsible for the early formation of blood and immune cells, and we propose that the adult liver can still provide a niche for T cell–antigen encounters. During evolution, T and B cells emerged simultaneously, allowing cold-blooded vertebrates (which lack LNs) to launch adaptive immune responses. The development of LNs in mammals coincided with a drastic improvement in antibody affinity maturation, whereas T cells remain LN-independent to this day.","Subcutaneous immunization delivers antigen (Ag) to local Ag-presenting cells subsequently migrate to draining lymph nodes (LNs) and initiate activation of expansion lymphocytes specific for Ag.

It has been speculated that membrane voltage fluctuations in neurons play an important role in scaling the relationship between input amplitude and spike rate response. For this to be true, neuronal spike input-output behavior must be sensitive to physiological membrane voltage fluctuations. Using a combination of single cell recordings and modeling, we investigated the mechanisms through which voltage fluctuations modulate neuronal input-output responses. We find that neurons that express an increase in membrane input resistance with depolarization show low levels of noise-mediated modulation of input-output responses due, in part, to voltage trajectories that suppress the likelihood of generating a spike in response to random current input fluctuations. Hence, non-linear membrane properties arising from certain types of voltage-gated conductances limit noise-based modulation of neuronal input-output responses.","The presence of voltage fluctuations arising from synaptic activity is a critical component of models of neuronal control. However, the degree of individual neuronal input-output functions modulated by voltage fluctuations is not well understood. Moreover, the extent to which voltage fluctuations are established in different cortical areas is limited by a lack of understanding of the role of non-linear voltage-dependent membrane properties. Here, we address this issue by studying fluctuation-based modulation of input-output responses in entorhinal cortical (MEC) stellate cells in rats. We show that stellate cells express strong sub-threshold non-linear membrane properties, which limit the ability of voltage fluctuations to elicit spikes. Furthermore, we show that fluctuation-based modulation of input-output responses in MEC stellate cells is limited by a lack of understanding of the role of non-linear voltage-dependent membrane properties.",13.436666666666667

In this article, we investigated a potential relationship between legume peptides and BacA in the establishment of prolonged bacterial-legume infections. We found that BacA was critical to protect bacteria against the antimicrobial action of legume peptides, thereby allowing the peptides to induce bacterial persistence within the legume rather than rapid bacterial death. Mammalian hosts also produce peptides in response to invading microorganisms and BacA proteins are critical for medically important bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis to form prolonged mammalian infections. Therefore, our results suggest that BacA-mediated protection against host peptides might be a conserved mechanism used by both symbiotic and pathogenic bacterial species to establish long-term host infections.","Sinorhizobium meliloti differentiates into two types of bacteroids: nitrogen-fixing bacteroids and nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. The nitrogen-fixing bacteroids are found in the root nodules of the legumes Medicago truncatula and Sinorhizobium meliloti, while the nitrogen-fixing bacteroids are found in the root nodules of the legumes Medicago truncatula and Sinorhizobium meliloti. Nodule-specific antimicrobial peptides (NCR AMPs) of bacterial BacA protein are essential for the development of bacteroids, but the role of BacA in the bacterial response to NCR AMPs is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of BacA in the bacterial response to NCR AMPs in S. meliloti and M. truncatula. We found that BacA reduces NCR AMP-induced membrane permeabilization in S. meliloti and M. truncatula, but not in M. truncatula. We also found that BacA dispensable bacterial survival in M. truncatula and M. truncatula dnf1 mutant mutants. These findings suggest that BacA is essential for the establishment of different prolonged host infections.",10.079053356282277

However, some strains of H. pylori express a bacterial secretion system, a sort of molecular syringe that injects a bacterial protein inside the gastric cells and causes inflammation that can lead to peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer. One of the essential components of the H. pylori secretion system is CagY, which is unusual because it contains a series of repetitive amino acid motifs that are encoded by a very large number of direct DNA repeats. Here we have shown that DNA recombination in cagY changes the protein motif structure and alters the function of the secretion system—turning it on or off. Using mouse and non-human primate models, we have demonstrated that CagY is a molecular switch that “tunes” the host inflammatory response, and likely contributes to persistent infection. Determining the mechanism by which CagY functions will enhance our understanding of the effects of H. pylori on human health, and could lead to novel applications for the modulation of host cell function.","Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes a wide range of clinical and non-clinical diseases, including gastric ulcers, gastric cancer, and peptic ulcer disease.

Expression noise can be disadvantageous, by affecting the precision of biological functions, but it may also be advantageous by enabling heterogeneous stress-response programs to environmental changes. Therefore various genes and gene groups might display various levels of expression noise. Importantly, gene expression is a multi-step process and the stochasticity of its individual steps, including transcription and translation, contributes to the resulting variability. Recent single cell analyses of gene expression in yeast have confirmed the theoretically predicted general trend where expression noise scales with protein abundance. However, some deviations from this basic trend have also been observed, prompting questions about the contribution of gene-specific features to such deviations. Accounting for noise heterogeneity in different gene groups, we revealed a clear relationship between noise and translation-related genomic features, specifically codon usage and 5′ UTR secondary structure. Our results suggest that the effect of translation on these deviations might be more prominent than previously appreciated, and provide important clues towards understanding expression stochasticity in yeast.","Expression noise is a common feature of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.

These include the need to protect itself against the toxic oxidants used by the host to kill invading microbes, and the need to scavenge iron, an essential micronutrient that is limiting in certain tissues. The iron-containing enzyme, catalase, detoxifies hydrogen peroxide, thereby playing a major role in protecting C. albicans against reactive oxygen species and neutrophil killing. Indeed, we show that high basal catalase expression increases the resistance of this yeast to oxidative and combinatorial (oxidative plus cationic) stresses. Yet, rather than enhancing the virulence of C. albicans as had been predicted, high basal catalase expression decreases fungal colonisation in certain iron-limiting tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that catalase inactivation does not significantly perturb the virulence of C. albicans in models of systemic infection. We also show that ectopic catalase expression increases the demand for iron in C. albicans, thereby reducing the fitness of this pathogen in the absence of stress under iron-limiting conditions. Therefore, high basal catalase expression is a double-edged sword: it enhances the fitness of C. albicans in the presence of stress, but reduces fitness in the absence of stress. This explains why catalase overexpression reduces rather than enhances virulence.","Candida albicans is a major cause of systemic candidiasis in humans.

In this study, DNA samples of adult worms from seven endemic municipalities were analyzed. Characterization of S. japonicum samples in different endemic sites with varying prevalence provides information on the genetic diversity of the parasite. Results of this study showed that samples in high prevalence endemic areas like Irosin, Catarman and Socorro were genetically diverse as compared to other areas. Information on parasite genetic diversity is therefore important in planning disease control strategies. The results suggest ongoing parasite transmission across geographic endemic areas which should be monitored and used as reference for genetic diversity of the schistosomes attributed to geographic areas, thus a safeguarding precaution should be implemented to ensure localized elimination of the disease.","Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasites Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni, which are transmitted by snails.

We are investigating multiple hybrid necrosis cases in Arabidopsis thaliana that are caused by allele-specific interactions between different variants at two unlinked resistance (R) gene clusters, RESISTANCE TO PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 7 (RPP7) and RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8)/HOMOLOG OF RPW8 (HR). The RPP7 locus encodes intracellular nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors that can confer strain-specific resistance to oomycetes, while the RPW8/HR locus encodes atypical resistance proteins, of which some can confer broad-spectrum resistance to filamentous pathogens. There is extensive structural variation in the RPW8/HR cluster, both at the level of gene copy number and at the level of C-terminal, 21- or 14-amino acid long RPW8/HR repeats. We demonstrate that the number of RPW8/HR repeats and the short C-terminal tail correlate, in an allele-specific manner, with the severity of hybrid necrosis when these alleles are combined with RPP7 variants.

For successful replication, pathogens have adapted metabolically to the intracellular niche. While this adaptation is fundamental to the ability to cause disease, we know little about pathogen's intracellular metabolism and its association with virulence. In this study we took a global approach that combines computational and experimental methods to decipher the intracellular metabolic requirements of the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We identified 12 metabolic pathways to be differentially active during infection in comparison to growth in rich lab media. We validated the essentiality of the active pathways for L. monocytogenes intracellular replication. Pathways included: biosynthesis of histidine, arginine, purine, and branch chain amino acids (BCAAs), as well as the catabolism of L-rhamnose and glycerol. Next we analyzed whether the requirement for these nutrients associates with virulence. We found that limiting concentrations of BCAAs, primarily of isoleucine, results in robust induction of the bacterial virulence state, a response that is dependent on the isoleucine responsive regulator, CodY. CodY was responsible for the up-regulation of the major virulence regulator of L. monocytogenes, PrfA. This study supports the premise that pathogens metabolism and virulence are closely interlinked.","Listeria monocytogenes is a major cause of food-borne illness in the United States and is a major cause of zoonotic infections in humans.

In particular, it has often been assumed that population dynamics, controlled by ecological circumstances such as the presence of predators or disease, occur at such different timescales compared with evolutionary dynamics that they are effectively de-coupled. Recent studies, however, have found that evolution can occur over ecological timescales and thus may have important effects on ecological dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a tight coupling between population dynamics and the evolutionary dynamics of a “social” microbial gene, which allows a laboratory population of budding yeast to cooperatively break down sucrose and grow on the simpler sugars released from it. In such cooperative populations, evolution may favor non-cooperative, or “cheater” individuals that do not contribute to the public good (in this case, the products of sucrose break down), but still use that public good to grow at the expense of the individuals that do cooperate. Our study shows that a population of cooperators that is invaded by cheaters does not collapse as a result of cheater proliferation but can evolve to a viable equilibrium. However, the coexisting population is less resilient to perturbations.","Evolutionary spread of cheater strategies has been shown to destabilize populations engaging in social cooperative behavior, demonstrating evolutionary changes that have profound implications for population dynamics.

Innate immune cells are required to detect and contain infection while specific adaptive T cells are activated and recruited to infection sites. Adaptive immunity enhances the function of innate cells and also directly kills infected cells to prevent further bacterial propagation. These cells respond to local environmental cues and often communicate via direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we observed cellular dynamics in situ by imaging live tissue using intravital microscopy. We reconstituted the Lm infection model with bacteria and mouse strains engineered to express fluorescent proteins to label specfic cells. We find that dendritic cells (DC) in the spleen rapidly capture Lm from circulation, demonstrating a direct role of these cells in sequestering bacteria. Neutrophils converge on infected cells by directed migration to generate exanguinous foci within the otherwise blood rich red pulp. Finally, antigen specific CD8+ T cell interact extensively with infected cells and DC in the foci and are selectively retained compared to non-specific polyclonal T cells. These findings significantly advance our understanding of immune cell dynamics in the spleen in both the steady state and in response to Listeria infection. These studies could aid in development of disease therapies and vaccine strategies targeted towards enhancing DC, myelomonocytic and CD8+ T cell effector responses.","Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is an intracellular pathogen that causes a wide range of human diseases, including meningitis, pneumonia, and septicemia.

In contrast to previous experimental studies, which describe saturating relationships between ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, we show that in reef fish systems, functioning (as standing biomass) accelerates with the addition of new species. This non-saturating relationship implies unique contributions of species to the functioning of this ecosystem and indicates that the consequences of losing biodiversity are significantly greater than previously anticipated. We also demonstrate a negative effect of human density on reef fish functioning such that for the same number of people the loss of standing biomass is significantly larger in more diverse ecosystems. Unfortunately, human effects can arise through multiple stressors (such as fishing, coastal development, and land use) and are widespread and likely to worsen, as some 75% of the world's coral reefs are currently nearby human settlements and because almost all countries with coral reefs are expected to double their populations within the next 50 to 100 years. Our results call for both further investigation of the impact of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and strategies to manage and prevent the increasing intensity and expansion of anthropogenic stressors in coastal areas.","The loss of coral reefs is one of the most important environmental challenges facing the world today.

The parasite’s complex lifecycle includes sexual and asexual reproduction outside and inside the host, respectively. The parasite can also asexually complete a life cycle within the host's body, which is called autoinfection causing life-long infection. In order to investigate the population structure and transmission patterns of this parasite we sequenced individual nematodes isolated from human faeces in Japan and Myanmar, where the parasite is present at low and high frequencies, respectively. Whole genome sequencing of small parasites is generally difficult because the amount of DNA is limiting. However, we overcame this problem by combining whole genome amplification with next-generation sequencing. Sequence comparisons revealed 0.6% of the genome is variable among samples, and the variants showed clear separation by the location of their origin. We found that heterozygosity within the genomes was higher in Japan, which is likely explained by the predominance of asexual reproduction through auto-infection, suggesting that analyses of heterozygosity are required to better understand the history of a population.","The helminth Strongyloides stercoralis is one of the most common nematodes in the world.

One can model subject response by assuming that it results from combining noise and a response that is mathematically optimal given this noise, delay, and a least-squares sort of control objective. This modeling approach is appropriate for young and most elderly subjects. The model holds that increased noise should lead to no change in delay until response gets underway, but should make the response itself proceed at a slower speed. This is consistent with the data and with a causal link from the observed noise and disorder in elderly motor function to the observed age-related slowing.","In this study, we analyzed the age-related changes in motor response to perturbations in a visuomotor compensatory tracking task.

The ability of neutrophils to reach these sites, a key feature in the resolution of infections, is mediated by their capacity to sense and migrate directionally to the core of the inflammation site. Chemicals released at the site of inflammation are known as primary attractants. The binding of these attractants to receptors on the surface of neutrophils leads to the secretion of secondary attractants that amplify the reach of primary attractants. We studied the mechanism by which secondary attractants are released from neutrophils. We found that the secretion of a key secondary attractant is mediated in the form of small vesicles called exosomes. These exosomes originate inside the cells, encapsulated in larger vesicles called multivesicular bodies. We purified exosomes from activated neutrophils and show that they contain the machinery to synthesize this secondary attractant and act specifically to elicit neutrophil motility. The inhibition of exosome release leads to a loss of secretion of the secondary attractant as well as a loss in directional motility. Together, our findings provide insight into the mechanisms cells use to protect labile attractants from harsh extracellular environments and communicate directional cues during inflammatory responses.","Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a chemoattractant secreted by neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that is involved in the immune response.

This is ensured through the meiotic divisions, which initially fasten identical chromosomes through DNA linkages that hold them together until the cell is ready to separate them. To make these linkages, called crossovers, the cell breaks the DNA in many places, and must repair them to create a crossover, or a noncrossover. We investigate here the role of ZHP-4, and its partner ZHP-3 which form a complex that associates along paired chromosomes and finally with crossover sites. ZHP-3/4 are conserved proteins found in many organisms that function in recruiting proteins required to decide which DNA event will become a crossover and how this DNA event is coordinated with changes in chromosome structure. Using mutations that reduce the function of ZHP-4, we show that the complex cannot localize normally to meiotic chromosome and that crossing over fails. Our results suggest that ZHP-3/4 work at early and late steps in the process to stabilize other factors required for crossover formation.","Correct segregation of meiotic chromosomes depends on DNA crossovers (COs) that culminate in visible physical linkages called chiasmata.

We reconstruct the evolutionary history of this region among primates and show that the ancestral tandem gene family contracted to a single pseudogene within the ancestral lineage of apes and monkeys. Phylogenetic analyses support a model where the gene has been “dead” for at least 25 million years of human primate evolution but whose ORF became restored in all human and great ape lineages. We suggest that the rebirth or restoration of the gene coincided with the insertion of an endogenous retrovirus, which now serves as the functional promoter driving human gene expression.

Protein coding sequences have traditionally been the focus of these studies, as the genetic code enables a detailed study of the strength of selection acting on amino acid sequences. However, from the earliest cross-species sequence comparisons, it was clear that protein sequences among closely related species are too similar to explain the observed phenotypic diversity. This led to the hypothesis that the evolution of gene regulation has played a key role in generating diversity between species. The availability of numerous complete genome sequences has made it possible to begin testing this hypothesis. In this work, the authors use an evolutionary model to identify functional divergence within transcription factor binding sites, the core functional elements involved in gene regulation. Applying this model to the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its three closest relatives, the authors find that a substantial fraction of the ancestral binding sites have been lost in a species-specific manner. In some cases the loss of the binding site creates gene expression differences that may be indicative of species-specific changes in gene regulation. This work provides a useful computational framework that will allow further study of the conservation of cis-regulatory sequences and their role in molecular evolution.",Cis-regulatory sequences (cis-regulatory sequences) are conserved in all eukaryotic species. Divergence of cis-regulatory sequences results in evolution of species-specific patterns of gene expression that are flexible in nature and cis-regulatory code.

We find significant fraction functionally constrained binding sites lost lineage-specific manner closely related to yeast species.

To develop durable approaches to control aphids, it is critical to understand how aphids interact with plants at the molecular level. Aphid feeding induces plant defenses, which can be suppressed by aphid saliva. Thus, aphids can alter plant cellular processes to promote infestation of plants. Suppression of plant defenses is common in plant pathogens and involves secretion of effector proteins that modulate host cell processes. Evidence suggests that aphids, like plant pathogens, deliver effectors inside their host cells to promote infestation. However, the identity of these effectors and their functions remain elusive. Here, we report a novel approach based on a combination of bioinformatics and functional assays to identify candidate effectors from the aphid species Myzus persicae. Using this approach, we identified three candidate effectors that affect plant defense responses and/or aphid reproductive performance. Further characterization of these candidates promises to reveal new insights into the plant cellular processes targeted by aphids.","Aphids are devastating pests that feed on plants.

Similarly, multiple cells must be measured in order to understand health and disease in the organism.

QS is essential for virulence and biofilm formation in many bacteria including the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa has high clinical relevance because it has acquired resistance to commonly used antibiotics, and is a priority pathogen on the CDC ESKAPE pathogen list. The urgent need for new antimicrobials to combat P. aeruginosa infections makes targeting QS for interference an attractive approach. Here, we investigate P. aeruginosa under biofilm conditions that mimic authentic P. aeruginosa lifestyles in environmental and medical contexts rather than in traditional laboratory conditions. This strategy enabled us to find that P. aeruginosa uses a novel QS signal molecule that controls biofilm formation and virulence. The new signal molecule acts together with the long-known QS receptor RhlR. Using physiologic, genetic, and molecular studies, combined with animal models of infection, we characterize the roles of QS components in biofilm formation and virulence.

However, RSV is often not the only detectable pathogen, but co-infections with respiratory bacteria are common. It has been hypothesized that this results from epithelial damage caused by the virus, facilitating colonization by pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, an inverse order of events is not impossible: bacterial infections may activate respiratory epithelial cells through TLR signaling, resulting in increased susceptibility to virus infections. We tested this hypothesis by screening bacterial TLR agonists for their capacity to modulate RSV infection in different cell types, and identified the lipopeptide and prototype TLR1/2 agonist Pam3CSK4 as an enhancer of RSV infections. However, to our surprise this proved independent of TLR activation, but was mediated by enhancement of binding between virus and target cell. Two structurally related lipopeptides unable to stimulate TLR responses were identified that enhanced infections with RSV, but also with other enveloped viruses including HIV-1, human metapneumovirus, and measles virus.

To address this issue, we artificially reduced the concentration of 59 different transcription factors in the cell and then examined which genes were impacted by the reduced transcription factor level.

At the cellular level, the mammalian clockwork consists of a core Per/Cry negative feedback loop and additional interlocking loops. We wished to address experimentally the contribution of the interlocking Bmal1 loop to clock function in mammals. Because behavioral rhythms do not always reflect cell-autonomous phenotypes and are subject to pleiotropic effects, we employed cell-based genetic approaches and monitored rhythms longitudinally using bioluminescent reporters of clock gene expression. We showed that REV-ERB repressors play a more prominent role than ROR activators in regulating the Bmal1 rhythm. However, significant rhythmicity remains even with constitutive expression of Bmal1, pointing to the resilience of the core loop to perturbations of the Bmal1 loop.

The 2013–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most devastating Ebola outbreak to date resulting in over 28,600 identified human cases and 11,300 deaths. Though our knowledge of virus transmission is incomplete, we do know that transmission occurs through direct contact with virus-contaminated body fluids (blood, secretions, or other body fluids), materials such as bedding contaminated with these fluids, and through the handling and preparation of contaminated food. Asymptomatic Ebola virus infections that result in seroconversion in the absence of disease symptoms have been observed both in humans and experimentally in animal models. In the present serology study, we determined a majority of Ebola survivors in our cohort had measurable antibody levels against at least one viral antigen, as expected. In our cohort of close contacts, relatives and health care workers who took care of Ebola-infected individuals during the outbreak, we observed a rate of seroprevalence of 12.7% as indicated by detectable GP antibody levels. Given that Ebola virus is typically associated with a highly lethal disease in humans, it is of great interest to determine the host-virus interactions and transmission dynamics associated with asymptomatic cases.","The Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa in 2013–2016 was the largest outbreak of the disease in history. The Ebola virus is a highly infectious virus that can cause severe disease and death in humans. In this study, we conducted a serological study to examine the antibody levels of survivors of Ebola-infected individuals who took care of Ebola-infected individuals and developed symptoms of Ebola virus disease. We collected blood samples from 481 individuals in Makeni, Sierra Leone, who were survivors of Ebola-infected individuals who took care of Ebola-infected individuals and developed symptoms of Ebola virus disease. We found that 97.7 % of samples (209/214) were positive for antibodies against the Ebola virus. We also found that close contacts of Ebola-infected individuals who developed symptoms of Ebola virus disease had detectable antibodies against the Ebola virus. These findings suggest that close contacts of Ebola-infected individuals who took care of Ebola-infected individuals and developed symptoms of Ebola virus disease may have played a role in the dynamics of transmission.",15.016376695929772

The generation of these oscillations has so far only been investigated in generic one- and two-population networks, neglecting their embedment into larger systems. We introduce a method that determines the mechanisms and sub-circuits generating oscillations in structured spiking networks. Analyzing a multi-layered model of the cortical microcircuit, we trace back characteristic oscillations to experimentally observed connectivity patterns. The approach exposes the influence of individual connections on frequency and amplitude of these oscillations and therefore reveals locations, where biological mechanisms controlling oscillations and experimental manipulations have the largest impact. The new analytical tool replaces parameter scans in computationally expensive models, guides circuit design, and can be employed to validate connectivity data.","Oscillations are omnipresent in neural population signals, like multi-unit recordings, EEG/MEG, local field potential, and the local field potential of neurons. These oscillations are linked to firing rate of neurons, and individual neurons firing close-to-irregular fashion low rates. A layered microcircuit model V1 is composed of leaky integrate-fire neurons, which generate low-high- oscillations in the visible populations, and leaky integrate-fire neurons, which generate low-high- oscillations in the imposed populations.

This exceptional radioresistance results from many features including efficient DNA double strand break repair. Here, we examine genome stability in D. radiodurans before and after exposure to ionizing radiation. Rearrangements between repeated sequences are a major source of genome instability and can be deleterious to the organism. Thus, we measured the frequency of recombination between direct repeats separated by intervening sequences of various lengths in the presence or absence of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks. Strikingly, we showed that the frequency of deletions was as high in strains devoid of the RecA, RecF or RecO proteins as in wild type bacteria, suggesting a very efficient RecA-independent process able to generate genome rearrangements. Our results suggest that single strand annealing may play a major role in genome instability in the absence of homologous recombination.","Radioresistant bacteria, such as Deinococcus radiodurans, are known to be able to reconstruct the functional genome of radiation-induced chromosomal fragments.

Since both populations are active at the same time, space information has to be synchronized between the two. Both brain areas are reciprocally connected, and it is unclear how the two codes influence each other. In this paper, we analyze a theoretical model of how a place code processes inputs from the grid cell population. The model shows that the sparseness of the place code poses a much stronger constraint than maximal information transfer. We thus conclude that the potentially high spatial acuity of the grid code cannot be efficiently conveyed to a sparse place cell population and thus propose that sparseness and spatial acuity are two independent objectives of the neuronal place representation.","In the medial entorhinal cortex, a region of the brain that encodes spatial information, there are grid cells that feed and forward input place cells.

Ss prevalence remained high over the years in the areas with no MDA, while in those with MDA prevalence fell to zero, and remained very low 6 years after MDA cessation.

In order to gain more insight into the ultrastructure of the prototype FV (PFV) we performed (cryo-)electron tomography and microscopy of infected cells and of isolated virions. We find that PFV contains a nucleocapsid of constant dimensions at its center, an intermediate shell of protein positioned between the core capsid and the viral membrane and glycoprotein that arranges into regular hexagonal lattices on the virus membrane. Structural analysis of the glycoprotein was performed in situ to a resolution of 9Å, which shows regular helical features such as a trimeric coiled coil of the fusion protein subunit, a hallmark of class I fusion proteins, spacer arms between the glycoprotein trimers and the arrangement of six transmembrane helices, a characteristic feature of the PFV Env glycoprotein.

In response to growing interest in this endeavor, many forecasting frameworks have been developed for a variety of diseases. We ask whether an approach based on collective human judgment can be used to produce reasonable forecasts and how such forecasts compare with forecasts produced by purely data-driven systems. To answer this, we collected simple predictions in real-time from a set of expert and non-expert volunteers during the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 U.S. flu seasons and during the 2014–2015 chikungunya invasion of Central America, and we report several measures of accuracy based on these predictions.

Using DNA immunization we investigated the immune response induced by abundant proteins within the saliva of the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi. We found that one salivary protein protected while another exacerbated L. major infection, suggesting that the type of immune response induced by specific salivary proteins can prime and direct anti-Leishmania immunity.

A central function of circadian clocks is controlling the adaptive response to the daily cycle of light and darkness. As such, altering the clock (e.g., by jet lag or shiftwork) affects mental and physical health in humans. It has generally been thought that the underlying molecular mechanism of circadian oscillations is an autoregulatory transcriptional/translational feedback loop. However, in cyanobacteria, only three purified clock proteins can reconstitute a circadian rhythm of protein phosphorylation in a test tube (in vitro). Using this in vitro system we found that the three proteins interact to form complexes of different compositions throughout the cycle. We derived a dynamic model for the in vitro oscillator that accurately reproduces the rhythms of complexes and of protein phosphorylation. One of the proteins undergoes phase-dependent exchange of its monomers, and the model demonstrates that this monomer exchange allows the maintenance of robust oscillations. Finally, we perturbed the in vitro oscillator with temperature pulses to demonstrate the resetting characteristics of this unique circadian oscillator. Our study analyzes a circadian clockwork to an unprecedented level of molecular detail.","The daily rhythms of the human body are governed by the circadian clock, which is a 24-hour-long periodicity of temperature and light. The circadian clock displays the self-sustained 24-hour periodicity of temperature and light, as well as the self-sustained 24-hour periodicity of temperature and light. This self-sustained 24-hour periodicity of temperature and light is compensated by the self-sustained 24-hour periodicity of temperature and light.

Through the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE), we had the opportunity to compare the impact of school-based treatment in an area of western Kenya with moderate (10%-24%) initial prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infections. We found that providing MDA every year or every other year over a 4 year period provided similar benefits for reducing prevalence and intensity of infection in the final evaluation at year 5.

Here, we show that the signaling molecule calcium plays a central role for this migratory activation and that signal transduction is preferentially mediated through a subtype of voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav1.3). This study functionally implicates Cav1.3 channels in a, hitherto uncharacterized, calcium signaling axis by which dendritic cells are induced to become migratory.

When errors of prediction occur, models must be updated to ensure desired outcomes are still achieved. Neuromodulator chemicals provide a possible pathway for triggering such changes in brain state. One such neuromodulator, noradrenaline, originates predominantly from a cluster of neurons in the brainstem—the locus coeruleus (LC)—and plays a key role in behaviour, for instance, in determining the balance between exploiting or exploring the environment. Here we use Active Inference (AI), a mathematical model of perception and action, to formally describe LC function. We propose that LC activity is triggered by errors in prediction and that the subsequent release of noradrenaline alters the rate of learning about the environment. Biologically, this describes an LC-cortex feedback loop promoting behavioural flexibility in times of uncertainty. We model LC output as a simulated animal performs two tasks known to elicit archetypal responses. We find that experimentally observed ‘phasic’ and ‘tonic’ patterns of LC activity emerge naturally, and that modulation of learning rates improves task performance.

In the biological sciences hierarchical clustering has achieved a position of pre-eminence due to its ability to capture multiple levels of data granularity. Hierarchical clustering’s visual displays of phylogenetic trees and gene-expression modules are indeed seductive. Despite its merits, hierarchical clustering is greedy by nature and often produces spurious clusters, particularly in the presence of substantial noise. This paper presents a relatively new alternative to hierarchical clustering known as convex clustering. Although convex clustering is more computationally demanding, it enjoys several advantages over hierarchical clustering and other traditional methods of clustering. Convex clustering delivers a uniquely defined clustering path that partially obviates the need for choosing an optimal number of clusters. Along the path small clusters gradually coalesce to form larger clusters. Clustering can be guided by external information through appropriately defined similarity weights. Comparisons to hierarchical clustering demonstrate the superior robustness of convex clustering to noise. Our genetics examples include inference of the demographic history of 52 populations across the world, a more detailed analysis of European demography, and a re-analysis of a well-known breast cancer expression dataset. We also introduce a new algorithm for solving the convex clustering problem. This algorithm belongs to a subclass of MM (minimization-majorization) algorithms known as proximal distance algorithms. The proximal distance convex clustering algorithm is inherently parallelizable and readily maps to modern many-core devices such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Our freely available software, convexcluster, exploits OpenCL routines that ensure compatibility across a variety of hardware environments.","The primary goal of cluster analysis is to discover natural groupings of objects.

We present the experience of a Tropical Medicine Unit in a major European city, over a 19-year period, describing and comparing NTDs diagnosed amongst immigrants, travelers and travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs). NTDs were diagnosed outside tropical areas and occurred more frequently in immigrants, followed by VFR travelers and then by other travelers.

Issues focusing on modes of transmission outside endemic areas and how eradication programs for some NTDs in endemic countries may have an impact in non-tropical Western countries by decreasing disease burden in immigrants, are addressed.

A mismatch in the helix is recognized by MutS homologs and subsequent events include excision of the error-containing strand followed by re-synthesis. A critical step in this process is directing repair to the newly synthesized strand. Current data suggest that transient discontinuities in the DNA backbone, known as nicks, generated during replication serve as the strand discrimination signals. Additionally, proteins that package DNA have the capacity to block mismatch recognition and are known to rapidly assemble behind the replication fork. Thus, there must be a short window of opportunity for the mismatch recognition complexes to scan for mismatches and access the strand discrimination signals. To address these issues, we tested the model that the mismatch recognition complexes track with the replisome. We employed high resolution genomic methods to determine that during replication, the mismatch recognition complexes bind origins of replication and advances with the replisome. The findings support the hypothesis that the mismatch recognition proteins track with the DNA replication machinery to accurately survey and repair the newly synthesized strands while the DNA is unpackaged and strand specificity signals are accessible.","In eukaryotic cells, mismatch repair proteins recognize repair mispaired bases and escape proofreading activity of DNA.

Curiously, approximately 10% of protein kinases lack one or more catalytic residues, and these kinases have been termed pseudokinases. It has been proposed that some pseudokinases act as scaffolds, bringing together proteins involved in signalling networks. Here, we report the structure of the pseudokinase STRADα in complex with the adaptor protein MO25α; together these two proteins regulate the LKB1 tumour suppressor kinase. Despite lacking several key catalytic residues, STRADα binds ATP and adopts an active conformation typical of catalytically competent kinases. The affinity of STRADα for ATP is enhanced by MO25α and vice versa. We go on to demonstrate through mutagenesis studies that binding to both ATP and MO25α is essential for the activation of LKB1. Our data suggest that STRADα exerts its functions through an active conformation, not through actual catalytic activity, thus raising the possibility that pseudokinases regulate signalling networks by adopting different structural conformations.","Pseudokinases are a group of proteins that are involved in the regulation of signal networks. In the case of pseudokinases, they lack essential residues for kinase activity, emerging as important regulators of signal networks.

However, some common traits, such as cancer, can result from a minority of cells that adopted a special behavior. From one individual to another, DNA variants can modify the frequency of such cellular behaviors. The body of one of the individuals then harbours more misbehaving cells and is therefore predisposed to a macroscopic phenotypic change, such as disease. Such genetic effects are probabilistic, they contribute little to trait variation at the macroscopic level and therefore largely escape detection in classical studies. We have developed a novel statistical method that uses single-cell measurements to detect variants of the genome that have non-deterministic effects on cellular traits. The approach is based on a comparison of distributions of single-cell traits. We applied it to colonies of yeast cells and showed that it can detect mutations that change cellular morphology or molecular regulations in a probabilistic manner. This opens the way to study multicellular organisms from a novel angle, by exploiting single-cell technologies to detect genetic variants that predispose to certain diseases or common traits.","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an important tool for understanding genetic variation in the human genome.

Cellular adaptation to stress is essential to ensure organismal survival, and NRF2 is an exceptionally well-studied and key determinant of cellular stress responses that plays complex roles in cancer biology and responses to xenobiotics, including chemotherapies. Our studies have established a functional and evolutionarily conserved role for WDR23 as a substrate receptor for the Cullin4(CUL4)-DDB1 E3-ubiquitin ligase, which regulates NRF2 protein levels and activity, and which operates independently of the canonical KEAP1-CUL3 pathway. KEAP1 has been the most highly studied regulator of NRF2, as mutations in KEAP1, which result in uncontrolled activation of NRF2 and chemo-resistance, are found in many aggressive cancers. Importantly, increased expression of WDR23 in KEAP1(-/-) cancer cells restores aberrant NRF2 regulation. In the absence of a KEAP1-like system, C. elegans WDR-23 has been shown to regulate the worm cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1. We have leveraged C. elegans genetic approaches to identify conserved regulatory mechanisms of mammalian cytoprotection by NRF2. Collectively, our studies suggest control of NRF2 homeostasis is much more sophisticated than previously appreciated.","The NRF2 / NFE2L2 key determinant of xenobiotic stress responses and the loss of negative regulation of KEAP1 - CUL3 proteasome system is implicated in chemo- radiation-resistant cancers.

The absence of vaccines or prophylactic drugs for most of these diseases emphasizes the need for accurate sampling of mosquito vector populations and testing for arboviruses. Accurate surveillance is crucial for early warning of potential or assessing mitigation of existing outbreaks. However, it is a challenge to sample mosquitoes in adequate numbers during the inter-epidemic periods (IEP) because this period is characterized by low mosquito population densities, sporadic transmission foci and low mosquito infection rates. Therefore more efficient tools are needed to increase capture rates so maximized virus detection probability in the mosquitoes can be achieved for assessing risk and outbreak predictions. This can be accomplished by exploiting the host-seeking behavior of adult female mosquitoes and the olfactory cues used to locate a potential host. Here, odors emanating from fur of sheep, a susceptible host for RVFV, is shown to improve trap capture rates of mosquito vectors of RVF in a standard surveillance trap. These data provide for future investigations to identify attractive components present in these natural odors, so that they can be incorporated into existing traps to serve as a population density-monitoring tool for improved arbovirus disease surveillance during IEP.","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arboviral disease transmitted by mosquitoes and is a major public health problem in East Africa.

Recently, emergence of arboviral diseases caused by Zika and chikungunya viruses has also become a global concern. Knowledge about the ecology of mosquito populations under natural conditions may provide significant aid to help designing more effective vector control strategies. Quantitative metrics such as the abundance of mosquito populations are difficult to be measured in the field without resorting to experiments with markers. There are, however, limitations to these kinds of experiments such as short mosquito lifespan, marking limitations due to small body size, low efficiency in capturing devices such as traps, and once-only individual capture. Due to these limitations most methods estimate either only abundance or a combination of abundance and survivorship. In this work, we present statistical methods designed to estimate abundance, survivorship and recruitment using inference models and information such as counts of pupae. Results indicate that having low capture efficiencies as often observed in field assays still permits good estimation. Also, low number of released mosquitoes compromise density and survival estimations. We expect these methods to be helpful to people collecting mosquito field data and for health analysts to evaluate possible outcomes of control interventions.","Mosquito mark-release-recapture (MRR) is an important tool in the control of vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever, Zika virus, and yellow fever.

This is important because it prevents the production of potentially deleterious truncated proteins from aberrant mRNAs, such as those that have undergone erroneous processing. How does the cell discriminate aberrant mRNAs from those that are normal? Here we present evidence that in human cells, the targeting of an mRNA to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay depends on a competition between proteins associated with the mRNA 3′ UTR that stimulate or antagonize mRNA decay. We show that cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, a protein associated with the mRNA 3′ end poly(A) tail, antagonizes mRNA decay. By contrast, a protein complex deposited onto mRNAs upon pre-mRNA splicing, called the exon junction complex, stimulates mRNA decay. Our observations suggest that the competition between these proteins, and probably other unknown proteins with similar activities, determines whether a key protein complex in the pathway, the Upf complex, is recruited to the mRNA upon translation termination, which leads to mRNA decay.","The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway is a transcription factor involved in the translation of transcription factors into and out of the ribosome. In mammals, the transcription factor Upf interacts with eukaryotic translation release factors, eRF3 and eRF1, to trigger NMD translation termination. In eukaryotes, the transcription factor cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) interacts with eRF3 and eRF1 to trigger NMD translation termination. In contrast, the transcription factor cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) interacts with eRF3 and eRF1 to trigger NMD translation termination. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) inhibits the interaction of eRF3 and eRF1 with the Upf complex terminating the ribosome.

Examples include positioning of the site of cell division and determination of cell fate during embryonic development. This positional information often is encoded in concentration gradients. A specific protein is produced only within a small region, and subsequently spreads into the surrounding space. This leads to a spatial concentration gradient, with the highest protein concentration near the source. By switching on a signal only where the local concentration is above a certain threshold, this gradient can provide positional information. However, intrinsic randomness in biochemical reactions will lead to unavoidable fluctuations in the concentration profile, which in turn will lead to fluctuations in the identified position. We therefore investigated how precisely a noisy concentration gradient can specify positional information. We found that time-averaging of concentration measurements potentially allows for great precision to be achieved even with remarkably low protein copy numbers. We applied our results to a number of examples in both cell and developmental biology, including positioning of the site of cell division in bacteria and yeast, as well as gene expression in the developing Drosophila embryo.","The ability to measure the position of a biological system depends on its ability to measure the concentration of a spatially varying range of proteins.

These include reducing social contacts by closing schools or postponing public events, and encouraging hand washing and the use of masks. These interventions will not only have a non-intuitive impact on the epidemic dynamics, but they will also have direct and indirect social and economic costs, which mean that governments will only want to use them for a limited amount of time. We use simulations to show that limited-time interventions that achieve one aim, e.g., contain the total number of cases below some maximum number of treatments available, are not the same as those that achieve another, e.g., minimize peak demand for health care services.

Here, nuclear and mtDNA data reveal genetic complexities of RVF key vectors (Aedes mcintoshi and Ae. ochraceus) partly explaining the disease outbreak pattern in Kenya. While anticipating population differentiation, we found that the hitherto known Ae. mcintoshi in fact comprises a species complex, with one unique species restricted to northeastern Kenya where outbreaks have increased in frequency with evidence for new involvement of Ae. ochraceus in RVF epidemiology. We infer a relatively recent, single “introduction” of Ae. ochraceus into Kenya with genetic links to a RVF hotspot in Senegal. Ultimately, our findings provide an understanding of how the two primary mosquito vector species impact RVF, which is critical to the potential prediction of the emergence and spread of the disease in Kenya.","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Aedes mcintoshi virus, which is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.

Cells respond to the Notch signal by changing which genes are transcribed. Most previous studies have looked at changes in gene activity at a single time point, long after the start of signaling. By looking at carefully timed intervals immediately after Notch pathway activation, we have been able to follow the dynamic changes in transcription of all the genes and have found that they exhibit different patterns of activity. For example, activity of some genes, especially a previously characterised family called the E(spl) genes, starts very early, whereas others show more delayed upregulation. Our investigations into the underlying mechanisms reveal that cross-regulatory interactions driven by the early genes are required to shape the timing of the delayed response. This feed-forward mechanism is important because it explains why the E(spl)/Hes genes can play such a pivotal role in the Notch response, despite the fact that many other genes are regulated by the signal, a finding that will be valuable for understanding the contribution of E(spl)/Hes genes in diseases associated with altered Notch.","The Notch signaling pathway is essential for the proper development of the nervous system. In the Drosophila melanogaster, the Notch pathway is activated by a short pulse of light, which results in a rapid increase in the number of genes in the genome that respond to the signal.

Many horizontally acquired genes are A+T-rich, a feature which can be important in distinguishing these loci from the host genes.

Previously, we have established that a conserved PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates immunity in C. elegans, establishing the conservation of key innate immune signaling pathways of mammals in the immune response of C. elegans. Whereas multiple proteins have been identified as potential targets of p38 MAPK in immunity, the identification of physiological substrates of p38 MAPK in mammalian organisms has been challenging. Here, using a forward genetic approach to identify downstream regulators of the C. elegans innate immune response, we have characterized the transcription factor ATF-7, a conserved member of the basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family orthologous to mammalian ATF2. We find that ATF-7 functions as a transcriptional regulator of PMK-1 MAPK–mediated innate immunity, functioning as a repressor of immune gene expression that undergoes a switch to an activator upon activation by PMK-1. Our data point to the regulation of the ATF2/ATF7/CREB5 family of transcriptional regulators by p38 MAPK as an ancient conserved mechanism for the control of innate immunity in metazoans and suggests a mechanism by which the protean effects of p38 MAPK on the mammalian innate immune response may be mediated.","Innate immunity is the ability of a cell to defend itself against a pathogen.

Induction of T and B cell memory is the basis of vaccinations and cellular immunity to intracellular pathogens depends upon the number and quality of memory CD8 T cells. Understanding the mechanisms that control various facets of CD8 T cell memory is of fundamental importance for development of effective vaccines. In this study, we have identified the transcription factor FOXO3 as a crucial regulator of the magnitude of CD8 T cell memory. During a T cell response, FOXO3 limits the number of memory CD8 T cells by inhibiting the accumulation of memory precursor effector cells that give raise to long-lived CD8 T cells. Loss of FOXO3 activity in T cells led to a durable increase in the number of memory CD8 T cells, and the functional quality of FOXO3-deficient memory CD8 T cells was unaffected by FOXO3 deficiency. Thus, our studies suggest that targeting FOXO3 activity may be a fruitful strategy to augment vaccine-induced CD8 T cell memory and protective immunity.","CD8 T cells are the master cells of the immune system and play an important role in the regulation of the immune response. The CD8 T cell response is modulated by a number of signaling pathways, including Akt, PI3K, and the PI3K/TOR signaling pathway. However, the role of these signaling pathways in CD8 T cell memory remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of FOXO3 in CD8 T cell memory in Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCMV) mice. We found that FOXO3 deficiency induced expansion of CD8 T cells, preferentially in the spleen, and T cell-specific precursor FOXO3 in LCMV mice. We also found that FOXO3 deficiency inhibited the accumulation of growth factor-deprived CD8 T cells, thereby reducing the virus viability. Our data suggest that FOXO3 deficiency is a critical regulator of CD8 T cell memory, and that FOXO3 deficiency may be a therapeutic tool to enhance the immune response against pathogens.",12.25885038038884

The fraction of parasites specialized for transmission instead of replication (transmission investment) could change with each cycle of replication in response to changing conditions within the host. Measuring how transmission investment changes through time could help us understand how malaria spreads so efficiently through populations of human and other animals. However, transmission investment is usually impossible to measure directly and instead has to be estimated by comparing the number of transmission forms with total parasite numbers in blood samples. Here we use a model to simulate data from an infection—so that the true level of transmission investment is known—and test published methods for estimation. We find that existing methods do not accurately estimate transmission investment from simulated data, and we propose a new statistical method that works substantially better. When applied to rodent malaria data, our method suggests that transmission investment can vary substantially over the course of infection, with notably different patterns of allocation across hosts.","Microparasites infect new hosts specialized life stages, requiring a subset of parasite population forgo proliferation to develop transmission forms.

This vital process relies on the dorsal migration of the two lateral ectodermal sheets and is necessary for the protective epidermis to completely envelop the embryo. The row of cells located at the front of migration, called the leading edge, is the organizing center of the process, where key signaling pathways turn on specific gene expression. Here we used a genomic approach to identify new genes whose expression is restricted to the leading edge. A quantitative analysis revealed differential expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the leading edge, which was considered for a long time as homogeneous or amorphous. We demonstrate that anterior-posterior cues provide an orthogonal coordinate system specifying cell identity along the whole leading edge, making it a highly patterned morphogenetic center. We further show that these anterior-posterior cues are functionally important, controlling the dynamics of dorsal closure and participating to the robustness of the process.

Progressive production of PrPSc through the constitutive conformational conversion of PrPC into PrPSc underlies prion propagation. However, the mechanism enabling progressive production of PrPSc in prion-infected cells remains unknown. We here found that the VPS10P sorting receptor sortilin is involved in degradation of PrPC and PrPSc in infected cells by binding to both molecules and subsequently trafficking them to the lysosomal protein degradation pathway. Interestingly, we also found that degradation of sortilin was stimulated in lysosomes in prion-infected cells possibly as a result of the sortilin-PrPC or -PrPSc complexes being trafficked to lysosomes. Our findings indicate that PrPSc itself impairs the sortilin-mediated degradation of PrPC and PrPSc by stimulating degradation of sortilin in lysosomes. This eventually results in progressive production of PrPSc in prion-infected cells by increasing the opportunity of PrPC to convert into PrPSc and by accumulating the already produced PrPSc. This mechanism was confirmed in sortilin-KO mice infected with prions. The mice had exacerbated prion disease with earlier accumulation of PrPSc in their brains.","Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormally folded prion protein, PrPSc.

Thus, better understanding of the host-pathogen interactions supporting establishment of the intracellular replicative niche is critical. In this study, we found that infection of macrophages with Brucella induces a host stress response called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a conserved stress response originating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Full induction of the UPR requires live bacteria and expression of a microtubule modulating protein, TcpB. Inhibition of the UPR with the drug tauroursodeoxycholic acid significantly diminished Brucella replication. Together these results suggest Brucella induces the UPR to enable its own replication within host macrophages.

The disease is better controlled when affected communities are included in the planning and carrying out of distribution of Ivermectin used to treat the disease. For a community to be able to prevent people from getting this disease, members must take Ivermectin once or twice a year, continuously for about 20 years. Hence, the organization in charge of controlling river blindness (African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control–APOC) decided that when a control programme is started in a community, the community must be involved and assisted to take full charge of the programme so that within 12 years the community can sustain the distribution of Ivermectin for as long as necessary. This community directed strategy prevented river blindness in many communities. However, after 10–12 years of implementation, studies found that river blindness largely persists in communities in three drainage basins in South West Region of Cameroon. This paper discussed the operational challenges that the programme may have faced in these areas.","Onchocerciasis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) are working together to reduce the burden of onchocerciasis in sub-Saharan Africa through the use of the Community-Directed Treatment Initiative (CDTI) model. The CDTI model has been shown to be effective in reducing the burden of onchocerciasis in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the impact of the CDTI model on community participation in the control of onchocerciasis is not well understood. We conducted a three-year retrospective study in the South West of Cameroon to explore the impact of the CDTI model on community participation in the control of onchocerciasis in the region. We found that community participation was weak, with 6 (15%) of Community Drug Distributors reporting selected general community meetings required, and that health service was able to meet the needs of individual communities partly due to transportation challenges and letters from the Mass Drug Administration.

The majority of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa where there is a lack of diagnostic resources and expertise, making it difficult to develop effective prevention and control strategies. In recent years, several real-time RT-PCR based diagnostic assays have been introduced to many developing countries in an effort to control the H1N1 pandemic flu, Ebola outbreak, and other tropical viral infections. In an effort to further improve rabies diagnostics, we developed a pan-lyssavirus Taqman real-time RT-PCR assay called LN34 for the detection of all known RABV variants and other lyssavirus species. The LN34 assay uses a combination of degenerate nucleotides, multiplex primers and probes, and unique probe modifications to achieve superior sensitivity and specificity compared to previously published RT-PCR based rabies diagnostics. Equally important, the LN34 assay is simple to set up, high throughput, combines multiple standard controls and can be used directly in widely available real-time RT-PCR systems. The LN34 assay was validated using a broad and comprehensive panel of highly diverse RABV variants and other lyssaviruses. A validated universal rabies diagnostic assay will be important in regions where RABV and other lyssaviruses co-circulate and for establishing a widely accepted diagnostic protocol. Over 200 clinical samples (including ante-mortem, post-mortem, and field derived samples) were tested with the LN34 assay, and the assay achieved 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in our laboratory. Over 300 published genome sequences from representatives of RABV and other lyssaviruses were found to contain the conserved LN34 primer and probe targeting sites in an in silico analysis. We are expanding the validation of the LN34 assay to multiple domestic and international laboratories and expect the LN34 assay will drastically improve rabies diagnostic capacities globally.","Rabies virus (RABV)-related lyssaviruses are deadly zoonotic diseases responsible for 70,000 estimated human deaths worldwide each year.

It is caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors, leading to destruction of insulin-secreting cells. Although significant progress has recently been made in elucidating the genetics of T1D, the non-genetic component has remained poorly defined. Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of DNA, are indispensable for genomic processes such as transcriptional regulation and are frequently perturbed in human disease. We therefore hypothesized that epigenetic variation could underlie some of the non-genetic component of T1D aetiology, and we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of a specific subset of immune cells (monocytes) from monozygotic twins discordant for T1D. This revealed the presence of T1D–specific methylation variable positions (T1D–MVPs) in the T1D–affected co-twins. Since these T1D–MVPs were found in MZ twins, they cannot be due to genetic differences. Additional experiments revealed that some of these T1D–MVPs are found in individuals before T1D diagnosis, suggesting they arise very early in the process that leads to overt T1D and are not simply due to post-disease associated factors (e.g. medication or long-term metabolic changes). T1D–MVPs may thus potentially represent a previously unappreciated, and important, component of type 1 diabetes risk.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common autoimmune disease in the world, affecting more than 100 million people worldwide.

It was recently shown to share a common ancestor with viral proteins that drive fusion of the viral envelope with host membranes, but its mechanism of action remained elusive, since the reported structure did not resolve the proposed membrane interaction surface. Here, we report two new HAP2 structures revealing that HAP2 has evolved diverse membrane interaction surfaces. In the flowering plants, HAP2 uses an amphipathic helix that presents nonpolar residues to the target membrane; in trypanosomes, the membrane interaction surface comprises three shallow nonpolar loops.","HAP2 is a gamete-expressed transmembrane protein that initiates fusion between host cells and the membrane of the host cell.

At the crux of (and critically required for) meiotic chromosome segregation is a transient association between homologous chromosomes established by a crossover recombination event. Recombination intermediates embed within a ~100 nm wide proteinaceous structure that connects aligned homologous axes, the synaptonemal complex (SC). While genetic data implicate certain SC structural proteins in crossover formation, it is unclear how such coiled-coil, rod-like proteins carry out their recombination function. Our structure-function analysis of the yeast SC transverse filament protein, Zip1, reveals pro-crossover and pro-synapsis functions that are encompassed by adjacent N terminal regions. We also discovered that the pro-crossover region of Zip1 promotes proper localization of pro-crossover factor and putative SUMO ligase, Zip3, to meiotic recombination sites. Zip3 is known to not only promote crossovers but also to influence the post-translational modification of another SC structural component, Ecm11, which is dispensable for crossovers. Our findings raise the possibility that Zip1’s N terminus acts as a liaison to connect pro-crossover factors (like Zip3) to SC assembly proteins (such as Ecm11) in order to coordinate the two landmark meiotic chromosomal processes.","Crosstalk recombination is the process by which two or more chromosomes from the same chromosome are joined together to form a single pair of chromosomes. In yeast, this process is called synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly, and it relies on the meiosis-specific MutS complex. We have previously shown that the Zip1 protein is unique in that it is required for a large subset of crossovers, and that the Zip1 N terminus is critical for crossover synapsis. Here, we show that the Zip1 N terminus is also critical for crossover synapsis. We show that deletion of Zip1 residues 21–163 abolishes the tripartite SC assembly and allows the SUMOylation of the SC central element, Ecm11, to allow excess MutS crossover recombination. We also show that deletion of Zip1 residues 15–25 abolishes the tripartite SC assembly and allows the SUMOylation of the SC central element, Ecm11, to allow excess MutS crossover recombination.",12.122439024390246

Instead of representing the original pressure waveforms, the inner ear represents how the energy in a sound is distributed across frequency bands and how the energy distribution evolves over time. The generation of cochleagrams is highly non-linear resulting in the dominance of one sound source per time-frequency bin under natural conditions (masking). Auditory cortex is believed to decompose cochleagrams into structural primitives, i.e., reappearing regular spectro-temporal subpatterns that make up cochleagram patterns (similar to edges in images). However, such a decomposition has so far only been modeled without considering masking and non-negativity. Here we apply a novel non-linear sparse coding model that can capture masking non-linearities and non-negativities. When trained on cochleagrams of natural sounds, the model gives rise to an encoding primarily based-on spectro-temporally localized components. If stimulated by a sound, the encoding units compete to explain its contents. The competition is a direct consequence of the statistical sound model, and it results in neural responses being best described by spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) with positive and negative subfields. The emerging STRFs show a higher similarity to experimentally measured STRFs than a model without masking, which provides evidence for cortical encoding being consistent with the masking based sound statistics of cochleagrams. Furthermore, and more generally, our study suggests for the first time that negative subfields of STRFs may be direct evidence for explaining away effects resulting from performing inference in an underlying statistical model.","The auditory cortex (A1) represents the structural primitives of sounds composed in the outer ear.

Here, we focused on the processing of temporal and/or spatial information in the proximal and distal parts of CA1 and CA3 in mice to test whether the two concepts are reconcilable. To do so, we used an imaging method with cellular resolution based on the detection of the RNA of the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Arc, which is tied to synaptic plasticity and memory demands, and correlated imaging results with memory performance. Our data confirm the existence of subnetworks segregated along the proximodistal axis of CA1 and CA3 that preferentially process spatial and non-spatial information and suggest a key involvement of distal CA1 in temporal information processing. In addition, they show that the two models are complementary to a large extent and posit the “segregated” model as a viable alternative for the two-streams hypothesis.","Epileptic memory involves the processing of spatial non-spatial information, which is segregated from the spatial non-spatial salient dimension of the memory task.

On average, women in the highest tertile of PFAS concentrations regained 1.7–2.2 kg more body weight than women in the lowest tertile.Higher baseline plasma concentrations of PFASs, especially perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), were significantly associated with greater decline in RMR during the first 6 months and less increase in RMR during the period when participants on average regained weight (6–24 months).In this diet-induced weight-loss trial, higher baseline PFAS concentrations were associated with a greater weight regain, especially in women, possibly explained by a slower return of RMR levels.

Here, we demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory potential of an attenuated strain of Chlamydia trachomatis, that fails to activate the inflammasome, can be rescued by the addition of a bacterial metabolite. The requirement for this metabolite, highlights a novel mechanism of inflammasome regulation and reveals a crucial role for STING mediated interferon signalling independent of cGAS.

In addition to extrinsic variability caused by environmental fluctuations, cells face intrinsic variability arising from the inherent noise of gene expression and of other molecular processes. microRNAs, which act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, are beginning to be recognized for their ability to confer robustness to biological systems by buffering the effects of noisy gene expression. Although noise often is viewed as destabilizing, some biological processes make use of noise in order to make stochastic decisions. In this paper, we describe a role for microRNAs in preventing the stochastic elimination of excess cells in the developing fly retina. After the sense organs that make up the eye have been specified, pruning of excess cells occurs through the action of the gene hid, the expression of which triggers cell death. Specific mechanisms are needed to protect specialized cells which need to be maintained to ensure that only excess cells are eliminated. We report that a pair of related microRNAs, miR-263a/b, protect sense organs during this pruning process by directly acting upon and limiting the expression of the proapoptotic gene hid. This example, illustrates a novel function for miRNAs in ensuring developmental robustness during apoptotic tissue pruning.","Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that are expressed in a wide range of cell types, including the peripheral kingdom of the animal kingdom.

These allow desirable genetic traits (such as a much reduced capacity for vectors to transmit viruses) to be spread through a target population; taking advantage of natural mate seeking behaviour to locate vector sub-populations that can be extremely difficult for humans to locate and reach. Here we use mathematical models (parameterised to consider mosquito populations) to demonstrate the robustness of the engineered underdominance and killer-rescue classes of gene drive to different ecological factors including birth and death rates; the number and quality of breeding sites (i.e. carrying capacity); and the strength of density-dependent competition during the larval development phase.

Ancient endogenous viruses, also known as paleoviruses, are relics of viral genomes or fragments thereof that once infiltrated their host's germline and then remained as molecular “fossils” within the host genome. The massive genome sequencing of recent years has unearthed vast numbers of paleoviruses from various animal genomes, including the first endogenous hepatitis B viruses (eHBVs) in bird genomes. We screened genomes of land vertebrates (amniotes) for the presence of paleoviruses and identified ancient eHBVs in the recently sequenced genomes of crocodilians, snakes, and turtles. We report an eHBV that is >207 million years old, making it the oldest endogenous virus currently known. Furthermore, our results provide direct evidence that the Hepadnaviridae virus family infected birds, crocodilians and turtles during the Mesozoic Era, and suggest a long-lasting coexistence of these viruses and their amniote hosts at least since the Early Mesozoic. We challenge previous views on the origin of the oncogenic X gene and provide an evolutionary explanation as to why only mammalian hepatitis B infection leads to hepatocellular carcinoma.","Hepadnaviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses that infect species of birds, mammals, and reptiles.

Whereas antiretroviral treatment succeeds to control viral replication, some patients fail to reconstitute their CD4+ T cell count to normal value. IL-7 is a promising cytokine under evaluation for its use in HIV infection, in supplement to antiretroviral therapy, as it increases cell proliferation and survival. Here, we use data from three clinical trials testing the effect of IL-7 on CD4+ T-cell recovery in treated HIV-infected individuals and use a simple mathematical model to quantify IL-7 effects by estimating the biological parameters of the model. We show that the increase of peripheral proliferation could not explain alone the long-term dynamics of T cells after IL-7 injections underlining other important effects such as the improvement of cell survival. We also investigate the feasibility and the efficiency of repetitions of IL-7 cycles and argue for further evaluation through clinical trials.","Exogenous Interleukin-7 (IL-7) has been shown to increase CD4+ T cell subsets in HIV-1 infected patients.

The infection triggers an acute febrile illness, the paroxysms, occurring every 48 or 72 hours depending on the species. Plasmodium vivax, in most cases, does not cause severe malaria, but it is the most geographically widespread parasite responsible for human disease and causes substantial costs to individuals and governments. Once the parasite reaches the blood stream, they infect reticulocytes that can be destroyed by phagocytes. Our goal was to assess the importance of monocyte subsets during malaria. We found that P. vivax infection causes an increase in frequency of circulating monocytes, which were defined as classical, inflammatory, and patrolling, based on the expression of membrane molecules. Classical and inflammatory monocytes produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and were distinguished from patrolling monocytes by displaying larger and more active mitochondria. Importantly, inflammatory monocytes were more efficient phagocytes; produced high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and TNF and consequently control better Plasmodium vivax infection. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that CD14+CD16+ monocytes display effector functions involved in parasite control during malaria.","Infection with Plasmodium vivax results in strong activation of monocytes, important components of the systemic inflammatory response to parasite control.

However, CNS inflammation and neurological symptoms are complications that can occur in severe cases. This outcome of disease is regularly observed in T and B cell-deficient C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice upon infection with R. typhi. We show here that CD4+ T cells are as protective as cytotoxic CD8+ T cells against R. typhi as long as they are present in time. This is evidenced by the fact that neither CD8+ nor CD4+ T cell-deficient C57BL/6 mice develop disease which is also true for R. typhi-infected C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice that receive immune CD8+ or CD4+ at an early point in time. Moreover, adoptive transfer of immune CD4+ T cells still protects approximately 60% of C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice when applied later in advanced infection when the bacteria start to rise. Although CD8+ T cells are faster and more efficient in bacterial elimination, R. typhi is not detectable in CD4+ T cell recipients anymore. We further show that immune CD4+ T cells activate bactericidal functions of microglia and macrophages in the CNS in vivo and inhibit bacterial growth in infected macrophages in vitro which is in part mediated by the release of IFNγ. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that CD4+ T cells alone are sufficient to protect against R. typhi infection. With regard to vaccination our findings suggest that the induction of R. typhi-specific CD4+ TH1 effector T cells may be as effective as the much more difficult targeting of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.","Rickettsia typhi intracellular bacterium causes endemic typhus, febrile disease fatal complications including pneumonia and hepatitis meningoencephalitis, and regular T B cell-deficient C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice Rickettsia typhi infection.

We used an O1-specific bacteriophage as a tool to understand if, and how, V. cholerae can alter O1 antigen expression. We discovered that two genes, which are critical for O1 antigen biosynthesis, are subject to phase variation. Additionally, one of the phase variable genes we identified was not previously known to play a role in O1 antigen biosynthesis in V. cholerae. Phase variation is a well-recognized mechanism many other bacterial pathogens use to generate variable expression of surface components, and this is generally thought to help these organisms evade the immune system.

Gram-positive bacteria secrete oligopeptide quorum-sensing signals that bind to membrane-bound and cytosolic receptors. How oligopeptide quorum-sensing signals regulate the activity of their target receptors was previously largely unknown. Here we show that proteins belonging to the family of bacterial quorum-sensing receptors known as the Rap phosphatases undergo a remarkable regulatory conformational change upon binding oligopeptide signals. More specifically, in the absence of the oligopeptide signal, Rap proteins consist of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain consisting of a three-helix bundle, and a superhelical C-terminal domain comprising an array of seven similar helix-turn-helix repeats. A flexible helix-containing linker region connects these domains. In complex with the regulatory oligopeptide, however, the Rap protein domains and linker region rearrange, merging to form a single continuous superhelical structure consisting of nine helix-turn-helix repeats. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of conformational change-induced repeat domain expansion. The structure-function studies presented here set the stage for the rational development of antimicrobial peptides and peptide-mimetics capable of targeting cell–cell signaling mediated by Rap proteins and similar bacterial receptors.","Gram-positive quorum-sensing receptors (RNPPs) are proteins that regulate the import of oligo autoinducers into the host cell.

As a consequence, viral genomes become valuable resources to reconstruct the spatial and temporal processes that are shaping epidemic or endemic dynamics. In molecular epidemiology, spatial inference is often limited to the interpretation of evolutionary histories with respect to the sampling locations of the pathogens. To test hypotheses about the spatial diffusion patterns of viruses, analytical techniques are required that enable us to reconstruct how viruses migrated in the past. Here, we develop a model to infer diffusion processes among discrete locations in timed evolutionary histories in a statistically efficient fashion. Applications to Avian Influenza A H5N1 and Rabies virus in Central and West African dogs demonstrate several advantages of simultaneously inferring spatial and temporal processes from gene sequences.","Infectious disease is a major public health problem in many parts of the world. The spread of viruses is a key factor in epidemic dynamics, and the geographical distribution of viruses frequently interpreted as light genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal patterns of viruses mainly restricted to model-free heuristic approaches provide little insight into temporal setting spatial dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference of historical dispersal patterns of viruses. We use this framework to test the hypothesis that the diffusion of viruses is a key factor in the spread of infectious diseases.

Sex chromosomes have a sex-biased transmission, a pattern which might create favourable conditions for the spread of sexually antagonistic alleles (i.e. alleles beneficial for one sex but deleterious for the other). Yet, expectations for genetic systems with unusual inheritance of sex chromosomes may differ from those derived from standard systems (e.g. XY). Here we demonstrate theoretically that in organisms such as aphids, which alternate sexual and asexual reproduction and display an unusual inheritance of the X chromosome, male-beneficial sexually antagonistic alleles accumulate preferentially on that chromosome, while asexual female-beneficial alleles accumulate on autosomes. Theoretical models suggest that the evolution of sex-biased gene expression may solve such sexual conflicts, by restricting the product of a sexually antagonistic allele to the sex it benefits. We show that in the pea aphid, the genomic location (X versus autosomes) of genes with a sex-biased expression fits predictions derived from this hypothesis. On top of reporting a strong masculinization of the aphid X chromosome, our study highlights the relevance of organisms with an alternative mode of sex chromosome inheritance to understanding the evolutionary forces shaping chromosome evolution.",Sex chromosomes have evolved in a variety of ways over the last century.

The importance of chromatin remodelers in inducing structural changes to chromatin and, therefore, in controlling the expression of genes has recently resurfaced with the realization that several of them are mutated in human cancers. SNF5, which serves as the core subunit of the BAF remodeling complex, is one such remodeler. In this study, we identify the role of SNF5 induced chromatin remodeling in cell differentiation, the commitment of embryonic cells to a mature lineage-committed state. Importantly, we find that SNF5 establishes appropriate chromatin remodeling patterns during differentiation by controlling the levels of the OCT4 protein, the master determinant of the undifferentiated state. On receipt of differentiation cues, SNF5 opens the chromatin of repressed genes that are occupied by OCT4. SNF5 also induces the closing of genes that are being actively transcribed and OCT4 bound. Further, we show that SNF5 is necessary for cell survival during differentiation, highlighting its crucial role in the process. Together, our data shed novel insights on the importance of SNF5 in maintaining the balance between the embryonic and differentiated states.",Nucleosome occupancy controls the accessibility of transcription machinery in DNA regulatory regions.

We measured susceptibility to infection and transmission for Florida Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes for two emergent strains of chikungunya virus (Indian Ocean and Asian strains). Both mosquito species showed high susceptibility to infection and rapid spread of the virus throughout the body of the mosquito, including the saliva for both emergent strains of chikungunya virus.

In support of this, we recently showed that chronic intestinal nematode infection resulted in reduced immune responses and higher mycobacterial burden at distal sites. How a gut-dwelling nematode modulate immune responses in skin-draining lymph nodes (LN) was not clear. We found a reduced expansion of LN draining the BCG injected footpad in worm-infected animals, but no evidence for a spread of regulatory cells or cytokines to the BCG-draining LN. Interestingly, we found that mice chronically infected with intestinal worms had significantly smaller skin-draining LN. We propose that the expansion of mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) occur at the cost of other LN, leading to atrophy of skin-draining LN. Expansion of the lymphocyte pool by IL-7, allowed worm-infected animals to maintain larger skin-draining LN while the mLN did not further expand. De-worming treatment of mice eventually restored the cellularity of skin-draining LN. This, however, took time indicating that effect of worms persisted long after the infection cleared. By de-worming and allowing time for the LN to recover, the cellular responses to BCG injection in the footpad were restored in the draining popliteal LN. Thus, paucity of lymphocytes at peripheral sites can explain impaired peripheral immune responses in worm-infected animals.","Intestinal nematodes are known to suppress immune responses in the context of allergy, gut inflammation, and secondary infection vaccination.

This increase correlates with a significant augment in the activity of HMGCoA reductase (the limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis), favoring a cholesterol-enriched cellular environment. The augment in the activity of the HMGCR observed in infected cells is caused by a decrease in the phosphorylation level of the HMGCR, associated with the inactivation of AMPK. In agreement, AMPK activation by metformin reduces HMGCR activity and affects viral replication. The role HMGCR and AMPK activity in DENV replicative complexes formation was confirmed by the co-localization of HMGCR and cholesterol with the viral proteins NS3, NS4A and E. Furthermore, metformin and lovastatin (HMGCR inhibitor) treatments altered this co-localization as well as replicative complexes formation supporting that active HMGCR is required for replicative complexes formation. The results show that during DENV infection, an increase in the HMGCR activity occurs through AMPK inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol levels in endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation. This work provides new information about the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during DENV replicative cycle and identifies potential new antiviral targets for DENV replication.","Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes dengue fever in humans.

High DEK expression causes cancer related phenotypes such as increased cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Despite the well documented link between high DEK expression and cancer, the consequences of Dek overexpression in vivo are poorly understood. To determine if Dek contributes to carcinogenesis in vivo, we generated a Dek inducible transgenic mouse model wherein Dek can be overexpressed in specific tissues and inhibited with the drug doxycycline. We targeted Dek overexpression to keratinocytes, the cell of origin for squamous cell carcinoma, and exposed the mice to the chemical carcinogen 4NQO to induce oral cavity and esophageal carcinogenesis. We found that DEK overexpression was sufficient to increase gross esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence and caused a trend toward increased cellular proliferation in adjacent non-tumor tissue.

Accessory functions could serve as an arsenal enabling prokaryotes to develop adaptations to new niches. Therefore, prokaryotic core and accessory components are analogous to the operating system and applications (apps) of smartphones. However, it is puzzling how these accessory functions are linked with the core regulatory network in prokaryotes during niche adaptations. Here we address this question by investigating the adaptive regulation of hierarchical core/accessory subsets in the multipartite pangenome (chromosome, chromid and plasmid) of Sinorhizobium fredii, which is a facultative microsymbiont of soybeans. The level and variation of gene expression, and gene connectivity revealed in transcriptomes under free-living and symbiotic conditions are positively correlated with the gene conservation level, i.e. from strain-specific accessory genes to genus core. Replicon-dependent organization and adaptive regulation of hierarchical core/accessory subsets suggest distinct roles of different replicons not only in environmental adaptation but also intra- and inter-species differentiation. Among core and accessory genes with host-specific upregulation patterns, we experimentally identified novel symbiotic players involved in host-specific adaptation.","The multipartite pan (composed of genes chromosome, chromids, and accessory genes) is an important region of the prokaryotic genome.

We found that the accessory genes are enriched in the chromid region of the pan, and that the gene connectivity within the chromid region is strongly correlated with the gene conservation level of the core transcriptome. We also found that the gene connectivity within the chromid region is strongly correlated with the gene conservation level of the core transcriptome.

The mechanisms the virus uses to evade these responses are not clear. Recently we identified a gene encoded by EBV, BNLF2a, that when expressed ectopically in cells inhibited their recognition by CD8+ T cells. To determine the contribution of BNLF2a to evasion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cell recognition and whether EBV encoded additional immune evasion mechanisms, a recombinant EBV was constructed in which BNLF2a was deleted. We found that cells infected with the recombinant virus were better recognized by CD8+ T cells specific for targets expressed co-incidently with BNLF2a, compared to cells infected with a non-recombinant virus. However, proteins expressed at late stages of the viral infection cycle were poorly recognised by CD8+ T cells, suggesting EBV encodes additional immune evasion genes to prevent effective CD8+ T cell recognition. This study highlights the stage-specific nature of viral immune evasion mechanisms.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma- herpesvirus that persists in life in infected individuals despite presence of a strong immune response. lytic cycle EBV viral proteins expressed in the early phase of replication are potentially allowing virally infected cells to recognize eliminated CD8 + T cells. Recently identified immune evasion protein encoded by EBV, BNLF2a, is expressed in the early phase of lytic replication and inhibits peptide-ATP-binding functions transporter associated with antigen processing. Here, we show that BNLF2a causes decreased surface MHC class expression in EBV-transformed B cell lines and inhibits presentation of indicator antigens to CD8 + T cells. In contrast, BNLF2a-deleted recombinant EBV (BNLF2a) is able to present antigen-specific EBV-encoded proteins to B cell lines, but not to CD8 + T cells. We also show that BNLF2a-mediated expression of BNLF2a-deleted recombinant EBV (BNLF2a) is downregulated in EBV-transformed B cell lines compared to wild-type EBV (BNLF2a), and that BNLF2a-mediated expression of BNLF2a-deleted wild-type EBV (BNLF2a) is downregulated in EBV-transformed B cell lines compared to wild-type EBV (BNLF2a). Our data suggest that BNLF2a-mediated expression of BNLF2a-deleted recombinant EBV (BNLF2a) is downregulated in EBV-transformed B cell lines compared to wild-type EBV (BNLF2a), and that BNLF2a-mediated expression of BNLF2a-deleted wild-type EBV (BNLF2a) is downregulated in EBV-transformed B cell lines compared to wild-type EBV (BNLF2a).",15.000267131242747

Such expansion of a family of pathways requires two main evolutionary processes—acquisition of additional copies of the pathway's genes and divergence of interaction specificity to prevent cross-talk between pathways while preserving interactions within each copy of the pathway. In bacteria, acquisition can occur horizontally, by transfer between different lineages, or vertically, by duplication within the lineage. Interaction specificity is thought to diverge through a promiscuous intermediate component that prevents loss of interaction during the process. In this work, we study the mechanisms underlying the extreme expansion of the Rap-Phr cell–cell signaling family in the Bacillus genus. Specificity of Rap-Phr interaction is critical for guiding preferential action towards kin. We find that horizontal transfer and not duplication guides the acquisition of an already divergent Rap-Phr variant. Surprisingly, duplication still has a key role during expansion, as duplication and subsequent divergence of the signaling molecule gene provide the promiscuous intermediate state needed for divergence of specificity. We therefore identify two complementary roles for horizontal and vertical processes in the evolution of social bacterial pathways.","The expansion of signaling pathways requires the acquisition of novel pathways that are not present in existing signaling families. In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the Rap-Phr cell-to-cell signaling system has undergone a massive expansion.

Both naturally selected metal hypertolerance and extraordinary leaf metal accumulation of the extremophile Arabidopsis halleri require strongly enhanced transcript levels of Heavy Metal ATPase4 (HMA4) encoding a PIB-type ATPase that pumps Zn2+ and Cd2+ out of specific cells. By comparison to the metal-sensitive A. thaliana, highly elevated HMA4 expression results from a combination of gene copy number expansion and cis-regulatory modifications. But how do these findings, which were based on a single accession, relate to species-wide HMA4 sequence diversity in A. halleri? Addressing this question, we detect positive selection in the promoter regions of three tandem A. halleri HMA4 paralogs, which are uniformly cis-activated. The accompanying hard selective sweep, however, is segmentally eclipsed as a consequence of recurrent ectopic gene conversion among HMA4 protein-coding sequences, which undergo concerted evolution. Together, this constitutes an unexpectedly complex profile of polymorphism as a result of natural selection.

We have asked the question how these parasites actually manage to swim and manoeuver in an environment that is so amazingly crowded by blood cells and that reveals rapidly varying fluid flow speeds that are 50–20.000 times faster than the trypanosome's swimming speed. Our experiments suggest an astute mechanism by which trypanosomes have perfectly adapted to their hostile microenvironment. We found that the pathogens can readily adjust the beating direction of their single flagellum in response to purely mechanical cues. In the blood they exploit the spacing and shape of blood cells for very efficient forward movement that is required for host antibody clearance. When the parasites get trapped, i.e. in the extracellular matrix, they reverse the beating direction and consequently move backwards. The mechanism of flagellar beat switch is unique in nature and represents a genetically fixed trypanosome virulence factor. By introducing innovative technological advances, we have been able to quantify this complex cell behavior with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. These include the first numerical simulation of a cell of this complexity, extending the protozoans suitability as a model organism for the regulation of flagellar and ciliary motility.","African trypanosomes are the most common pathogens in vertebrate blood. They live in the dense packaging of blood cells, which are constantly flowing at high velocities. In order to evade the immune response, trypanosomes swim in the blood. In this study, we used high-speed fluorescence microscopy to investigate the mode dynamics of trypanosomes swimming in the blood. We found that trypanosomes pull forward on the beat of a single flagellum, which is perpendicular to the cell body, and that the presence of particles in the cell body translates into asymmetrically shaped cell body. The presence of particles in the cell body increases the density of the obstacles, and the parasites reverse the flagellar beat in order to avoid getting trapped. In addition, the flagellar beat reversal occurs randomly, resulting in irregular waveforms in the apparent cell tumbling. Our simulation technique produces a rotating cell body helical swimming path, providing a functioning simulation method for microorganism complex swimming strategy.",11.956107142857146

However, despite many clues, we understand little about how memory storage and retrieval is implemented in neural circuits. In particular, while many previous studies considered the amount of information that can be stored in synaptic connections under biological constraints on the dynamic range of synapses, how much of this information can be successfully recovered by neural dynamics during memory retrieval remains unclear. Here, we use a top-down approach to address this question: we assume memories are laid down in bounded synapses by biologically relevant plasticity rules and then derive from first principles how the neural circuit should behave during recall in order to retrieve these memories most efficiently. We show that the resulting recall dynamics are consistent with a wide variety of properties of hippocampal area CA3, across a range of biophysical levels – from synapses, through neurons, to circuits. Furthermore, our approach allows us to make novel and experimentally testable predictions about the link between the structure, dynamics, and function of CA3 circuitry.","The hippocampus is one of the most important regions of the brain for learning and memory.

Identifying c-MYC target genes is one of the key steps to understand both the biological role and molecular mechanism of c-MYC action. Defining the complete list of c-MYC target genes and categorizing them as genes that are directly and indirectly modulated remains a challenge. Computational models also help us to understand the mechanisms modulating c-MYC function. We describe a method to predict where MYC will bind in the genome and which c-MYC binding sites will be biologically active. The method integrates multiple sources of data, including both genome sequence and functional annotations, to predict that 460 genes are direct c-MYC targets. These include many genes previously known to be c-MYC targets as well as 245 novel direct c-MYC targets. Using multiple, independent gene-expression datasets improves the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction and demonstrates significant tissue-specific variation in c-MYC action at different genes.

The selection process entails a decision about which object is favoured by the available evidence over time. This period of time is typically in the range of hundreds of milliseconds and is widely believed to be crucial for decisions, allowing neurons to filter noise in the evidence. Despite the widespread belief that time plays this role in decisions and the growing recognition that the brain estimates elapsed time during perceptual tasks, few studies have considered how the encoding of time effects decision making. We propose that neurons encode time in this range by the same general mechanisms used to select objects for detailed processing, and that these temporal representations determine how long evidence is filtered. To this end, we simulate a perceptual decision by coupling two instances of a neural network widely used to simulate localized regions of the cerebral cortex. One network encodes the passage of time and the other makes decisions based on noisy evidence. The former influences the performance of the latter, reproducing signature characteristics of temporal estimates and perceptual decisions.","Temporal coding is the process of encoding time in a spatio-temporal manner. This process is known as trade-speed accuracy (SAT), and it has been proposed that it determines the rate of spatial evidence integrated into the rate of spatial evidence. However, the rate of spatial evidence integrated into the rate of trade-speed accuracy depends on the rate of spatial evidence integrated into the rate of gain modulation. In this paper, we propose a generic local-circuit model that encodes time ‘climbing’ activity in the cortex. We use this model to simulate a perceptual decision task, and show that the local-circuit model can produce new interval estimates. We also show that the local-circuit model can produce new signature characteristics for the decision times of experimental subjects.

Yet, a much larger group– 2 billion people–harbors latent TB infection (LTBI) without clinical symptoms, but at lifelong risk of reactivation. The physiological niches of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persistence remain incompletely defined and both pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites have been proposed. Adipose tissue constitutes 15–25% of total body mass and is an active production site for hormones and inflammatory mediators. The increasing prevalence of obesity, has led to greater incidence of type 2 diabetes. These patients suffer from three times higher risk of developing TB, pointing to a potential link between adipose tissue and TB pathogenesis. In individuals with LTBI, Mtb survives in a stressed, non-replicating state with low metabolic activity and resting macrophages serve as preferred habitat and become effectors after appropriate stimulation. Here we demonstrate that Mtb can infect and persist within adipocytes where it upregulates stress-related genes. In vivo, relative proportions of leukocyte subsets infiltrating adipose tissue varied under different conditions of infection. During natural aerosol Mtb infection, distinct leukocyte subsets, including mononuclear phagocytes, Mtb-specific CD8+ T cells and NK cells infiltrated adipose tissue and became activated.

However, most of these studies are cross-sectional and lack a mechanistic understanding of this ecosystem's structure and its response to external perturbations, therefore not allowing accurate temporal predictions. In this article, we develop a method to analyze temporal community data accounting also for time-dependent external perturbations. In particular, this method combines the classical Lotka–Volterra model of population dynamics with regression techniques to obtain mechanistically descriptive coefficients which can be further used to construct predictive models of ecosystem dynamics. Using then data from a mouse experiment under antibiotic perturbations, we are able to predict and recover the microbiota temporal dynamics and study the concept of alternative stable states and antibiotic-induced transitions. As a result, our method reveals a group of commensal microbes that potentially protect against infection by the pathogen Clostridium difficile and proposes a possible mechanism how the antibiotic makes the host more susceptible to infection.","Understanding the intestinal microbiota is crucial for human health.

The first step in the transmission process consists of the mosquitoes seeking and finding a host. Mosquitoes use the wind direction and odors, such as carbon dioxide, emitted by the hosts in order to locate a host to bite. We present a spatial computational model of the host-seeking process in a region where hosts are heterogeneously distributed in clusters. The model is used to analyze the success in finding hosts once the mosquitoes are close to the host. We show that the number of mosquito-host contacts increases as hosts become more widely spaced within their clusters; that mosquito flight perpendicular to the wind leads to greater success in locating a host; and that the number of bites per host decreases when hosts aggregate into larger clusters.","Mosquitoes transmit a wide range of diseases, including dengue fever, malaria, chikungunya, West Nile virus, and chikungunya. Mosquito host-seeking behavior is important for predicting transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne infections.

The model includes odor plumes generated spatially distributed hosts, wind velocity, and mosquito behavior based on prevailing wind odor plume. We compare different models of chemotaxis capable of producing comparable results given appropriate parameter choices. We assess the impact of changing level of host aggregation on mosquito host-seeking success near the end of host-seeking flight. clusters of hosts tightly associated with smaller patches and odor plume narrower biting rate host decreased, indicative of attack and abatement effect of host aggregation.",13.539616490891664

In the process, it increases genetic diversity through recombination of homologous chromosomes from the parents. Genetic diversity constitutes an evolutionary advantage. Prior to finding their unique pairing partner (homolog), chromosomes associate non-homologously with other chromosomes through their centromeres, a process termed centromere coupling. Little is known about the nature and mechanism of centromere coupling. In this study, we present the first pairwise characterization of this process conserved amongst eukaryotes, using the budding yeast as a model. We quantitatively analyzed the interactions between centromeres for each pair of chromosomes. We observed an interaction pattern based on chromosome size, where centromeres from smaller chromosomes frequently associated with those from other small chromosomes, and a similar association for large chromosomes. This pattern appears ubiquitous, since recombination-defective diploid cells, haploid cells forced to undergo meiosis, and wild-type yeast early in meiosis, until homologous chromosomes become paired, all undergo non-homologous centromere coupling. Centromeres derived from a common ancestor, prior to genome duplication, do not associate more often, excluding ancestral homology as the mechanism. Data from mutants affecting the meiotic bouquet, where all chromosome ends become embedded and clustered in the nuclear envelope prior to coupling, suggest a potential mechanism to generate interactions. Deciphering the mechanisms for proper pairing of homologous chromosomes helps us to understand and prevent chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancy.","Early in the meiosis process, chromosomes associate with non-pairs, tethered to centromeres. This phenomenon, conserved in higher eukaryotes, is termed centromere coupling. In budding yeast, centromere coupling is initiated by the presence of the synaptonemal complex (SC) protein Zip1. The SC protein Zip1 is required for the initiation of centromere coupling. Here, we show that the SC protein Zip1 is required for the initiation of centromere coupling in budding yeast.

Most small molecules can interact with other macromolecules in the cell ‘nonspecifically,’ i.e., with significantly lower affinity. The extent to which these nonspecific interactions influence the availability and action of the drug for its specific target depends upon the relative concentrations of drug, the specific target, and nonspecific targets. The structure of the cell is quite crowded with a highly non-uniform distribution of macromolecules that can interact with the drug of interest both specifically and nonspecifically. Thus, some compartments or micro-domains within the cell may have a comparatively high concentration of nonspecific targets, sufficient to trap the drug and retard its diffusion toward the specific target. Here, using small-molecule binding to DNA and single cell monitoring, we demonstrate that this effect results in apparently anomalous small molecule-DNA binding kinetics in cells at rates that are 1000-fold slower than in a homogeneous, dilute, aqueous environment. This slow intracellular diffusion, however, has an advantageous consequence: it leads to virtually irreversible binding of the small molecule (drug) to specific DNA targets in cells. We study and quantify the effect of nonspecific interactions between small DNA-binding molecules, including known DNA-binding drugs, in different cellular compartments in order to identify factors that account for the variability in binding kinetics among individual cells.","Non-specific drug-target interactions in the microenvironment of cells are rarely considered to be formally assessed.

Understanding the functional roles, evolution, and population dynamics of TEs is essential to understanding genome evolution and function. Much of our knowledge about TE population dynamics and evolution comes from the studies of TEs in Drosophila. However, the adaptive importance of TEs in the Drosophila genome has never been assessed. In this work, we describe the first comprehensive genome-wide screen for recent adaptive TE insertions in D. melanogaster. Using several independent criteria, we identified a set of 13 adaptive TEs and estimate that 25–50 TEs have played adaptive roles since the migration of D. melanogaster out of Africa. We show that most of these adaptive TEs are likely to be involved in regulatory changes and appear to be involved in adaptation to the temperate climate.

They infect over 200 million people in more than 70 countries and cause severe and chronic disability. Snails naturally vary in resistance to this parasite even within species, so bolstering snail resistance in the wild would block transmission. We artificially selected snails for resistance and observed a rapid evolutionary response, with the greatest change occurring in the same genomic region in two independent trials. We subsequently confirmed that the selected haplotype conveys resistance to infection by schistosomes. The extraordinarily high sequence divergence among haplotypes in this region appears to be elevated due to ongoing natural selection, likely via host-parasite co-evolution. We observed the highest variation in genes encoding putative parasite recognition proteins, suggesting that these control the resistance phenotype in a manner reminiscent of immune gene complexes in other taxa. Thus, this gene cluster presents a potential new target to interfere with parasite transmission at the vector stage.","Schistosomiasis is a neglected global pandemic that is curtailed by blocking transmission of the parasite intermediate hosts, aquatic snails.

Using two cell lines that over expressed the wild type or a mutant form of LdASS, we demonstrated that LdASS has argininosuccinate synthase activity, which is absent in the mutant form containing the G128S point mutation. Infection of mice with the cell line over expressing a mutant LdASS had a negative dominant effect as indicated by the reduction in parasite load.

TeXP accounts and removes the effects of pervasive transcription when quantifying LINE activity. Our method uses the broad distribution of LINEs to estimate the effects of pervasive transcription. Using TeXP, we processed thousands of transcriptome datasets to uniformly, and unbiasedly measure LINE-1 activity across healthy somatic cells. By removing the pervasive transcription component, we find that (1) LINE-1 is broadly expressed in healthy somatic tissues; (2) Adult brain show small levels of LINE transcription and; (3) LINE-1 transcription level is correlated with tissue cell turnover.

Obesity is defined as having a body mass index of over 30 in adults or over the 95th centile in children. Both of these conditions are major public health concerns in Western countries. Genetic studies have shown that small missing pieces of chromosome (deletions, which remove many genes) and changes to the lettering of genes (which stop the gene from working, mutations) can cause intellectual disability or obesity. Here we identified 9 children with intellectual disability and obesity who have mutations in a gene called MYT1L. This gene is thought to give an important instruction for brain development. To find out what the effect of loss of MYT1L is on brain development we reduced the levels of MYT1L (using a special chemical) in an experimental zebrafish. This showed that loss of MYT1L in zebrafish causes a problem with the development of the hypothalamus, which may explain how MYT1L mutations cause obesity in humans. In the zebrafish there was also reduction of a brain hormone called oxytocin which is involved in thought processes, which may explain why MYT1L mutations cause intellectual disability. We have identified a new genetic condition caused by MYT1L mutations, further study of this gene will help us understand, and treat, intellectual disability and obesity.","Human obesity is associated with intellectual disability and obesity-related obesity.

To increase the power of the tests for high dimensional association analysis of multiple phenotypes with next-generation sequencing data, a key issue is to develop novel statistics that can effectively extract informative internal representation and features from high dimensional data. However, the current paradigm of association analysis of multiple phenotypes does not efficiently utilize the rich correlation structure of the genotype and phenotype data. To shift the paradigm of association analysis from shallow multivariate analysis to comprehensive functional analysis, we proposed a new general statistical framework referred to as a quadratically regularized functional canonical correlation analysis (QRFCCA) for association test which explores rich correlation information in the genotype and phenotype data. Large-scale simulations demonstrate that the QRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the many existing statistics while retaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate the new approach, the QRFCCA are also applied to the TwinsUK study with 46 traits and sequencing data.

In cyanobacteria, almost all the genes are rhythmically expressed with the same ∼24 h period yet exhibit a variety of phase relationships and waveforms. Remarkably, the core pacemaker ticks robustly via simple biochemical reactions carried out by three Kai proteins: KaiC undergoes circadian phosphorylation in the presence of KaiA, KaiB and ATP. In this work, we propose a reaction network modeling the Kai oscillator based on the differentiation of dual phosphorylation sites. We found a dynamic diversity in KaiC phosphorylation which may serve as a potential regulatory mechanism related to the diverse-phased genome-wide expressions in cyanobacteria. In addition, we deduce that each KaiC hexamer is a single oscillator in regulating its own phosphorylation and interactions with KaiA or/and KaiB. In complex organisms, a number of key clock components possess similar activities (e.g., phosphorylation) with multiple nonequivalent active sites, and they may also show some unusual dynamic features that are embedded in the proteins' own reaction networks.

Genotype diversity, defined as the number of unique genotypes, and the interaction between genotypes, can strongly influence virulence and pathogen transmission. Understanding how genotypic diversity affects transmission of pathogens that naturally cycle among disparate hosts, such as vector-borne pathogens, is especially important as the capacity of the host and vector to sustain genotypic diversity may differ. To address this, we exposed Dermacentor andersoni ticks, via infected mice, to variably diverse populations of Francisella novicida genotypes. Interestingly, we found that ticks served as greater ecological filters for genotypic diversity compared to mice. This loss in genotypic diversity was due to both stochastic and selective forces. Based on these data and a model, we determined that high numbers of ticks in an environment support high genotypic diversity, while genotypic diversity will be lost rapidly in environments with low tick numbers. Together, these results provide evidence that vector population dynamics, vector-to-host ratios, and competition among pathogen genotypes play critical roles in the maintenance of pathogen genotypic diversity.","The genetic diversity of pathogens is strongly influenced by interactions between genotypes.

Twin studies have demonstrated that inheritance plays a significant role in PCOS, and recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated 11 susceptibility regions. The mechanism by which these genetic loci cause PCOS has yet to be determined. We looked at DNA methylation and gene expression levels in these 11 loci in fat biopsies from women with and without PCOS. We identified differences in the expression of two receptors that bind hormones known to contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS–the receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin. We found increased expression of the LH receptor in non-obese PCOS women, while in the obese women with PCOS the insulin receptor was underexpressed. Both excess LH stimulation and elevated insulin levels, due to decreased receptor levels and resulting insulin resistance, can cause increased androgen production from the ovary. Our findings suggest the primary mechanism for elevated androgen levels in PCOS may differ between non-obese and obese women with PCOS and that the clinical heterogeneity seen in PCOS may have genetic underpinnings.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in young women characterized by androgen excess oligomenorrhea.

African trypanosomiasis is present in Sub-Saharan Africa and transmitted by infected tsetse flies. This devastating disease is lethal if untreated, making it important to understand and characterise the basic biology of the pathogen. During the T. brucei cell cycle, organelle positioning and segregation show a high degree of coordination and control. As such, T. brucei is a highly polarised cell with the transition zone of the flagellum present inside an invagination of the pellicular membrane called the flagellar pocket (FP). The FP is the main site of traffic into and out of the cell. At the exit point of the flagellum is a cytoskeletal structure called the flagellar pocket collar (FPC). One component of the FPC, BILBO1, has been characterised as essential for the FP biogenesis and cell survival. Here, we identify a new partner of BILBO1 called FPC4, and determine the domains involved in the BILBO1-FPC4 interaction.

One kind of reproductive isolation, the sterility and inviability of species hybrids, is characterized by two of the strongest rules in evolutionary biology. The first is Haldane's rule: for species crosses in which just one hybrid sex is sterile or inviable, it tends to be the sex defined by having a pair of dissimilar sex chromosomes (e.g., the “XY” of males in humans). The second rule is the large X effect: the X chromosome has a disproportionately large effect on hybrid fitness. We dissected the genetic causes of these two rules of speciation by replacing many small chromosomal segments of the fruit fly Drosophila sechellia with those of a closely related species, D. mauritiana. Together, these segments cover 70% of the genome. We found that virtually all segments causing hybrid sterility or inviability act recessively and that hybrid male sterility is by far the most common type of hybrid incompatibility, confirming two leading theories about the causes of Haldane's rule. We also found that X-linked segments are more likely to cause hybrid male sterility than similarly sized autosomal segments.

In the first step, an intermediate thioredoxin-protein complex is formed, which is broken in the second step, releasing the substrate protein in its reduced state. In other words, the disulfide is being transferred from the substrate protein to thioredoxin, or the electrons coming from thioredoxin are shuttled to the protein substrate. The exact reaction mechanism, i.e., the detailed succession of steps in which the reaction takes place, of how this mixed disulfide is broken is not known and has been debated over the last twenty years.

Recent studies indicate a role for MITF, a master regulator of melanocyte development and biogenesis, in melanoma progression. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor ATF2 negatively regulates MITF transcription in melanocytes and in about 50% of melanoma cell lines. Increased MITF expression, seen upon inhibition of ATF2, effectively attenuated the ability of BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes to exhibit a transformed phenotype, an effect partially rescued when MITF expression was also blocked. Significantly, the development of melanoma in mice carrying genetic changes seen in human tumors was inhibited upon inactivation of ATF2 in melanocytes. Melanocytes from mice lacking active ATF2 expressed increased levels of MITF, confirming that ATF2 negatively regulates MITF and implicating this newly discovered regulatory link in melanoma development. Primary melanoma specimens that exhibit a high nuclear ATF2-to-MITF ratio were found to be associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis, further substantiating the significance of MITF control by ATF2. In all, these findings provide genetic evidence for the role of ATF2 in melanoma development and indicate an ATF2 function in fine-tuning MITF expression, which is central to understanding MITF control at the early phases of melanocyte transformation.","Melanoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is associated with poor prognosis.

In this study, we identified a critical role for Yes-associated protein (YAP) in Hippo signaling, the major effector of Hippo signaling, maintaining younger state human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and ameliorating osteoarthritis in mice. We found that YAP is co-opted by TEA domain factor (TEAD) to activate expression of forkhead box D1 ( FOXD1), a geroprotective protein, and that YAP deficiency led to overexpression of FOXD1 in osteoarthritis mice. Overexpression of YAP FOXD1 led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of YAP FOXD1 led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, which in turn, overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD), which in turn, overexpression of TEAD1), led to overexpression of TEA domain factor (TEAD1).",36.071063829787235

This interaction modulates several aspects of the viral cycle, including viral attachment, which in most cases depends on the host glycobiology dictated by the secretor and Lewis genotypes. The capacity to synthesize secretory type-I antigen H (fucose-α1,2-galactose-β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine; H1) at the mucosae, dictated by the presence of one or two functional copies of the fucosyl-transferase FUT2 gene (secretor status), has been clearly linked to infectivity in important enteric viruses such as the noroviruses. However, a big controversy existed about the contribution of H1 antigen to infection in the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in young children (rotavirus). It has not been until recently that epidemiological data evidenced a diminished incidence of rotavirus in non-secretor individuals unable to produce H1. In the present manuscript we offer the evidence that P[8] RV bind H1 via a binding site common for the P[II] RV genogroup and that the H1 precursor lacto-N-biose (galactose-β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine; LNB) is also bound to this pocket with diminished affinity. The P[8] VP8* structures show a marginal role for the L-fucose moiety from H1 in protein interaction. However, its presence provides conformational changes in the LNB moiety that increase the affinity of VP8* for the H1 ligand and would account for a stronger RV binding to mucosa in individuals expressing H1 (secretors). We thus offer a mechanistic explanation for the different incidence of P[8] RV infection in different secretor phenotypes.","Rotavirus is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in young children, accounting for 80% of human cases.

To assess its validity in olfaction, we examine the pheromone communication of moths, in which males locate their female mates by the pheromone they release. We determine the characteristics of the pheromone plume which are best detected by the male reception system. We show that they are in agreement with plume measurements in the field, so providing quantitative evidence that this system also obeys the efficient coding principle. Exploring the quantitative relationship between the properties of biological sensory systems and their natural environment should lead not only to a better understanding of neural functions and evolutionary processes, but also to improvements in the design of artificial sensory systems.","The ability of sensory neurons to detect and respond to natural stimuli is an important aspect of the development of the human brain.

Schistosomiasis can be controlled using three key approaches which include improved sanitation, health education and mass treatment with praziquantel. Additional interventions for infection prevention include: promotion of hygiene, access to safe water, and sanitation improvement and environmental management. However, the success of control initiatives involving the community depend on the level of the communities' uptake of the program, which is hinged upon understanding the community knowledge and practices towards the disease. This study therefore collected information from the community to assess level of awareness of schistosomiasis.

These underscore the need for new antiviral therapies effective against influenza viruses. Understanding how influenza virus uses cellular proteins for infection can potentially identify novel targets for pharmacological intervention. Influenza virus modulates cellular pathways to promote its replication and avoid immune restriction. Here we reveal the interplay between the cellular protein mTOR, which functions in two distinct protein complexes, and influenza virus infection. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is activated during influenza virus infection through a cascade of specific modifications, or phosphorylation events, and by reducing the levels of another cellular protein termed REDD1, which is an mTORC1 inhibitor. Activation of mTORC1 results in additional phosphorylation events that together promote viral protein expression and replication. On the other hand, mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylates AKT at a specific site during infection, which is a process mediated by the viral NS1 protein that is known to regulate viral-mediated cell death. Since these effects occur midway through the virus life cycle in the infected cell, mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation are likely important to regulate the cellular environment in order to facilitate the late stages of viral infection.","Influenza virus usurps host signaling factors to regulate replication. mTORC1 is a cellular regulator of protein synthesis, growth and motility. mTORC1 activation supports viral protein expression and replication. mTORC1 activation supports viral protein expression and replication. mTORC1 activation supports viral protein expression and replication. mTORC1 activation supports viral protein expression and replication. mTORC1 activation supports viral protein expression and replication.",13.707394957983194

Such control systems can often operate in a surprisingly robust manner, in spite of constant perturbations from fluctuating internal conditions and a volatile external environment. What feature makes such control mechanisms robust? Is there a general way to achieve robustness? Here, we address these questions by investigating the wiring of interaction networks, which contains the most condensed information about the control mechanisms of biological systems. We suggest that one of the most important factors in the realization of biological robustness rests in the global coherency of the control strategy, i.e., the consistency of commands flowing through different routes in the network to the same destination. To implement this idea, we propose an order parameter termed ‘regulation entropy’ to quantitatively describe this control consistency of networks. We find that this order parameter correlates with the resistance of the system to external perturbations as well as internal fluctuations. Our results suggest that the self-consistency of the control strategy is important for the vitality and robustness of living organisms.","In biology, biological control networks are important for controlling biological processes such as cell division, replication, and gene expression. However, it is widely believed that topological characteristics of biological control networks largely determine the dynamic behavior of biological control networks.

The main strategy to control schistosomiasis is to regularly treat school-aged children with the drug praziquantel. The frequency of praziquantel treatment depends on the average prevalence of schistosomiasis, which can be defined as low (prevalence <10%), moderate (10–50%), or high (>50%). However, it remains unclear at which geographical scale these prevalence levels should be considered to avoid unnecessary treatments but still comply with local needs. We investigated the effect of the geographical scale for an ensemble of 29 West and East African countries using previously published model-based schistosomiasis risk estimates obtained at high spatial resolution. These estimates allow spatial risk aggregation at different geographical scales (i.e., country, region, district, or pixel level). More than 70 million praziquantel treatments are required every year for school-aged children if countrylevel estimates are used. On a more refined geographical scale (i.e., province), annualized praziquantel treatments increase by 12%. Depending on the averaged schistosomiasis prevalence and the spatial risk variation across a country, the difference in the estimated amount of praziquantel between country-level aggregation and other geographical scales might be very important, as for example in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali.","Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa.

In previous work, we and others have shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is important in protecting from severe fungal infections. We now show that, in addition to the NLRP3 inflammasome, a different inflammasome containing NLRC4 is also important in protecting against infection with Candida albicans, and appears to be functioning in the mucosal lining of the mouth and intestines, rather than in immune cells. Our research explains a new mechanism of mucosal immunity to fungal infections and has broad implications for developing new treatments against fungal infections, which are a serious cause of illness and death, particularly in immunocompromised persons. Additionally, this research may also lead to new ways to identify those individuals who are at the highest risk for serious fungal infections.","Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that colonizes the skin and oral cavity, causing inflammation and disease. Previously, we identified a central role ofP3 inflammasome in regulating IL-1 production and resistance to dissemination of oral infection in Candida albicans.

In order to gain insight into some factors behind this crisis, we have analyzed statistical information extracted from thousands of cognitive neuroscience and psychology research papers. We established that the statistical power to discover existing relationships has not improved during the past half century. A consequence of low statistical power is that research studies are likely to report many false positive findings. Using our large dataset, we estimated the probability that a statistically significant finding is false (called false report probability). With some reasonable assumptions about how often researchers come up with correct hypotheses, we conclude that more than 50% of published findings deemed to be statistically significant are likely to be false. We also observed that cognitive neuroscience studies had higher false report probability than psychology studies, due to smaller sample sizes in cognitive neuroscience. In addition, the higher the impact factors of the journals in which the studies were published, the lower was the statistical power. In light of our findings, the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic, and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.","Cognitive neuroscience is a branch of psychology that studies how the brain processes information.

In the chordate phylum, only colonial ascidians (invertebrate chordates also known as sea squirts) have the documented ability to wholly regenerate. Once separated from the colony, any minute fragment of peripheral blood vessel (about 1 mm in length, containing 100–300 blood cells) of the colonial ascidian Botrylloides leachi regenerates an entire functional adult within one to three weeks. By following cellular and molecular events in Botrylloides WBR, we revealed that this system proceeds differently from regeneration events in other model organisms by several fundamental criteria. This is, for example, to our knowledge the first documented case of WBR initiating from circulating blood cells that restore not only the body tissue, but also the germ line. We found that retinoic acid (RA) signaling, previously reported in the regeneration of specific vertebrate tissues and organs, plays a major role in WBR via RA receptor expression throughout the entire regenerating animal. This suggests that RA signaling may have had ancestral roles in body restoration events. Elucidating the processes involved in this WBR system will improve our understanding of the nature of regeneration and the reduced regeneration capabilities represented in so many vertebrates.","Botrylloides is a species of zooid that has been isolated from the wild and confined in a confined model case. Botrylloides has a unique phenomenon of body regeneration (WBR), in which the entire adult zooid is restored to a tiny blood vessel fragment. In contrast to documented cases, regeneration induced by systemically blood vessels, regeneration in Botrylloides is characterized by multiple buds that appear simultaneously as newly established regeneration niches in vasculature fragments. Multiple buds appear simultaneously as newly established regeneration niches in vasculature fragments, stemming composites of pluripotent blood cells terminating functional zooid. We found that retinoic acid (RA) regulates diverse developmental aspects of WBR, including its arrest of bud malformations and its arrest of multibud formation.

A hallmark of infection with Schistosoma mansoni is the immune response to parasite eggs trapped in the liver and other organs. This response involves an infiltration of cells that surround the parasite egg forming a “granuloma.” In mice deprived of T-cells, this granulomatous response is lacking, and toxic products released by eggs quickly cause liver damage and death. Thus the granulomata protect the host from toxic egg products. Only one hepatotoxic molecule, omega-1, has been described to date. We set out to identify other S. mansoni egg hepatotoxins using liver cells grown in culture. We first showed that live eggs, their secretions, and pure omega-1 are toxic. Using a physical separation technique to prepare fractions from whole egg secretions, we identified the presence of IPSE/alpha-1, a protein that is known to strongly influence the immune system. We showed that IPSE/alpha-1 is also hepatotoxic, and that toxicity of both omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 can be prevented by first mixing the proteins with specific neutralizing antibodies. Both proteins constitute the majority of hepatotoxicity released by eggs.","Schistosoma mansoni is a blood fluke parasite that infects the liver of mammals and causes severe liver disease.

In this work we concentrated on the effect of 3′ end sequences. For this, we constructed a library of yeast strains that differ only by a native 3′ end region integrated downstream to a reported gene driven by a constant inducible promoter. Thus we could attribute all differences in reporter expression between the strains to the different 3′ end sequences. Interestingly, we found that despite being driven by the same strong, inducible promoter, our library spanned a wide and continuous range of expression levels of more than twelve-fold. As these measurements represent the sole effect of the 3′ end region, we quantify the contribution of these sequences to the variance in mRNA levels by comparing our measurements to endogenous mRNA levels. We follow by sequence analysis to find a simple sequence signature that correlates with expression. In addition, single cell analysis reveals distinct noise dynamics of 3′ end mediated differences in expression compared to different levels of promoter activation leading to a more complete understanding of gene expression which also incorporates the effect of these regions.","Understanding gene regulation requires understanding the contribution of regulatory regions to gene expression.

Functionally important protein regions are typically more conserved than other regions because mutations in these regions are more likely to be deleterious. A number of phylogenetic models have been developed to identify conserved sites or regions in proteins by comparing protein sequences from multiple species. However, most of these methods treat amino acid sites independently and do not consider the spatial clustering of conserved sites in the protein tertiary structure. Therefore, their power of identifying functional protein regions is limited. We develop a new statistical model, GP4Rate, which combines the information from the protein sequences and the protein tertiary structure to infer conserved regions. We demonstrate that GP4Rate outperforms Rate4Site, the most widely used phylogenetic software for inferring functional amino acid sites, via simulations with a case study of B7-1 genes. GP4Rate is a potentially useful tool for guiding mutagenesis experiments or providing insights on the relationship between protein structures and functions.","A critical question in biology is the identification of functionally important amino acid sites in proteins.

PEL is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that usually develops in a hypoxic environment. There is no standard treatment for PEL and it carries a poor prognosis. Previous studies have revealed that certain KSHV-encoded genes are activated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), an intracellular factor that mediates much of the cellular response to hypoxia. KSHV in turn can upregulate HIF-1, suggesting HIF-1 might play a substantial role in PEL oncogenesis. Here, we report for the first time the effects of suppressing HIF-1α, an oxygen-sensitive subunit of HIF-1, in PEL tumor cells. We demonstrate that suppressing HIF-1α can dramatically affect the oncogenic metabolic signature of PELs, replication of KSHV, expression of KSHV-encoded oncogenes, and the growth of PEL cells.

The soil bacterium B. subtilis becomes “competent” for the uptake of environmental DNA, thus acquiring new genetic information. About 15% of the cells are chosen for expression of the competence genes by stochastic fluctuations in the transcription of comK. When the concentration of ComK exceeds a critical threshold, it activates its own expression, a molecular switch is thrown, and competence ensues in that cell. Here we ask why all of the cells do not eventually throw the switch. We show that the basal level expression of comK increases and then decreases as nutrients are exhausted, so that the number of cells exceeding the ComK threshold rises and falls, opening and closing a window of opportunity for competence. Two factors responsible for this “uptick” in comK expression are: 1) a global increase in transcription as cell division slows, and 2) a continual rise in the concentration of the master regulatory protein Spo0A-P, which activates and then represses comK as it accumulates. The global increase transmits growth rate information and the increase in Spo0A∼P encodes multiple signals, including the nutritional, replication, and population density status of the culture.","Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) is the most common bacterium in the world.

This gap in knowledge prevents an assessment of the potential for these parasites to infect humans and production animals and is largely due to the difficulty of conducting standard diagnostic tests on wildlife. To address this gap, we adapted a standard diagnostic assay to be used with dried urine samples. We used urine from geladas, primates endemic to Ethiopia, which are frequently infected with the larval stage of a taeniid tapeworm and exhibit protuberant cysts during advanced infection. The use of this diagnostic test in a wild gelada population allowed us to detect that individuals can be infected without exhibiting observable cysts, and that some individuals may control infection in its early stages. This tool provides information about how a neglected tapeworm functions in a wildlife system and opens the door to the non-invasive identification of tapeworm reservoir hosts that may threaten humans.","Taenia serialis is a parasitic worm that infects a wide range of mammals, birds, and reptiles, including humans.

Parasite genetic diversity is related to geographical distribution and transmission cycles and might play a role in clinical manifestations as well as in anti-parasitic chemotherapy response. T. cruzi has been classified into six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs), after consensus reached among experts in the field. In order to effectively use this standardized nomenclature, a reproducible genotyping strategy is needed. Available typing schemes are usually applied to cultured parasite stocks, because they are not sensitive enough to be used in biological specimens. Only nested PCR procedures could directly type biological samples, but are prompt to contamination and require a high number of reactions. Thus, we developed a multiplex Real-Time PCR using TaqMan probes (MTq-PCR) for DTU typing in a single or a second round of amplification.

To test whether limited dengue replication in wMel mosquitoes translates to a reduction in dengue transmission potential, we used a non-destructive assay to repeatedly quantify dengue virus in mosquito saliva. We found that wMel significantly delayed the time it took for mosquito saliva to become infectious, reduced the frequency of dengue virus that was expectorated by mosquitoes and lowered the virus titer in mosquito saliva. We also showed that wMel infection suppresses saliva production in mosquitoes that may, in part, explain our findings. The saliva-based nature of the work provides a more accurate assessment of Wolbachia’s ability to limit disease transmission and suggests that Wolbachia may have positive impacts on transmission not only by reducing the number of infectious mosquitoes in a population but also delaying the arrival of virus in the saliva.","Dengue viruses (Vs) are causative agents of dengue fever, a world-wide arthropod-borne disease that affects 40 % of the world’s population. Wolbachia pipientis, an intracellular bacterium, is a biocontrol strategy for dengue that limits replication of virus mosquito. Wolbachia strain wMel, introduced to mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, is shown to spread near fixation field releases. Standard measures of Wolbachia efficacy blocking virus replication focus on detection of virus in mosquito tissues. In this study, we used a non-destructive assay to quantify the saliva of wMel-infected mosquitoes following consumption of blood meal. We found that wMel lengthens the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of mosquito saliva, which is a key determinant of mosquito ability to transmit Vs. We also found that wMel lengthens the length of the EIP of mosquito saliva compared to wild-type mosquitoes. These observations partially explained the overall reduction in saliva produced by wMel mosquitoes compared to wild-type mosquitoes.",13.534803675856306

In particular, establishing proper connectivity at the midline is critical for the orchestration of rhythmic behaviors. Conserved genetic programs that instruct axon guidance at the midline have been characterized in multiple model systems, but the signaling mechanisms underlying axon guidance are not well understood. Slits and Robos comprise conserved families of axon guidance cues and receptors that control midline guidance by preventing inappropriate midline crossing. Here, we identify a novel mechanism that is required for Robo receptor activation and Robo-dependent axon repulsion in vivo. Using a combination of molecular genetic and cell biological approaches, we define a role for Slit-dependent trafficking of Robo from the plasma membrane to the early and late endosomes that contributes to Robo activation and signaling. In previous work, endocytic trafficking has been shown to modulate axon guidance responses by regulating surface levels of guidance receptors. In contrast, our observations indicate that endocytosis of the Robo receptor itself is required for receptor activation and precedes the recruitment of a key downstream signaling effector to the Robo receptor cytoplasmic domain.","Roundabout (Robo) guidance receptors are required for proper wiring of the cone in vertebrates and invertebrates.

The proper function of the primary cilium relies on a cell's ability to target and concentrate specific receptors to the ciliary membrane – a unique subdomain of the plasma membrane yet little is known about how receptors are trafficked to the primary cilium. Mutations affecting the ciliary localized receptor fibrocystin (PKHD1) cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, which affects approximately 1∶20,000 individuals. Previously we identified a motif located in the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin that is required for its ciliary localization. In this work we demonstrate that the ciliary targeting sequence (CTS) of fibrocystin interacts with the small G protein Arf4 and this interaction is important for the efficient delivery of the CTS to cilia in cultured cells. Disruption of Arf4 in mice results in defects in the non-ciliated visceral endoderm and death at mid-gestation indicating Arf4 has vital functions in addition to ciliary protein trafficking.","Cilia, the primary sensory organelle of the cilium, are responsible for detecting the presence of foreign objects in the environment.

We show that one organism, Streptomyces sp. Mg1, produces antibiotic linearmycins that cause cellular lysis and degradation of a competing colony of Bacillus subtilis. In turn, the B. subtilis activate a resistance mechanism, either transiently or through mutation of a two-component signaling system. Activation of the signaling system produces a suite of identified responses, which include resistance to linearmycins, altered colony morphology that resembles biofilms, and enhanced motility of B. subtilis.

These organelles have various important functions both in motility and sensing the environment. Motile cilia are essential for moving cells as well as moving fluids across a surface. The waveform of motile cilia requires large macromolecular motors; these are the ciliary dyneins. These dynein complexes are assembled in the cytoplasm in a pathway called preassembly, and then transported into cilia. Defects in this process cause a heterogeneous human disease called primary ciliary dyskinesia that results, for example, in the disruption of the motility of respiratory tract cilia, sperm and nodal cilia during development. The mechanisms of the preassembly pathway are not fully understood. In this study, we use a mutation in the well-conserved DYX1C1/PF23 gene of the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Loss of a conserved domain (DYX) reveals a failure to assemble most ciliary dyneins. Preassembly of inner arm dyneins is particularly affected. We find that if dynein arms are not assembled, dynein subunits in the cytoplasm are unstable. We suggest that DYX1C1 may play a role as a scaffold for other preassembly factors and the dynein subunits.","The ciliary dynein complex is a complex of dynein proteins that assemble into dynein arms. The ciliary dynein complex is composed of several dynein proteins that are required for the assembly of the dynein arms.

Here, we show that the dynein protein DYX1C1 is essential for the assembly of the majority of the ciliary dynein arms (IDA) fraction and outer dynein arms (ODA).

Here, we report that the lytic activity of LysGH15 and its CHAP domain is dependent on calcium ions. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we determined the structures of three individual LysGH15 domains using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The crystal structure unexpectedly reveals an “EF-hand-like” calcium-binding site near the Cys-His-Glu-Asn quartet active site groove in the LysGH15 CHAP domain. Furthermore, the calcium ion plays an important role as a switch that modulates the lytic activity of the CHAP domain. Additionally, structure-guided mutagenesis also confirms that both E282 and the zinc ion play an important role in maintaining the lytic activity of the LysGH15 amidase-2 domain. Moreover, the NMR structure and titration-guided mutagenesis identify residues in the LysGH15 SH3b domain that are involved in the interactions with the substrate. The structure of LysGH15 is the first determined lysin structure from a staphylococcal phage, and these results represent a pivotal step forward in understanding this type of lysin.","Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most common bacterial infections in the world.

We provide evidence that a surface protein present in several staphylococcal species forms functional amyloid aggregates to build the biofilm matrix in response to specific environmental conditions. Under low Ca2+ concentrations and acidic pH, Bap is processed and forms insoluble aggregates with amyloidogenic properties. When the Ca2+ concentration increases, metal-coordinated Bap adopts a structurally more stable conformation and as a consequence, the N-terminal region is unable to assemble into amyloid aggregates. The control of Bap cleavage and assembly helps to regulate biofilm matrix development as a function of environmental changes.","Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common bacterium in the United States and is a major cause of antibiotic-resistant infections. In this study, we show that Staphylococcus aureus self-assembles functional amyloid aggregates to build biofilms in response to environmental conditions. This self-assembly is mediated by a protein called Bap, which is a sensor for the amyloid-like structures. We show that Bap is also a sensor for the coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteria that exploit Bap-like proteins to build biofilms in response to pH-driven multicellular behavior mediated by Bap. Our findings define the dual function of Bap, a sensor for the coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteria that exploit Bap-like proteins to build biofilms in response to environmental conditions.",12.352967741935487

Increasing sequence data has made it possible to utilize related genomes, but this is not as straightforward as it may seem, as the evolution of noncoding regulatory regions is relatively poorly understood. In this work we describe a modeling framework and software implementation for aligning multiple DNA sequences to each other while simultaneously predicting functional regions in that DNA (such as the locations where proteins bind to the DNA for the purpose of regulating genes). Those functional regions may or may not be evolutionarily conserved across the sequences. Our framework allows for explicit modeling of evolutionary change across sequences in both the individual nucleotides making up the sequences and in the functional significance of the sequences (functional versus nonfunctional). While most competing frameworks and implementations are limited to a maximum number of sequences and their lengths, ours is scalable. We demonstrate the value of our system by using it to align a set of complex regulatory regions across ten Drosophila species and to predict protein-binding sites in those sequences.","Computational analysis of regulatory elements in DNA is an important problem in understanding the complex nature of eukaryotic gene regulation.

How humans process and represent information associated with objects is thus a fundamental question in neuroscience. Here, we examine the representation of the mechanical properties of objects which define the mapping between the forces applied to an object and the motion that results. Knowledge of this mapping, which can change depending on the orientation with which an object is grasped, is essential for skillful manipulation. Subjects performed a virtual object manipulation task by grasping the handle of a novel robotic interface which simulated the dynamics of a familiar object which could be presented at different orientations. Using this task, we show that adaptation to the properties of a particular object is extremely rapid, and that such adaptation is confined to the specific orientation at which the object is experienced. Moreover, the pattern of adaptation observed when the orientation of the object and its mechanical properties were changed from trial-to-trial was reproduced by a model which included multiple representations and a generalization function tuned for object orientation. These results suggest that the skillful manipulation of objects with familiar dynamics is mediated by multiple context-specific representations.","Motor learning has been extensively studied in the field of dynamic (force-field) perturbations. These perturbations induce movement errors that result in adaptive changes in motor commands.

We show that adaptation mediated by the dual-rate process is more rapid than adaptation mediated by the familiar object dynamics. We also show that adaptation mediated by the familiar object dynamics is more independent of the context in which the object is presented.",12.744380530973451

This was not foreseen by Gause’s seminal competitive exclusion theory, which predicted that simple single niche environments cannot support diversity. We now know that cross-feeding interactions can be a major driver of diversity maintenance in simple environments. Cross-feeding, a relationship wherein one organism consumes metabolites excreted by another, is a ubiquitous feature of natural and clinically-relevant microbial communities and even tumour cell populations. However, it remains unclear how readily such relationships form, and therefore our ability to predict their emergence is limited. Here we developed a mathematical model of cross-feeding and find that this system can display complex dynamics including multi-stable behaviour separated by a critical point. Therefore, the emergence of cross-feeding depends on complex interplay between density and frequency of competitors. Moreover we predict that small changes in environmental conditions can cause abrupt and irreversible shifts from cross-feeding permissive to cross-feeding prohibitive states. We argue that mathematical models are essential tools for disentangling the complexities of cross-feeding interactions.","Cross-feeding is a key factor promoting diversity in extreme and/or nutrient-poor environments.

In this study, we have determined the relationship of the Lewis blood group antigen phenotypes with the risk of symptomatic cholera as well as the severity of disease and immune responses following infection. We show that individuals expressing the Le(a+b−) phenotype were more susceptible to symptomatic cholera, while Le(a–b+) expressing individuals were less susceptible. Individuals with the Le(a–b−) blood group had a longer duration of diarrhea when infected, required more intravenous fluid replacement, and had lower plasma IgA antibody responses to V. cholerae LPS on day 7 following infection.

They propagate by forming a complex consisting of the catalytically active intron RNA and an intron-encoded reverse transcriptase (which converts the RNA to DNA, which can then be reinserted in the host genome). The Ll.LtrB group II intron-encoded protein (LtrA) was found previously to localize to bacterial cellular poles, potentially accounting for the preferential insertion of Ll.LtrB in the replication origin (oriC) and terminus (ter) regions of the Escherichia coli chromosome, which are located near the poles during much of the cell cycle. Here, we identify E. coli genes whose disruption leads both to more diffuse LtrA localization and a more uniform chromosomal distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites, proving that the location of the LtrA protein contributes to insertion-site preference. Surprisingly, we find that LtrA localization in the disruptants is affected by the accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate, which appears to bind basic proteins and delocalize them away from the cellular poles.

In the absence of septins, larvae infected with Shigella exhibit increased mortality and bacterial burdens associated with increased Caspase-1 activity and neutrophil death.

A key mechanism for global switches of the transcriptional program depends on alternative sigma factors that bind the RNA polymerase core enzyme and direct it towards the appropriate stress response genes. Competition of different sigma factors for a limited amount of RNA polymerase is believed to play a central role in this global switch. Here, a theoretical approach is used towards a quantitative understanding of sigma factor competition and its effects on gene expression. The model is used to quantitatively describe in vitro competition assays and to address the question of indirect or passive control in the stringent response upon amino acids starvation. We show that sigma factor competition provides a mechanism for a passive up-regulation of the stress specific sigma-driven genes due to the increased availability of RNA polymerase in the stringent response. Moreover, we find that active separation of sigma factor from the RNA polymerase during early transcript elongation weakens the sigma factor-RNA polymerase equilibrium constant, raising the question of how their in vitro measure is relevant in the cell.","Sigma factors control global genetic expression in bacteria.

This study addresses the mechanism of nucleosome positioning by NoRC and the functional role of the non-coding RNA, which is termed pRNA because it corresponds to the promoter sequence. NoRC recognises the promoter nucleosome in a chromatin array with high affinity and uses a release mechanism to position the nucleosome over the transcription initiation site. The pRNA binds specifically to NoRC and inhibits its ATPase activity.

One important cause of infant mortality worldwide is infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the pneumococcus. All pneumococcal disease begins with asymptomatic colonization of the upper respiratory tract. Infants are also more likely to carry pneumococci, and on average each carriage event has a longer duration. Here, we used an infant mouse model of pneumococcal colonization to study the mechanisms underlying delayed clearance of carriage. We found that infant mice were unable to recruit the effector cells of clearance, macrophages, into the lumen of the upper airway, and that this delay was accompanied by an inability to produce a macrophage chemoattractant in the nasopharynx. We attribute this defect to a dysregulation in the expression of these chemokines and show this effect results from the commensal bacterial flora of infants.

Here, we developed a novel tool: MTB antigen-specific tetrameric CD4+ T-cell receptor (TCR) complexes that can detect MTB peptide-specific antigen presenting cells (APCs) in blood and local tissues. We found that a relatively low level of antigen-specific monocytes (i.e., APCs) was detected in peripheral blood (PBL) samples from untreated TB patients, and then increased to their peak levels during the first month after treatment, which probably had something to do with the decrease in APC apoptosis.

During wound healing epidermal keratinocytes become migratory to close the wound. The transition of keratinocytes between these three different states—progenitor, differentiation and migration-requires the activation of distinct gene expression programs whose regulation is poorly understood. Our study demonstrates how regulatory chromatin domains like typical enhancers and super enhancers interact with transcription factors, resulting in complex layers of regulation with specific transcription factors regulating distinct stages of the epidermal differentiation process. Specifically, the epidermal transcription factor GRHL3 regulates both possible transitions of progenitor epidermal cell: differentiation and migration. We found that both GRHL3 chromatin binding and enhancers relocate as keratinocytes move between functional states. In addition, we show reciprocal regulation between GRHL3 and enhancers: chromatin domains, including a super enhancer, regulate GRHL3 expression, while GRHL3 regulates the formation of a subset of epidermal super enhancers and typical enhancers.","Human keratinocytes are the largest keratinocytes in the human body. They differentiate into two distinct cell types, differentiated keratinocytes and non-differentiated keratinocytes. The differentiation of differentiated keratinocytes into differentiated keratinocytes is irreversible, but the migration of non-differentiated keratinocytes into differentiated keratinocytes is reversible. In this study, we show that a transcription factor, GRHL3, binds preferentially to super-enhancers, differentiating keratinocytes and migration, and binds preferentially to promoters, repressing expression of migration inhibitors. We also show that GRHL3 represses the formation of number of progenitor non- keratinocyte super-enhancers. Furthermore, GRHL3 binds to non-differentiated keratinocyte super-enhancers and regulates the migration of non-differentiated keratinocytes into differentiated keratinocytes.",13.380000000000003

HPVs that infect mucosal epithelia cause infectious lesions in the anogenital tract and oral cavity. HPV infections are normally cleared by the immune system; however, in rare cases, infections can persist for years. Persistent infections by certain HPVs place one at a high risk of developing carcinomas of the cervix, other anogenital tissues, and the head/neck region. These HPVs are responsible for over 5% of all human cancers. For an HPV infection to persist, the viral circular genome must be maintained, i.e. replicated and inherited during cell division. In this study we define the mechanism by which the viral gene E6 contributes to the maintenance of the HPV genome. We demonstrate that E6 must inactivate the cellular factor, p53, for the viral genome to be maintained. Significantly, p53, is inactivated in many types of human cancers and because much research has been done on p53, promising new drugs have been identified that can re-activate p53. If such drugs can re-activate the p53 that has been inactivated by E6, then we hypothesize that these drugs could be used to cure patients with persistent HPV infections and thereby reduce their risk of developing HPV associated cancers.","The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA genome is distinct from the human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA genome in the establishment, maintenance, and maintenance stages of replication. HPV16 E6 protein is required for maintenance of the HPV16 DNA genome, which undergoes extrachromosomal amplification, nuclear amplification, and humanocyte degradation.

Telomeric DNA is maintained though the action of both conventional and non-conventional DNA replication mechanisms. To ensure that chromosome ends are fully protected and fully replicated, telomeres dynamically oscillate between a closed (non-extendable) and an open (extendable) conformation throughout the cell cycle. The telomerase reverse transcriptase engages telomeres when they are in an extendable conformation. How this conversion occurs, how telomerase is recruited to the chromosome terminus and how telomerase action is terminated are unanswered questions. Here we provide evidence that POT1a, a telomerase accessory protein from the flowering plant Arabidopsis, helps to convert the telomere into a telomerase-extendable state through dynamic interactions with a critical telomere binding protein complex, and through stimulation of telomerase enzyme activity. The results of this study provide new insight into the regulation of telomeric DNA replication.","Protection Telomeres 1 (POT1) is a conserved nucleic acid binding protein implicated in telomere replication and chromosome end protection.

In this paper, we administered a monoclonal antibody that blocks the common type I IFN signaling receptor to mice at different times after WNV infection to dissect the temporal functions of IFN. Administration of the blocking antibody at day -1 resulted in a massive increase in viral replication and the number of WNV-specific -CD8+ T cells. In contrast, treatment with a single dose of antibody at day 4 had limited effects on viral dissemination, but instead promoted development of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells that produced lower levels of cytokines and expressed proteins implicated in T cell exhaustion.

Shotgun “metagenomic” sequencing can be used to sample millions of short DNA sequences from such communities directly, without needing to first culture its constituents in the laboratory.

But, annotation is a multi-step process that includes identification of genes in a metagenome and determination of the type of protein each gene encodes. We currently know little about how different choices of parameters during annotation influences the final results.

We then use ShotMAP to functionally characterize marine communities and gut communities in a clinical cohort of inflammatory bowel disease.

ClassTR uses optimization to resolve complex strains into simple strains and explicit models of tandem repeat evolution to classify the infections as clonal (due to within-host diversification) or mixed (due to reinfection).

Regulation of Bim is uniquely important in the pathogenesis of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), since in this human childhood cancer the Myc gene is deregulated by chromosomal translocation and Myc can induce pcd via Bim. Latent EBV represses Bim expression, and here we have discovered that this involves mechanisms that reprogramme B cells and their progeny. EBV does not significantly alter Bim protein or RNA stability, but relief of EBV-mediated repression by specific inhibitors suggested it involves modifications to chromatin. Consistent with this, reduced histone acetylation and increased levels of DNA methylation on the Bim promoter were found after latent EBV infection. Further analysis suggested that the DNA methylation is preceded by repression mediated via a polycomb protein repressive complex targeting the Bim gene. By initiating the heritable suppression of Bim, EBV increases the likelihood of B lymphomagenesis in general and BL in particular. This reprogramming of B cells by EBV may also play a role in the development of other chronic disorders such as autoimmune disease and suggests a general mechanism that could contribute to the pathogenesis associated with other microorganisms.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in humans and is associated with a number of diseases, including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).

Until recently, such networks have primarily been analyzed as fixed structures, which enable interaction between their components (nodes). The present work is one of the first empirical studies investigating the adaptation of complex networks [1]. Network evolution is particularly important for applying complex network analysis to biological systems, where the evolution of the network reflects the biological processes that drive it. Here, we characterize the functional networks obtained from neurons grown in vitro. Network properties are described at seven day intervals during the neurons' maturation period. Initially, neurons formed random networks, which spontaneously reorganized to a ‘small-world’ architecture. The ‘small-world’ concept derives from the study of social networks, where it is referred to as ‘six-degrees of separation’: the connection of any two individuals by as few as six acquaintances. In brain networks, this translates to rapid interaction between neurons, mediated by a few links between locally connected clusters (cliques) of neurons. This architecture is considered optimal for efficient information processing and its spontaneous emergence in cultured neurons is remarkable.","The evolution of functional networks in cultured neurons is similar to that observed in vivo.

Aflatoxins are the most potent naturally occurring carcinogens known and aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus show extensive genetic and mycotoxin diversity. Population genetic studies and experimental matings in the laboratory have revealed the underlying genetic mechanisms and adaptive processes that create and maintain aflatoxin diversity. These studies provided unequivocal evidence of meiosis, crossing over, and aflatoxin heritability, but whether these processes directly influence genetic diversity in nature with respect to aflatoxin formation is not clear. Here, our work with A. flavus, A. parasiticus and A. minisclerotigenes from fields in different continents shows that populations with higher mean recombination rates exhibit less variability in aflatoxin profiles due to genetic intermixing, whereas populations with lower recombination rates have greater variability in aflatoxin profiles due to increased fixation of specific toxin chemotypes. Therefore, sexuality generates novel toxin chemotypes but tends to equalize toxin differences in populations.

Cells employ a remarkable diversity of processes to maintain its homeostasis at all levels of gene expression, including chromatin remodeling, mRNA expression and degradation, translation and protein degradation. Each of these processes shapes cell response at different time scales. In this study, we analyzed the cellular response to oxidative stress at the level of translation. Translation, as one of the most downstream processes in gene expression, provides the necessary plasticity for immediate changes of cellular activities. Using high-sensitive approaches to probe the structural integrity of cellular tRNAs, we show that upon exposure to oxidative stress tRNAs are rapidly deactivated by a cleavage within their ubiquitous, single-stranded 3′-CCA termini by oxidative stress-activated nuclease, angiogenin. The CCA-ends deactivation is reversible and quickly repairable by a ubiquitous enzyme, CCA-adding enzyme, whose natural function is to attach post-transcriptionally the CCA overhang to the 3′-termini of all tRNAs in an mRNA template-independent manner. We propose that this is a mechanism to dynamically repress and reactivate translation at low metabolic costs.","Stress-induced changes in gene expression are crucial for the survival of cells.

Thus, different tissues within an organism must develop specific immune systems for survival. The epidermis acts as a physical barrier and represents a first line of defense against infection and physical injury in a variety of animals. Natural nematophagous fungi, such as Drechmeria coniospora and Clonostachys rosea, infect the epidermis of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans by producing conidia. Here we demonstrated that the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in the epidermis has a direct role in C. elegans defense against fungal infection and physical injury. We found that the EGL-30/EGL-8/IP3/ITR-1 signaling pathway triggers epidermal Ca2+ release through IP3 and its receptor ITR-1 after fungal infection. Ca2+ release induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating a dual-oxidase BLI-3. ROS in turn mediate DAF-16 activation in a Ste20-like kinase-1/CST-1-dependent manner. Thus, DAF-16 could act in a cell-autonomous way in the epidermis as an active regulator of immune responses to fungal infection and physical injury.",Fungal infection is a major cause of skin damage in humans.

First, we systematically studied the biological roles of eight histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) genes in the phytopathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We investigated their roles, especially focusing on their involvement in infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity. The results showed that the eight KMTs were involved in various infection processes to varying degrees, and that MoSET1, one of the KMTs catalyzing methylation at histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), had the largest impact on the pathogenicity of the fungus. Second, we focused on the role of MoSET1 in global gene regulation. H3K4 methylation is generally believed to be an epigenetic mark for gene activation in higher eukaryotes. However, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SET1 was originally characterized as being required for transcriptional silencing of silent mating-type loci. We addressed this apparent discrepancy by examining genome-wide gene expression and H3K4 methylation during infection-related morphogenesis in M. oryzae. RNA-seq analysis of a MoSET1 deletion mutant revealed that MoSET1 was indeed required for proper gene activation and repression. ChIP-seq analyses of H3K4 methylation and MoSET1 suggested that MoSET1 could directly play a role in gene activation while MoSET1-dependent gene repression may be caused by indirect effects.","Magnaporthe oryzae is a phytopathogenic fungus that infects wheat, barley, and other crops.

The parasites that cause African sleeping sickness are transmitted between humans and livestock by the tsetse fly. Controlling the spread of the parasite by tsetse flies has been proposed as a promising strategy for reducing the incidence of sleeping sickness. One potential control method relies on releasing genetically modified tsetse that are resistant to carrying the sleeping sickness parasite. For this strategy to be successful, resistant tsetse must be able to invade the susceptible tsetse population. Here, we used a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of such a strategy and the implications for sleeping sickness prevalence in humans and livestock.

In the present study, we identified regions of common methylation variation in five cell types, observing that these show enrichments for functional genomic features. Surprisingly, we found that these epigenetic variations can form biologically relevant networks that are specific to each cell type, often occurring near genes that have functional relevance to the cell type. Further these regions show reduced heritability, suggesting they may be responsive to environmental cues. We confirmed this by subjecting isogenic fibroblast cultures to different environmental stress. Our study provides insight into patterns of normal epigenetic variation in the human population.","Epigenetic variation is a common feature of the human genome and has been shown to underlie a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.

If performance drops, we need to change our behaviour. We do this by adjusting cognitive control, an ensemble of processes through which behaviour is adapted to suit the task. In this study, we first used chronic recordings in the frontal lobe of macaque monkeys to characterise neurophysiological markers that reflect these processes: a brain potential reflecting performance monitoring and a sustained oscillatory signal reflecting cognitive control. It has been suggested that cognitive control, performance monitoring, and their neurophysiological markers are under the influence of dopamine. To understand how the input of dopamine is critical, we followed changes in the markers and performance during slow dopaminergic depletion. This protocol doubles up as a study of the early phase of Parkinson’s disease, when dopaminergic cells are dying but motor symptoms have yet to emerge. Whilst the performance monitoring potential attenuated at the end of the depletion, the performance itself did not. The oscillatory signals showed only subtle changes in comparison, despite the depletion. Together these results bring into question the simple idea that dopamine directly modulates frontal cortex, which in turn directly modulates cognition. We consider how the brain may compensate for a dopamine lesion, and whether the markers measure what we think they do. Our results question a current idea that neurophysiological markers can be directly used to predict dopamine loss in patients with conditions like Parkinson’s disease.","Dopamine is thought to play a central role in the brain’s ability to control behaviour.

The junctions observed at rearrangements typically show only a few base pairs in common between the partners, suggesting that they were formed by the end-to-end joining process, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). However, there is uncertainty about the mechanisms that actually create mutated junctions. DNA ligase IV catalyzes restorative double-strand break (DSB) joining in the canonical NHEJ pathway, but increasing evidence suggests that distinct NHEJ pathways that use DNA ligases I and/or III might be more important for mutations. We used yeast to study the in vivo consequence of having DNA ligase IV that was catalytically inactive but that nonetheless accumulated at DSBs normally. We detected mutated junctions in some assays that required DNA ligase IV protein but not its catalytic activity. This pattern suggests that DNA ligase I creates many mutated junctions when DNA ligase IV is present and that this can become a predominant mode of repair when DNA ligase IV activity is inefficient. Our yeast ligase IV mutations have properties similar to those observed in the human ligase IV syndrome, underscoring the relevance of these observations.","DNA ligase IV (Dnl4 budding yeast) is a specialized ligase that specialized in ligase non-end joining (NHEJ) DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).

One potential solution to reduce toxicity is to use the nematicide at a lower concentration in combination with a second compound that together will produce a synergistic killing effect. That is, the use of either molecule alone at low concentrations is non-lethal, but when used together at these same concentrations, the cocktail is lethal. This strategy has two benefits. First, the killing effect is concentrated at the site of use and as the two molecules diffuse from the targeted site, toxicity is negated. Second, less of the toxic molecule is needed and therefore less is dispersed into the environment. Here, we describe our use of a model nematode called C. elegans to search for molecules that interact with aldicarb, which is one of the nematicides being phased out by environmental agencies. We identified 20 compounds that interact with aldicarb and describe how one of these, called wact-86, functions with aldicarb to kill worms. Our work provides proof-of-principle that C. elegans is a useful model for identifying compounds that positively interact with industrial nematicides and for understanding the nature of such interactions.","Parasitic nematodes are a major public health problem worldwide, and the availability of nematicidal agents is limited by the availability of nematicidal agents that are favourable to the toxicity of the nematodes.

This group includes major pathogens of humans and animals as well as symbionts of protists. Unlike most other bacteria, chlamydiae alternate between two distinct developmental stages. Here we provide novel insights into the infective stage, the elementary body (EB), which has been described almost a century ago and is commonly referred to as an inert spore-like particle. Our analyses of EBs of the amoeba symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila provide a detailed overview of their metabolism outside of, and independent from, their natural host cells. We demonstrated that these EBs are capable of respiration and are active in the major routes of central carbon metabolism, including glucose import, biosynthetic reactions, and catabolism for energy generation. Glucose starvation resulted in a rapid decline of metabolic activity in P. amoebophila EBs and a concomitant decrease in their potential to infect new host cells. The human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis was also dependent on nutrient availability for extracellular survival. The extent of metabolic activity in chlamydial EBs and its consequences for infectivity challenge long-standing textbook knowledge and demonstrate that the infective stage is far more dependent on its environment than previously recognized.","Chlamydiae is a highly successful group of intracellular bacteria, ranging from major pathogens in humans and animals to symbionts, including Protochlamydia amoebophila, a major human pathogen.

In this study, we performed a combined metabolomics approach, including fluorescence microscopy-based assay, ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform mass spectrometry (ICR/FT/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS), to analyze the effect of nutrient deprivation on chlamydial infectivity. We found that P. amoebophila EBs maintain respiratory activity free of D-glucose, including substrate uptake and host-free anabolic synthesis.

This strategy is called intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy (ISTp).Our team conducted a two-arm, open-label trial to compare the effect of the new ISTp with DP (ISTp-DP) strategy against the existing IPTp with SP (IPTp-SP) strategy (the control arm) in 1,873 pregnant women in southern Malawi, where almost all of the malaria parasites were highly resistant to SP.We found that the rate of malaria infection was high in both groups and that the new ISTp-DP strategy was not any better than the existing IPTp-SP strategy in terms of reducing malaria infection or improving pregnancy outcomes; in fact, women in the ISTp-DP arm had more malaria than women in the IPTp-SP arm.ISTp-DP with the current generation of rapid diagnostic tests is not a viable alternative strategy to replace IPTp-SP in malaria endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the high levels of resistance to SP.IPTp with SP should still be used as one of the interventions against malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa.Further studies to explore alternative drugs that can replace SP for IPTp will be required in these areas of high SP resistance.","Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

The main results of the trial were previously published without drug concentrations which were not available at the time of publication. The purpose of this study was to report favipiravir concentrations achieved in participants in the JIKI trial and to compare them with the targeted concentrations. We analyzed drug concentrations obtained at Day-2 and Day-4 and compared them to the targeted concentrations. At Day-2, favipiravir concentrations were significantly below but still close to the targeted concentration. At Day-4, a significant and unanticipated drop of concentrations as compared to Day-2 was observed. The origin of the lower-than-targeted concentrations and the unexpected drop could be due to severe sepsis conditions and/or to intrinsic properties of favipiravir metabolism. No significant correlation was found between the drug exposure and the virological response, indicating that it is possible that the favipiravir concentrations in the JIKI trial were not sufficient to strongly inhibit the viral replication. These findings suggest the necessity of performing dose-ranging studies with high doses of favipiravir in healthy volunteers to inform any further development of favipiravir for treatment of EVD.","Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) is an infectious disease caused by the Ebola virus that is endemic in West Africa.

Here we investigated the effect of four chemical compounds (bafilomycin, mycophenolic acid, castanospermine, and deoxynojirimycin), known to inhibit the host factors vacuolar H+-ATPase (vATPase), inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and glucosidases, on dengue virus replication in adult mosquitoes.

Ingestion of bafilomycin and mycophenolic acid also inhibited virus replication. We showed that the predicted target genes of bafilomycin and mycophenolic acid function as virus host factors in adult mosquitoes through RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Inhibition of vATPase also decreases mosquito longevity and fecundity, thereby further compromising vector capacity.

Despite the growing body of evidence supporting this hypothesis, previous studies on miR-34 have been done in vitro or using non-physiologic expression levels of miR-34. Here, we probe the tumor suppressive functions of the miR-34 family in vivo by generating mice carrying targeted deletion of the entire miR-34 family. Our results show that the miR-34 family is not required for tumor suppression in vivo, and they suggest p53-independent functions for this family of miRNAs. Importantly, the mice generated from this study provide a tool for the scientific community to further investigate the physiologic functions of the miR-34 family.","MicroRNAs belonging to the microRNA-34 family have been identified as critical modulators of the p53 pathway potential tumor suppressors in human cancers. In this study, we generated mice carrying targeted deletions of members of the microRNA-34 family. We found that p53 function is intact in mice carrying targeted deletions of members of the microRNA-34 family. However, p53-deficient mice display increased susceptibility to spontaneous, irradiation-induced, and c-Myc- initiated tumorigenesis. Furthermore, contrast with p53-deficient mice, mice carrying targeted deletions of members of the microRNA-34 family display increased susceptibility to spontaneous, irradiation-induced, and c-Myc- initiated tumorigenesis.",13.494981132075473

By studying a domesticated strain of C. elegans, we identify a beneficial mutation that regulates a number of life history tradeoffs.

The virulence strategy of EPEC revolves around a conserved Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) which translocates bacterial effector proteins directly into host cells. EPEC is considered to be a non-invasive pathogen which intimately adheres to host cells and polymerizes actin rich pedestals on which extracellular bacteria rest. Recently we have identified the T3SS effector EspT which activates the mammalian Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, resulting in the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia. In this study we dissect the signaling pathway utilized by EspT to nucleate membrane ruffles and demonstrate that these ruffles can promote EPEC invasion of host cells. Furthermore, we show that internalized EPEC are bound within a vacuole. We also report for the first time the ability of a bacterial pathogen to form actin comet tails across a vacuole membrane.

One strategy to combat antibiotic resistance is the use of synergistic antibiotic pairs that, when combined, have activity that is considerably greater than the sum of each individual drug’s activity on its own. Synergistic combinations can even inhibit the growth of bacteria that are resistant to the individual treatment drugs. However, synergistic pairs are rare and difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic pairs is challenging due to scale: 1 million different pairs are possible for a relatively small collection of 1,000 small molecules. Here, we describe a high-throughput method for rapid identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs, termed the overlap2 method (O2M), that dramatically speeds up the screening process. First, we identify mutants that show the same phenotype when treated with each individual molecule in a synergistic pair, then use this information to guide screens for additional synergistic pairs. As a proof of concept, we studied the synergistic antibiotic pair trimethoprim and sulfamethizole, and we identified several additional synergistic molecules. Among these is the antiviral drug azidothymidine (AZT), which blocks bacterial DNA replication. Trimethoprim and sulfamethizole both inhibit folate biosynthesis, which is necessary for the proper synthesis of nucleotides for DNA replication and repair. We found that reduced nucleotide levels sensitize E. coli cells to AZT. When we substitute trimethoprim with other small molecules that also reduce nucleotide levels, we find that these small molecules also act synergistically with AZT. Indeed, AZT in combination with trimethoprim substitutes inhibits the growth of trimethoprim-resistant clinical isolates more potently than trimethoprim and AZT or trimethoprim and sulfamethizole. This work demonstrates that when we resolve the pathways that underlie synergistic interactions, we can then identify additional small molecules that act by similar mechanisms, providing a means to bypass antibiotic resistance.","Antibiotic resistant infections kill approximately 23,000 people per year in the United States and cost $ 20,000,000,000 per year in the United States despite widespread use of small-molecule antimicrobial combination therapy.

The loss of Filamin B, a protein component of the cell’s cytoskeletal structure, gives rise to Spondylocarpotarsal Synostosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by fusions of the vertebral bodies. Similarly, mice lacking the Filamin B protein show fusions of the vertebral bodies. We found that these fusions are caused by the early degeneration and eventual ossification of the IVDs. Our study demonstrates that this degeneration is caused by the increase in TGFβ and BMP activity, developmental pathways essential in bone and cartilage formation. These findings represent a significant step forward in our understanding of the molecular basis of IVD degeneration. as well as revealing filamin B’s role in TGFβ/BMP signaling regulation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the study of the rare disease spondylocarpotarsal synostosis in a model organism can uncover mechanisms underlying more common diseases.

Furthermore their genomes encode functions not supposed to be in a virus, such as components of the protein translation apparatus. Since Lwoff in 1957, viruses are defined as ultimate obligate intracellular parasites from their need to hijack the peptide synthesis machinery of their host to replicate. We looked at the Mimivirus and Megavirus proteins that recognize the stop codons, the translation termination factors. We found that these genes contain two internal stop codons, meaning that their translation bypasses two distinct stop codons to produce a functional translation termination factor. These types of autoregulatory mechanisms are found in bacterial termination factors, although it involves only a single internal stop codon and not two, and are absent from their eukaryotic and archaeal homologs. Despite these bacterial-like features, giant viruses' termination factors have sequences that do not resemble bacterial genes but are clearly related to the eukaryotic and archaeal termination factors. Thus, giant viruses' termination factors surprisingly combine elements from eukaryotes/archaea and bacteria.","Megaviruses are the largest viruses in the world.

Action potential propagation recruits tissue for contraction over short distances, but a single action potential sweeping through the uterus cannot explain organ-level function. Multiple action potentials seem to arise simultaneously, and apparently spontaneously, in different “regions” of the uterine wall. We interpret the existence of regions as a consequence of there being a maximum distance a single action potential can travel. To explain the synchronization of regional contractions, we use a second mechanism: initiation of contractions by stretch. Because the uterus is pressurized, contraction of the first region raises the intrauterine pressure slightly, which stretches the entire uterine wall. The stretch recruits another regional contraction, which generates more pressure. This positive feed-back recruits most regions into simultaneous activity. With this mechanism we simulate the contraction patterns of human labor, and show how contractions emerge from complex interactions. We explain why the decades-long search for the uterine pacemaker has failed, and why drugs that stimulate or inhibit tissue contractions have enigmatic effects at the organ-level. This simulation, for the first time, successfully links tissue experiments to clinical obstetrics.","The uterine wall is one of the most important structures in the human body.

We reveal that the G. obscuriglobus cells are neither compartmentalized nor nucleated, contrary to previous claims, as none of the spaces created by the membrane invaginations is topologically closed; instead, they are all interconnected. The organization of cellular space is similar to that of a classical Gram-negative bacterium modified by the presence of large invaginations of the inner membrane inside the cytoplasm.

Th2 cells are commonly associated with allergies, asthma and helminth infections. A common helminth infection that infects over 120 million people worldwide is lymphatic filarial infection caused by filarial parasites. We show here data that filarial infection is associated with the expansion of two types of Th2 cells, one which produces IL-4 and IL-13 alone without IL-5 and the other which produces all three cytokines. Interestingly, while the former subset is associated with the levels of antibodies - IgG4 and IgE; the latter is associated with the presence of eosinophilia in filarial infected individuals. In addition, these subsets appear to be modulated differently by the immunoregulatory cytokines - IL-10 and TGFβ. Therefore, our study highlights a novel regulation of Th2 cells and suggests that the Th2 compartment is quite heterogeneous in phenotype with possible functional consequences.","Different Th2 subsets are defined recently based on IL-5 expression- IL-5+Th2 subset IL-5Th2 subset setting allergy.

During a viral infection, important pattern recognition receptors include the endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and a second set of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors known as the RNA helicases. Many studies have highlighted the importance of TLR3, TLR7/8 and the RNA helicases in providing robust anti-viral immunity via interferon induction and inflammation. Both endosomal TLR and cytoplasmic RNA helicase mediated pathways are believed to exist as separate yet non-redundant entities; however, little thought is given to why both systems exist, and few studies also consider how both pathways together contribute to anti-viral immunity. Using models of rhinovirus infection in primary bronchial epithelial cell culture in vitro and experimental infection in mouse and human models in vivo, we show that the RNA helicases are preferentially induced early in the infection cycle via TLR3 mediated signaling events, and work in a co-ordinated, systematic manner. The results help understand the complex events that determine effective innate immunity to rhinovirus infection and how these processes contribute to virus induced exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Rhinovirus infection is a major cause of respiratory infections in humans and is a major cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARS) in developing countries.

Neurofilaments are cargoes of intracellular transport that move along microtubule tracks, and they accumulate abnormally in axons in many neurotoxic and neurodegenerative disorders. Intriguingly, it has been reported that neurofilaments and microtubules, which are normally interspersed in axonal cross-sections, often segregate apart from each other in these disorders, which is something that is never observed in healthy axons.

We previously observed cells in microfluidic channels and studied their polarization and motility in a simplified (nearly 1 dimensional) geometry. There, precise gradients of chemically-inducible molecular probes were presented to elicit gradients of active Rac, independent of the upstream signaling. Here we develop a set of spatio-temporal mathematical models to account for the observed polarization behaviour of those cells, and their threshold response to induced Rac activity. These reaction-diffusion models for the interactions of signaling proteins (GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42) and membrane lipids (phosphoinositides PIP, , ) are analyzed by a new method (‘Local Perturbation Analysis’) that explores the effect that pulses of stimuli have on local (global) variables, i.e. those intermediates that have slow (fast) rates of diffusion. Together, the models and experiments suggest that (1) spatially uniform stimulation makes the cells more sensitive to applied gradients. (2) Feedback between phosphoinositides and Rho GTPases sensitizes a cell. (3) Cell lengthening/flattening accompanying polarization can increase the sensitivity of a cell and stabilize an otherwise unstable polarization.","The polarization of cells is an important process in many biological processes, such as cell division, cell division, and cell death.

Computational models permit exploration of possible alternative mechanisms that reproduce biological patterns and thereby provide hypotheses for empirical testing. In this article, we describe a biologically motivated discrete stochastic model that shows that the patterns of spots and stripes of tightly packed cells observed in cultures derived from the embryonic vertebrate limb can occur by a mechanism that uses only cell–cell signaling via diffusible molecules (morphogens) and cell substratum adhesion (haptotaxis). Moreover, similar-looking patterns can arise both from stable stationary dynamics and unstable transient dynamics of the same underlying core molecular–genetic mechanism. Simulations also show that spot and stripe patterns (which also correspond to the nodules and bars of the developing limb skeleton in vivo) are close in parameter space and can be generated in multiple ways with single-parameter variations. An important implication is that some developmental processes do not require a strict progression from one stable dynamic regime to another, but can occur by a succession of transient dynamic regimes tuned (e.g., by natural selection) to achieve a particular morphological outcome.","Limb bud precartilage is the first stage in the development of the vertebrate skeleton.

We found that a functionally enriched set of mRNA are destabilized, including some members of the Nitrogen Catabolite Repression regulon.

Virus productive replication, in addition to latency, is important for maintaining viral load within the host and also for KS pathogenesis. Essential to HHV-8 and other virus replication is the control of innate host defenses, which comprise stress-sensing cellular signaling pathways that result ultimately in programmed cell death (apoptosis).

Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying innate immune sensing of MVA are poorly characterized.

Most notably, more than 80% of colon cancers arise from aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway. A better understanding of how Wnt signaling functions in the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) during homeostasis and in disease states is thus critical. The Drosophila digestive tract provides a powerful genetic model and an entry point to study these questions. Here, we find that the Wg ligand and pathway activation are enriched at Drosophila intestinal compartment boundaries and are essential for development and homeostasis of the adult gut. During homeostasis, Wg signaling in enterocytes is required to prevent the overproliferation of ISCs non-autonomously. In addition, during development, Wg signaling ensures proper cell fate specification near compartment boundaries.

We show that Wg signaling is essential for the control of ISC proliferation inside the intestine, and that Wg pathway activation is required to specify cell fate near compartment boundaries. We also show that Wg pathway activation is required to suppress JAK-STAT signaling required for ISC proliferation inside the intestine. We conclude that Wg signaling is essential for the control of stem cell proliferation inside the intestine, and that Wg pathway activation is required to specify cell fate near compartment boundaries.",16.33639694656489

One critical step is muscle fiber elongation; muscle precursor cells are short and subsequent elongation/fusion generates long, multinucleate muscle fibers. Using a vertebrate model organism, the zebrafish, we find that single round myoblasts elongate to span the entire width of the myotome prior to fusion. Using rigorous and objective mathematical characterization techniques, we can further divide muscle development into three stages: short precursor cells, intercalation/elongation, and boundary capture/myotube formation. The second phase, elongation, occurs via a two-step mechanism of protrusion extension and filling. Myotube formation involves boundary capture, where the ends of muscle fibers anchor themselves to the myotome boundary and stop elongating. We show that the protein laminin is required for boundary capture, normal fiber length, and proper fiber orientation. Genetic mosaic experiments in laminin-deficient embryos reveal that boundary capture is a cell autonomous phenomenon. Wild-type (normal) cells capture the boundary appropriately and stop elongating in laminin-deficient embryos. Although adhesion to laminin has been implicated in muscular dystrophies where the attachment between muscle cells and tendons fails, no early developmental requirements for laminin in fast muscle morphogenesis have been shown until now.","Skeletal muscle morphogenesis transforms short muscle precursor cells into long, multinucleate myotubes that anchor myotendinous junction (MTJ) tendons. In vertebrates, great deal is known about muscle specification somitic cells, but little is known about the cellular mechanisms that generate long muscle short cells. Here, we show that zebrafish fast muscle fiber morphogenesis consists of discrete phases: short precursor cells, intercalation / elongation, boundary capture, and myotube formation. The second phase, intercalation / elongation, proceeds-step process: protrusion extension filling. The third phase, protrusion extension filling, proceeds-step process: boundary capture. Finally, ends muscle fiber anchor MTJ (boundary capture) and undergo morphogenetic changes adopt stereotypically, cylindrical shape myotubes. We find that the basement membrane protein laminin is required for efficient elongation, proper fiber orientation, and boundary capture.

There is a striking lack of information on the blood-feeding rates of Triatominae in field conditions, and factors modifying the fraction of bugs that feed on humans have rarely been investigated. Here we tested whether the spring fraction of bugs' feeding contacts with humans would decrease when dogs and chickens are available in human sleeping quarters in a well-defined endemic rural area in northwestern Argentina. On average, late-stage bugs fed every four days in spring and the majority fed on humans. The results demonstrate that both the percentage of human-fed bugs and the daily rate of feeding on humans decreased substantially with increasing proportions of chicken- or dog-fed bugs in the house, or the presence of chickens indoors. Combined with earlier findings on the seasonal dynamics of bug abundance, host-feeding patterns and the relative infectivity of domestic hosts, the net effects of the presence of chickens and dogs in human sleeping quarters is predicted to increase the transmission of T. cruzi in summer when chickens move outdoors.","Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Triatoma infestans, which is transmitted to humans by blood-sucking insects.

On the other hand, in patients suffering from innate or acquired immune deficiencies, CMV can cause severe disease or death. Infection of mice with the mouse CMV (MCMV) is an experimental model to study the biology of CMV infection, and mice that lack all of their lymphocytes are very susceptible to MCMV and die typically within three weeks of infection. In this article we show that MCMV causes disease and death in mice lacking lymphocytes because its gene M36 blocks programmed cell death, or apoptosis. MCMV lacking the M36 gene grew thousand folds less well in these mice, which significantly improved survival. This was because M36 deletion made MCMV susceptible to the action of macrophages, cells that secrete soluble factors that induce apoptosis. Importantly, viral growth and virulence of the M36-deficient MCMV could be restored by blocking apoptosis by other means, showing that the block of apoptosis was critical for viral replication. Therefore, our data imply that viral inhibition of apoptosis may be a key molecular target for antiviral strategies in immunodeficient hosts.","cytomegalovirus (CMMV) is a major cause of human cytomegalovirus-related diseases such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus-associated encephalitis (CSA).

It is thus vitally important to reconstruct protein-protein interactions (PPIs) before we can fully understand biological processes. However, critical difficulties exist. Particularly the rate of wrongly predicting PPIs to be true (false positive rate) is extremely high in PPIs prediction. The traditional approaches of error correction from each generating source can be both time-consuming and inefficient. We propose a method that can substantially reduce false positive rates by emphasizing information from more reliable data sources, and de-emphasizing less reliable sources. We indicate that it is indeed the case from our extensive studies. Our predictions also suggest that large numbers of not only false positives but also false negatives may exist in previous studies, as validated by two human PPIs datasets having high quality. The ability to predict large numbers of PPIs both reliably and automatically may inspire people to use computational approaches to correct data errors in general, and speed up PPIs prediction with high quality.

A special class of promoters, known as bidirectional promoters, regulates expression of two genes instead of one. These promoters are situated between two adjacent genes whose transcription start sites are physically within 1,000 bp and oriented in opposite directions. Bidirectional promoters are found repeatedly in the genome, suggesting an important biological significance for this regulatory configuration. We developed an algorithm to map bidirectional promoters using data from a comprehensive list of transcribed sequences known as expressed sequence tags, or ESTs. This approach improved the number of previously characterized bidirectional promoters by 300%. Included in the new data are bidirectional promoters that regulate expression of genes implicated in somatic cancers. For instance, ten well-recognized genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers were identified as having bidirectional promoters. Three of the genes are further related by having duplicate copies of the same binding site for a transcription factor within their bidirectional promoters. These binding sites are conserved among species, providing greater evidence that they are functionally important. This example, in which similar regulatory structures are used to control genes involved in cancer, illustrates how data can be mined from the comprehensive set of bidirectional promoters. Within this manuscript, we show statistical evidence that many cancer genes are regulated by bidirectional promoters. These promoters will be a valuable dataset for studying the role of gene regulation in tumor development.","A gene pair is a pair of adjacent genes that are regulated by a region of the human genome called the “ bidirectional promoter.” This region of the human genome has been implicated in the development of a number of human diseases, including breast and ovarian cancers.

Dysregulation of the HPA axis is associated with a number of neuroimmune disorders including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), depression, Gulf War illness (GWI), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective diagnosis and targeted treatments of these disorders have proven challenging because they present no obvious lesion. However, the body's various components do not work in isolation, and it is important to consider exactly how their interactions might be altered by disease. Using a relatively simple mathematical description of the HPA axis, we show how the complex dynamical behavior of this system will readily accommodate multiple stable resting states, some of which may correspond to chronic loss of function. We propose that a well-directed push given at the right moment may encourage the axis to reset under its own volition. We use model-based predictive control theory to compute such a push. The result is counterintuitive and challenges the conventional time-invariant approach to disease and therapy. Indeed we demonstrate that in some cases it might be possible to exploit the natural dynamics of these physiological systems to stimulate recovery.","The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the major system of maintaining the body's hormone levels and regulating the neuroendocrine sympathetic nervous systems.

Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanisms behind adaptation processes in human skeletal muscle.

Such findings are emblematic of the complex mechanisms regulating the effects of training. We also find that training changes the activity of functionally unknown parts of the genome, with the potential for new proteins involved in the health-enhancing effects of exercise. Additionally, our results challenge the belief of a skeletal muscle memory, where previous training can affect the response to a subsequent training period.

Decades of experiments on one of the smallest model animals, the fruit fly Drosophila, has illustrated significant similarities with the mammal circadian system. Within Drosophila, the PERIOD and TIMELESS proteins are central to controlling this rhythmicity and were recently shown to have a rapid and stable association creating an “interval” timer in the cell's cytoplasm. This interval timer creates the necessary delay between the expression and activity of these genes, and is directly opposed to the previous hypothesis of a delay created by slow association. We use several mathematical models to investigate the unknown factors controlling this timer.

In this study, we temporarily inactivated one of these areas in the monkey parietal cortex and measured the effect on the network of brain areas involved in three-dimensional shape processing using functional brain imaging. Surprisingly, reversible inactivation of a parietal area not only reduced the functional activations in other parietal areas, but also in distantly separate brain areas such as the inferotemporal cortex. Moreover, parietal inactivation also caused a significant perceptual deficit in a depth-structure discrimination task. Electrical microstimulation of the inactivation site revealed that almost all of the observed effects were indirect, i.e., arising through a different brain area. Thus, a combination of functional brain imaging, causal perturbation methods, and behavioral measurements in monkeys can elucidate the flow of three-dimensional object information in the primate brain.","The visual system of primates consists of two streams, the ventral stream and the dorsal stream. The ventral stream is the specialized object recognition stream, and the dorsal stream is the crucial spatial vision actions.

We found that CIP inactivation reduced fMRI activations in the posterior parietal cortex and the inferotemporal cortex (ITC) of the ventral stream.

A minimum variance model would predict that the motor system plans movements that minimize motor error (as measured by the variance in movement) subject to the constraint that the movement be completed within a specified time limit. A complementary model would predict that the motor system minimizes movement time subject to the constraint that movement variance not exceed a certain fixed threshold. But neither of these models is adequate to predict performance in everyday tasks that include external costs imposed by the environment where good performance requires that the motor system select a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. In driving to the airport to catch a plane, for example, there are very real costs associated with driving too fast and also with being just a bit too late. But the “optimal” tradeoff depends on road conditions and also on how important it is to catch the plane. We examine motor performance in analogous experimental tasks where we impose arbitrary monetary costs on movements that are “late” or “early” and show that humans systematically trade off risk and reward so as to maximize their expected monetary gain.","Motor control requires the generation of precise temporal sequence control signals sent to the skeletal musculature.

Staphylococcal binding to fibrinogen or fibrin is an important attribute of disease pathogenesis, which leads to the formation of abscesses and bacterial persistence in host tissues. We report here that Coa and vWbp are essential for S. aureus strain Newman abscess formation and persistence in host tissues.

The disease is generally restricted to those living in low-income settings with poor sanitation.

To better understand typhoid fever in Cambodia, we accessed routine hospital data for typhoid fever from a single healthcare facility treating sick children in Siem Reap in the central Cambodia between 2007 and 2014. We mapped the location of these cases and examined population-based risk factors for reported disease. Additionally, we decoded the genomes of the S.

We found a large burden of typhoid fever in children in this largely rural setting in central Cambodia.

Here, we have developed a novel entry/uncoating assay based on the degree of exposure of a virion-packaged mRNA reporter to the translation machinery (EURT). Using this assay, we highlight here that at least two measurable kinds of viral capsids coexist during HIV-1 infection: one defined as open, in which the viral genome is readily accessible to translation and another that we define as closed, in which access to the genome is prevented until the artificial destabilization of capsids. Our data points to the former as dead-end products of infection and indicate the latter as the commonly referred infectious viral cores. Interestingly, we show here that despite the fact that reverse transcription reshapes viral cores, these structures maintain an exquisite ability to shield the viral genome from the cytoplasmic environment. Finally, IFNα that negatively impacts HIV-1 replication increases the proportion of open viral cores to the detriment of closed ones, suggesting a core-destabilizing activity driven by interferon-regulated proteins. Overall, this assay sheds new light on the behavior of viral cores inside target cells.","HIV-1 capsids are the most common cause of HIV infection in humans.

Early intervention with viral replication is especially critical in central nervous system infections to reduce loss of non-renewable cells and mitigate immune pathology. One of the best characterized anti-viral mechanisms is mediated by ribonuclease L (RNase L). RNase L exerts activity at multiple levels, including degradation of viral and host RNA, induction of apoptosis, and propagation of the IFN-α/β pathway. Recent studies suggest that RNase L antiviral activity is dependent on the virus, as well as the cell type and tissue infected. This study demonstrates that RNase L protects mice infected with a sub-lethal, demyelinating neurotropic coronavirus by ameliorating encephalitis and morbidity, albeit without affecting control of infectious virus or IFN-α/β expression. RNase L specifically protected the brain stem from sustained infection and prevented spread of virus to microglia/macrophages located in spinal cord grey matter. The subtle regional alteration in tropism in the absence of RNase L coincided with increased apoptotic cells and earlier onset as well as increased severity of axonal damage and demyelination. The results demonstrate how subtle regional alterations in viral tropism within the CNS may severely affect the balance between neuroprotection and neurotoxicity mediated by microglia/macrophages.","IFN-/ plays a critical role in limiting viral spread, restricting viral tropism and protecting mice from neurotropic coronavirus infection.

It is increasingly becoming clear that mathematical modeling, and in particular network modeling, of disease spread can aid in analyzing and mitigating these spreads. Here, we develop a network model for the spread and control of a zoonotic infection, focusing particularly on a case study of brucellosis transmission and control among wildlife, cattle herds, and human subpopulations in an agricultural community. After motivating and formulating the model, we introduce tools for 1) parameterization of the model from time-course and snapshot data, 2) simulation and analysis of the model, and 3) optimal design of control policies using the model.

In the laboratory, procyclic forms (the form that multiplies in the midgut), are routinely cultured at 27°C. When procyclic forms are heated to temperatures of 37°C and above, they decrease protein production, and at 41°C, mRNAs aggregate into granules. We show here that quite a large number of mRNAs are not included in granules and continue to be used for making proteins. Some of the proteins that continue to be made are needed in order to defend the cells against the effects of heat shock. Interestingly, however, a moderate heat shock stimulates expression of genes needed for the parasites to develop further into forms that can colonise the salivary glands.

What may help explaining differences between antibiotic activity in vitro and in vivo is that current antibiotic susceptibility tests do not consider the in vivo lung environment. The lung environment contains many factors that may influence bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics. This includes lung epithelial cells, which have been shown to improve the activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Yet, how lung epithelial cells increase aminoglycoside activity is currently unknown. Here, we cultured lung epithelial cells in an in vivo-like model and found that they secrete metabolites that enhance the activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. We found that host cell secretions increased antibiotic uptake through stimulation of bacterial metabolism, which in turn resulted in enhanced activity. Our findings highlight that cross-talk between host and bacterial metabolisms contributes to the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Understanding how the host metabolism influences antibiotic activity may open up therapeutic avenues to exploit host metabolism for improving antibiotic activity and help explaining discrepancies between antibiotic efficacy in vitro and in vivo.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, is a leading cause of antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. In this study, we investigated the influence of the local host microenvironment on antibiotic activity in a vivo-like-dimensional (3-D) lung epithelial cell model.

Using high-throughput sequencing, we have mapped RNA Polymerase II's position in the genome after depletion of termination factors from the nucleus. We found that depletion of Ysh1 and Sen1 cause build up of polymerase directly downstream of coding and non-coding genes, respectively. Depletion of Nrd1 causes an increase in polymerase that is distributed up to 1,000 bases downstream of non-coding genes. The depletion of Nrd1 helped us to identify more than 250 unique termination regions for non-coding RNAs. Within this set of newly identified non-coding termination regions, we are further able to classify them based on sequence motif similarities, suggesting a functional role for different terminator motifs. The role of these factors in transcriptional termination of coding and/or non-coding transcripts can be inferred from the effect of polymerase's position downstream of given termination sites.

While this “survival-only” response is fundamental to all physiological processes, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Many growth factors are potent regulators of cell survival through their ability to bind specific cell surface receptors, which in turn activate specialized enzymes called kinases. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a dual specificity kinase that is known to be involved in cell survival and malignant transformation, and it is able to phosphorylate both lipid and protein substrates. While the PI3K lipid kinase activity has been extensively studied, the functional significance of its protein kinase activity remains unclear. Here we show that PI3K protein kinase activity can directly phosphorylate growth factor receptors on human hematopoietic (blood) cells to promote a “survival-only” response. We further show that the protein kinase activity of PI3K can be hijacked to result in uncontrolled growth factor receptor phosphorylation and the deregulated survival of leukemic cells.

The fidelity of this process, and thus the health of the cell, depends critically on the proper function of proteins that direct transcription. Since hundreds of genes, each specifying a unique RNA transcript, are arranged in tandem along each chromosome, the beginning and end of each gene must be marked in the DNA sequence. Although encoded in DNA, the signal for terminating an RNA transcript is usually recognized in the transcript itself. We examined the genome-wide functional targets of six proteins implicated in transcription termination by identifying transcripts whose structure or abundance is altered by a mutation that compromises the activity of each protein. For a small minority of transcripts, a mutation in any of the six proteins disrupts termination. Much more commonly, a transcript is affected by a mutation in only one or a few of the six proteins, revealing the varying extent to which the proteins cooperate with one another. We discovered affected transcripts that were not known to be controlled by any of the six proteins, including a cohort of genes required for meiosis.","In eukaryotic cells, non-coding RNAs are required for the expression of protein-coding genes. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, initiation of non-coding RNAs (Pol II) appears to be similar to initiation of non-coding RNAs (NNS) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The clinical success of such drugs has been limited by the evolution of acquired resistance to these compounds, which leads to a relapse after initial response to therapy. Current dosing procedures are not designed to optimally delay the emergence of resistance; the identification of such optimal dosing schedules represents an important challenge in clinical cancer research. Here, we design a novel methodology to identify the optimum drug administration strategies that reach this clinical goal. Our model describes the evolutionary dynamics of a tumor cell population during therapy. We consider drug resistance emerging due to a single (epi)genetic alteration and calculate the probability of resistance arising during specific dosing strategies. We then optimize treatment protocols such that the risk of resistance is minimal while considering drug toxicity and side effects as constraints. Since this methodology can be extended to describe situations arising during administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy as well, it can be used to identify optimum drug administration schedules to avoid resistance for any cancer and treatment type.","The discovery of small molecules targeting specific oncogenic pathways in anti-cancer therapy has led to the development of a new class of small molecules that target specific oncogenic pathways.

The disease is caused by species belonging to the Paracoccidioides genus. Once inside the human host, Paracoccidioides must face the host innate immune system, escaping from the cytotoxic capacity of innate immune cells (ROS production and liberation of polypeptide antibiotics). To do so, they express and synthetize superoxide dismutases (SODs). We aimed to identify and characterize the SOD isoforms present in the Paracoccidioides genome. We identified six isoforms, among which we found an increased expression of PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 during the transition-to-yeast process, exposure to oxidative agents and interaction with phagocytic cells. Additionally, we found that PbSOD3 expression might be linked with a pronounced extracellular activity while PbSOD1 and the other isoforms seem more related to intracellular requirements of the fungus. We propose that the defence against endogenous-produced ROS may depend on intracellular Sods (mostly SOD1, but possibly also SOD2, SOD4 and SOD5), but defence against extracellular ROS (produced during host-pathogen interactions) might rely to a greater extent on SOD3, which is endowed with an extracellular activity.","Paracoccidioides are a group of funguses that are capable of defending themselves against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by their host effector cells.

Outbreaks of EVD occur periodically in African countries and can be exported elsewhere, with recent outbreaks including one ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the largest ever in Western Africa in 2013–2016. There is therefore a great need to develop new vaccines and treatments that target ebolaviruses. We examined whether a lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein), predicted to bind to carbohydrates present on the surface of many viruses and thereby interfere with infection, could block ebolavirus infection and be used for prevention and/or treatment of EVD. We found that the protein blocked ebolavirus infection in cell cultures and, moreover, protected a significant proportion of ebolavirus-infected mice from death, even when administered only once before exposure to virus as a preventive.

In adults, this merging of information is optimal: more reliable sensory estimates have more influence (higher weight) in the combined, multisensory estimate. Multisensory integration can result in illusions: if a single visual flash (e.g. a bright disk appearing briefly on a screen) occurs at the same time as two beeps, we sometimes perceive two flashes. This is because auditory information is generally more reliable than vision for judging when things happen; it dominates our audio-visual percept for temporal tasks. Previous work suggests that children don’t combine information from different senses in this adult-like way until around 10 years. To investigate this further, we asked children and adults to report the number of visual flashes or auditory beeps when these were presented simultaneously. Surprisingly, all children used appropriate sensory weights: audition—the more reliable signal—tended to dominate perception, with less weight given to vision. However, children didn’t show the adult-like reduction in uncertainty until around 8–10 years. Before that age, they switched between using only auditory or only visual information on each trial.","Adults combine information from different sensory modalities to estimate object properties such as size, location, and orientation.

In this study, we report that a subset of neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LH) expressing the neuropeptide neurotensin (Nts) is critical for orchestrating sleep-wake responses to such challenges. We show that brief activation of NtsLH neurons in mice evokes immediate arousals from sleep, while their sustained activation increases wake, locomotor activity, and body temperature for several hours. In contrast, when NtsLH neurons are inhibited, mice are neither able to sustain wake in a novel environment nor able to reduce wake during food deprivation.

Neurons encoding these interaural time differences (ITDs) receive an excitatory synaptic input from each ear. They can perform a microsecond computation with excitatory synapses that have millisecond time scale because they are extremely sensitive to the input's “rise time,” the time taken to reach the peak of the synaptic input. Current theories assume that the biophysical properties of the two inputs are identical. We challenge this assumption by showing that the rise times of excitatory synaptic potentials driven by the ipsilateral ear are faster than those driven by the contralateral ear. Further, we present a computational model demonstrating that this disparity in rise times, together with the neurons' sensitivity to excitation's rise time, can endow ITD-encoding with microsecond resolution in the biologically relevant range. Our analysis also resolves a timing mismatch. The difference between contralateral and ipsilateral latencies is substantially larger than the relevant ITD range. We show how the rise time disparity compensates for this mismatch. Generalizing, we suggest that phasic-firing neurons—those that respond to rapidly, but not to slowly, changing stimuli—are selective to the temporal ordering of brief inputs. In a coincidence-detection computation the neuron will respond more robustly when a faster input leads a slower one, even if the inputs are brief and have similar amplitudes.","Low-frequency sound depends on neural computation interaural time differences (ITD), which relies on neurons in the auditory brain stem integrate synaptic inputs delivered ipsi- contralateral auditory pathways start ears. auditory neurons respond selectively to ITD found in the medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO).

We hypothesize that in addition to fungal and oomycete pathogens, the bacterial model plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae also protects itself in the apoplast by secreting inhibitors targeting these apoplastic hydrolases. The genome of P. syringe harbours over 131 genes encoding putative small, non-annotated secreted proteins that have not been characterized previously. Here, we produced and purified 43 of these small proteins and tested them for their ability to inhibit the secreted immune protease C14 of tomato. We discovered a C14 protease inhibitor, coined Cip1, which carries chagasin-like motifs and contributes to virulence. Cip1 also effectively inhibits Pip1, another immune protease of tomato, known to suppress P. syringae infection. Interestingly, Cip1 has a lower affinity for the immune protease Rcr3, explaining why this protein, and PtoDC3000 producing Cip1, is not recognized in tomato plants carrying the Cf-2 resistance gene, which uses Rcr3 as a co-receptor to detect pathogen invasion.","Pseudomonas syringae secretes effectors that manipulate apoplasts to control apoplastic infection in tomato plants.

SHM mutates the regions encoding the antigen-binding site, generating high-affinity antibodies. CSR allows B cells to switch the class of antibody they produce (from IgM to IgA, IgG or IgE), providing novel effector functions. Together, SHM and CSR establish highly specific and pathogen-adapted antibody responses. SHM and CSR are initiated by the recruitment of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) enzyme to antibody genes. Once recruited, AID induces DNA lesions that are processed into mutations during SHM or chromosomal DNA breaks during CSR. These breaks activate multiple DNA repair proteins and are resolved by replacing the IgM gene segments by those encoding IgA, IgG or IgE. AID carries a significant oncogenic potential that needs to be controlled to preserve genome integrity. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that Poly(ADP)ribose polymerase 3 (Parp3), an enzyme recently implicated in DNA repair, contributes to antibody diversification by negatively regulating CSR without affecting SHM. We show that Parp3 facilitates the repair of AID-induced DNA damage and controls AID levels on chromatin. We propose that Parp3 protects antibody genes from sustained AID-dependent DNA damage.","Somatic hypermutation (SHM) class switch recombination (CSR) initiates recruitment of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) immunoglobulin loci subsequent to generation of DNA lesions, differentially processed mutations in SHM double-stranded DNA break intermediates, and differentially processed mutations in SHM single-stranded DNA break intermediates.

We term the first of these mechanisms “network-driven synchrony”, which is characterized by the presence of cycles within the macroscopic network. The second mechanism we term “node-driven”, which is characterized by the ability of an individual node (or nodes) to drive synchrony across the rest of the network, due to the hierarchical structure of the macroscopic network. By applying this framework to routine clinically collected resting state data from people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and from age matched healthy controls, we demonstrate that functional networks of people with epilepsy have a significantly enhanced capacity to synchronize than those of people without epilepsy. This finding suggests a critical role for the connectivity structure of large-scale networks in the tendency to have seizures. Further, by deriving a mathematical equation for the global synchrony of the network, we make it computationally tractable to analyze data in close to real time. This gives our method potential to be used within the clinic as a diagnostic aid for clinicians treating neurological disease.","Neuroscientists have long used graph theory to study complex brain networks inferred from a variety of measures of neural activity, including fMRI, DTI, and MEG EEG.

A key driver of resistance is that drug resistance mutations often persist even in the absence of drugs and despite the fact that resistance mutations are often associated with reduced pathogen replication (“fitness costs”). Such persistence may occur because fitness costs are low, especially if they are compensated by additional mutations in their “genetic background”. Here we assessed the role of fitness-cost and the genetic background for resistance in a real-world epidemiological setting by studying the persistence behavior of transmitted antiretroviral resistance mutations of HIV. This persistence behavior was associated with the predicted fitness cost of a given resistance mutation in the particular genetic background in which it occurred. We found that persistence behavior varied strongly across both mutation types and genetic backgrounds and that persistence was significantly associated with predicted fitness costs. In particular we found that even mutations of the same type tended to persist longer if they occurred in a genetic background where they caused weak fitness costs. Overall our results underline the variability of persistence behavior as well as the important role of fitness costs and the genetic background in the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.","Transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRMs) persist in the absence of drugs for considerable time.

NK cells recognize and kill diseased cells using receptors for self antigens (HLA) that are frequently altered on aberrant cells.

Humans possess from four to 14 KIR receptor genes in their genome, and individual NK cells express a subset of the available KIR genes, generating specialized NK cells that detect alterations in specific HLA proteins. The mechanism of this unusual selective gene activation was recently shown by our group to be controlled by a probabilistic bi-directional promoter switch that turns on a given gene at a pre-determined frequency in the NK cell population. The current study shows that the properties of the switches in terms of the relative activity of forward (on) versus reverse (off) promoter activity is directly correlated with the frequency at which a given gene is expressed within the NK cell population.

These findings may contribute to the development of new chemotherapy strategies against leishmaniasis.","Antimony resistance is a major public health problem caused by the parasite Leishmania guyanensis. Antimony resistance complicates treatment of infections caused by parasite Leishmania guyanensis. Here, we sequenced the genome of Leishmania guyanensis-resistant (SbR) mutants.

This segment was responsible for multidrug resistance associated with the protein aquaglyceroporin 1 (LgAQP1).

MprF, initially discovered in the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, protects bacteria against ‘innate human antibiotics’ such as the defensin peptides. In addition, MprF has recently been implicated in resistance to the new defensin-like antibiotic daptomycin. MprF modifies bacterial membrane lipids with the amino acid l-lysine, which leads to electrostatic repulsion of the membrane-damaging peptides. The molecular mechanism of MprF has remained largely unknown. We demonstrate that MprF represents a novel bifunctional type of enzyme. The N- and C-terminal domains of MprF are both required for mediating antimicrobial peptide resistance but they can be expressed as two separate proteins without loss of function indicating that they represent distinct functional modules. While the C-terminal domain accomplishes lipid lysinylation the N-terminal membrane-embedded domain is required to expose the lysine lipid at the outer surface of the bacterial membrane where it is able to repulse the antimicrobial peptides. These findings unravel the molecular basis of an important bacterial immune evasion mechanism and they may help to employ MprF as a target for new anti-virulence drugs.","Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) is the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections in the United States.

The resurgence of pulmonary tuberculosis in immuno-compromised patients, including HIV-co-infected populations, and increasing spread of drug-resistant Mtb strains are worrying. Given the estimated 2 billion cases of latent Mtb infections and the only partial efficacy of the unique, currently available tuberculosis-vaccine Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) it is necessary to develop improved vaccines. Here, we demonstrate that the host cellular immunity, mediated by CD4+ T lymphocytes, specific to the “PE/PPE” families of mycobacterial antigens, contribute to the protection against Mtb-induced disease. We revealed the fine composition of the PE/PPE-specific T cells by characterizing their effector functions and differentiation status. We previously described a live attenuated mycobacterial strain as a vaccine candidate that is able to induce such CD4+ T cells and which displays particular properties at stimulating the cells of the innate immune system.

Because all humans are related to one another, even if very distantly, all people are inbred to various degrees. From a genetic standpoint, it is well known that inbreeding increases the risk that a child will have a rare recessive genetic disease, but there is also increasing interest in understanding whether inbreeding is a risk factor for more common, complex disorders such as schizophrenia. In this investigation, we used single-nucleotide polymorphism data to quantify the degree to which 9,388 schizophrenia cases and 12,456 controls were inbred, and we tested the hypothesis that people whose genome shows higher evidence of being inbred are at higher risk of having schizophrenia. We estimate that the odds of schizophrenia increase by ∼17% for every 1% increase in inbreeding.

Is this due to random loss in small populations, as is thought to be the case for the extreme genome degradation of intracellular symbionts, or due to selection? And if it is beneficial, is it directly caused by replicating a shorter genome or advantageous loss of the genes themselves? We uncovered that most replicate populations of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 evolved in the laboratory for 1,500 generations lost nearly 10% of their genome. Through reconstructing these deletions, we demonstrated that these losses were indeed beneficial, but the advantage did not scale with length of genome lost, and were even deleterious in alternative environments.

On the other hand, the risk of tuberculosis in patients with good glycemic control (fasting glucose ≤ 130 mg/dl) did not differ significantly from that of individuals without diabetes.There was a linear relationship between fasting plasma glucose at baseline and subsequent risk of tuberculosis.Assuming that these findings imply a causal effect of glycemic control on tuberculosis, 7.5% of incident tuberculosis cases could be prevented if all diabetic patients in the study population achieved good glycemic control.Diabetes control has the potential to complement current tuberculosis control efforts, above and beyond its impact on reducing the burden of non-communicable disease.","Diabetes is a known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) and is increasingly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.

This form of schistosomiasis can also cause dyspareunia, vaginal bleeding, pruritis, and granulomata that appear as tumors in the female genital tract.

Our study reveals CAPER, as the `first’ example of a coregulator nodal integrator which eukaryotes share to orchestrate both nutrient-induced mitochondrial energy metabolism by coactivating ERR-α-Gabpa and stress-induced adaptive metabolic responses via NF- κB/c-Myc; this allows maintenance of carbon-nitrogen balance as well as preservation of life span and reproductive capacity. These metabolic roles for the CAPER coactivator in energy homeostasis are highly conserved and crucial for life span and reproduction in human cells and C. elegans.","In eukaryotes, mitochondria generate ATP, which is required for intimate mito-nuclear communication.

EBV usually infects B lymphocytes and does not produce symptoms in infected individuals, but in rare occasions it infects T or NK lymphocytes and causes severe diseases such as chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) and EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH). We developed mouse models of these two human diseases in which EBV-infected T or NK lymphocytes proliferate in mouse tissues and reproduce human pathologic conditions such as overproduction of small proteins called “cytokines” that produce inflammatory responses in the body. These mouse models are thought to be very useful for the elucidation of the pathogenesis of CAEBV and EBV-HLH as well as for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these diseases. Experiments with the models demonstrated that a subset of lymphocytes called CD4-positive lymphocytes are essential for the proliferation of EBV-infected T and NK cells.

The meningococcal Opa proteins are important in mediating adhesion to and invasion of human tissues, and are important for evasion of the host immune response. They are encoded by a repertoire of 3–4 genomic loci in each meningococcus and exhibit high levels of sequence diversity. Here we analyzed the Opa repertoires of a large, well-characterised, asymptomatically carried meningococcal isolate collection. We found that the Opa repertoires were specific to individual meningococcal genotypes, similar to that observed in isolates from cases of invasive disease. These repertoires exhibited discrete, non-overlapping structure at a population level, and yet low within-repertoire diversity. These data were consistent with the predictions of a mathematical model of strong immune selection, suggesting that the collective immune response of the host population shapes the antigenic diversity of the meningococcal Opa repertoire. This study provides new insights into Opa-mediated meningococcal pathogenesis and the effect of host population immunity on the biodiversity and population structure of bacterial pathogens.

Blood digestion offers challenges to the insect, like managing high concentrations of heme and iron, pro-oxidant and potentially toxic molecules derived from hemoglobin. Mosquitoes and other blood-feeding arthropods have evolved adaptations to overcome this problem, such as the activation of catalase, an antioxidant enzyme that protect tissues against toxic free radicals. Mosquitoes act as important vectors of human diseases because during a blood meal they might also ingest microorganism circulating in our blood, such as dengue and zika virus. The adaptive antioxidant program that protects mosquito tissues against the oxidative challenge imposed by a blood meal might also influences the ability of virus to establish infection and disseminate from the midgut to the salivary glands. We show here that catalase differentially influences the number of infected midguts after mosquitoes were challenged with blood contaminated with virus, being beneficial to Dengue-4 but neutral do Zika, suggesting that redox metabolism may have distinct roles on mosquito vector competence towards different arbovirus.","Aedes aegypti, the causative agent of dengue fever and Zika virus, is a major vector of Aedes aegypti disease.

Based on the static structural information of a remodeler bound on nucleosome, we performed molecular dynamics computer simulations revealing the details of how remodelers slide nucleosomal DNA: the inchworm-like motion of remodelers create small DNA deformations called twist defects, which then spontaneously propagate throughout the nucleosome to induce sliding.

Mutation of the epigenetic regulator CBX2 leads to ovary development in XY embryos, suggesting a critical role for chromatin remodeling during sex determination. However, the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the testis vs. ovary cell-fate decision in the mammalian bipotential gonad are poorly understood. In this study, we developed a genome-wide profile of two histone modifications that play critical roles during development: H3K27me3 (repressive) and H3K4me3 (active). We find that sex-determining genes that are initially co-expressed in XX and XY bipotential gonads are bivalent (marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) prior to sex determination, poised to engage either the testis or ovary fate. Remarkably, after sex determination, repressed genes that promote the alternate fate remain bivalent. We show that stabilization of the testis fate requires CBX2-mediated repression of bivalent ovary-determining genes, which would otherwise block testis development.

During meiosis, chromosomes recombine and segregate twice consecutively to produce haploid daughter cells, which differentiate into gametes. In humans, errors in meiosis are the leading causes of congenital birth defects. In plants, bypassing the meiotic program can lead to production of clonal seeds that retain hybrid traits that otherwise segregate. Thus, understanding the controls of meiosis has major implications for both health and crop improvement. How meiotic gene expression is regulated in multicellular eukaryotes to promote entry into and progression through the meiotic program is poorly understood. Here we identify DUET, a protein essential for male meiosis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, as a regulator of meiotic gene expression. We found that DUET is required for proper expression of JAS and TDM1. These genes function in male meiosis, and regulate spindle organization during meiosis II and cell cycle transitions, respectively. Expression of DUET at the end of prophase coincides with the onset of TDM1 expression, and DUET directly binds TDM1, indicating TDM1 is a direct target of DUET. Our results provide an initial framework for further elucidating the developmental and molecular controls of meiotic gene expression in plants.","Male meiosis is an essential sexual reproduction process in many eukaryotes, including yeast. Meiosis produces haploid cells that are essential for sexual reproduction.

However, factors that ensure proper meiotic gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes are poorly understood. Here, we show that the PHD finger protein essential for male meiosis in the plant Arabidopsis is required for proper microtubule organization and cell cycle transitions in male meiosis. We identify genes that are critical for cell cycle transitions in male meiosis, and show that the PHD finger protein is required for proper microtubule organization and cell cycle transitions in male meiosis. We show that the PHD finger protein binds to the spindleT target, TDM1, and that the T protein is required for proper microtubule organization and cell cycle transitions in male meiosis.",13.685097001763673

One of the key molecules in determining elimination of Leishmania parasites from the infected host cell is the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ). The aim of this study was to investigate which immune response genes are associated with the production of IFN-γ in the context of Leishmania infection. We identified individuals that are high- or low IFN-γ producers upon stimulation of their peripheral blood cells with Leishmania parasites. We then determined the immune gene expression profile of these individuals and we identified a set of genes that are differentially expressed comparing high- and low IFN-γ producers. The expression of these genes was also evaluated in patients with CL and in individuals with a subclinical Leishmania infection (SC). In this setting, the overall pattern of expression of this particular gene combination discriminated the CL patients x from SC individuals. Understanding the initial response to Leishmania may lead to the identification of markers that are associated with development of CL.","Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the parasite Leishmania lesionsiensis, which is transmitted by the bite of infected animals.

Before the cell divides, it first duplicates its genome and separates the chromosomes into the two newly forming daughter cells, a task carried out by a structure called the spindle apparatus, which is composed mostly of long polymers called microtubules. The site of cleavage must occur between the segregating chromosomes—at the spindle equator—to ensure that each cell receives the proper number of chromosomes. In addition to separating the chromosomes, microtubules are also essential for inducing cytokinesis—but how they do this is controversial. For example, the “polar relaxation” hypothesis proposes that the astral microtubules, which radiate outward, cause contractile elements to flow from the polar cortex toward the equator, resulting in furrowing. In contrast, the “equatorial stimulation” hypothesis proposes that the spindle microtubules directly stimulate cleavage exclusively at the equator. Using a novel approach, we demonstrate that both mechanisms are in fact functioning together to recruit actin filaments to the nascent ring, providing redundancy that increases fidelity. Specifically, we were able to mechanically alter the distribution of actin filaments in living, dividing cells by using a microscopic needle to manipulate microtubules while perturbing the cytoskeleton with chemical compounds. Our high-resolution microscopy data advance the understanding of both proposed mechanisms. We also documented a novel, microtubule-based mechanism for transporting actin aggregates to the equatorial cortex. These results help to resolve a long-standing dispute concerning this fundamental cellular process.","The actomyosin filaments newly assembled in the contractile ring of silkworm spermatocytes are powered by the central spindle and/or microtubules, which are essential for induction of cytokinesis.

Here, we present data suggesting that SAMD9 and its paralog, SAMD9L, constitute a critical host barrier against poxvirus infection and pathogenesis. We also discovered some host species-specific difference in SAMD9/SAMD9L and some poxvirus-specific difference in antagonizing SAMD9/SAMD9L, suggesting that these differences serve as a barrier for cross-species poxvirus infection.

Since the clinical presentations of melioidosis are extremely variable and no specific signs or symptoms exist, early laboratory-based diagnosis is highly desirable to start appropriate antibiotics. Routine methods for culture detection of B. pseudomallei are highly specific but take several days for a result, and depending on the clinical sample and other factors, sensitivity can be low. The standard serology test for melioidosis is an indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) based on crude B. pseudomallei antigen preparations. Due to the variable prevalence of background seropositivity in endemic areas and the low diagnostic sensitivity of the IHA upon admission, the test is currently not recommended for the diagnosis of melioidosis, but still widely used.

The genes that regulate development of sex-specific traits may therefore represent novel targets for mosquito control. Here, we examine the effects of silencing the sex-determination gene doublesex (dsx) during development of the human disease vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Targeting of dsx resulted in decreased length of the female wing and proboscis, ovary and reproductive defects, and disruption of olfactory system development. Female lifespan, a critical aspect of mosquito pathogen transmission, was also significantly reduced in adult females following developmental targeting of dsx. The results of this investigation demonstrate that silencing of dsx during A. aegypti development disrupts multiple sex-specific morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits of adult females, a number of which are directly or indirectly linked to mosquito reproduction and pathogen transmission. The results obtained also connect Dsx to development of the mosquito olfactory system, suggesting that A. aegypti will be an excellent system in which to further assess the developmental genetics of sex-specific chemosensation.","Development of the mosquito Aedes aegypti is critical for the transmission of dengue fever and other vector-borne diseases.

Due to the striking genetic monomorphism of African M. ulcerans populations, conventional genetic fingerprinting methods have largely failed to differentiate isolates coming from the same BU endemic area. Here we report a highly discriminatory fingerprinting method for M. ulcerans using a single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic fine-typing technique. This method has enabled us for the first time to identify different M. ulcerans haplotypes within a BU endemic area. Linking the origins of M. ulcerans strains with the patients' residences unveiled the clustering of unique M. ulcerans haplotypes within the Densu river basin of Ghana.

Nrg1, an important factor that blocks hyphal development in the pathogen Candida albicans, activates hyphal growth in S. japonicus, and its expression is counteracted by both quorum sensing and the SAPK pathway.

Here we assess the effects of virus infections on pain sensitivity in mice. Infecting mice with two different viruses, influenza and mouse leukemia virus (MuLV) increased pain sensitivity. Influenza infection caused transient increase in pain sensitivity, which returned to normal levels after infections were cleared. However persistent MuLV infections caused sustained increase in pain sensitivity. Virus-induced pain sensitivity was reduced substantially in mice lacking the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), which degrades the amino acid tryptophan. Moreover a natural compound produced by cells expressing IDO enhanced pain sensitivity when administered to mice lacking IDO genes. Thus cells expressing IDO caused increased pain sensitivity in infected mice. A distinctive cell type expressed IDO selectively and accumulated in spleens of MuLV-infected mice. Transfer of spleen cells from MuLV-infected mice caused increased pain sensitivity in uninfected mice while eliminating specific cells in MuLV-infected mice abolished enhanced pain sensitivity.

Primary emphasis has been placed on characterizing the antibody arm of the immune system, and specifically on antibodies capable of neutralizing the majority of circulating HIV-1 strains. Various experimental techniques can be applied to map the epitope targets of these antibodies, but more recently, the development of computational methods has provided an efficient and accurate alternative for understanding the complex antibody responses to HIV-1 in a given individual.

Typhimurium gastrointestinal tract .","Bacteria belonging to the genus Salmonella are capable of causing long-term chronic systemic infections in specific hosts where they are shed in the feces. These persistently infected individuals include typhoid carriers and they serve as a reservoir for disease transmission. Despite the importance of Salmonella as a human pathogen, relatively little is known about the host immune response to persistent bacterial infections in the context of transmission. We had shown previously in a mouse model of Salmonella infection that mice shedding high levels of Salmonella (>108 bacteria per gram of feces), known as super-shedders, transmit disease to naïve mice. We show here that these super-shedder mice have a unique immune state compared to mice that have lower levels of Salmonella in their gut. The super-shedder immune state is characterized by an active inflammatory immune response with elevated serum IL-6 and high levels of neutrophils in both the gastrointestinal tract and the systemic sites but a dampened adaptive CD4 T helper type1 (TH1) cell response specific to the spleen. Importantly, we show that the blunted adaptive response, as characterized by reduced TH1 cell frequencies and ability to respond to IL-2 and IL-6, is intimately linked to the levels of neutrophils present in the spleen. We go on to show the functional consequences of dampened cytokine responsiveness, as TH1 cells from moderate-shedders are unable to undergo IL-2-mediated expansion when neutrophilia is induced. Additionally, we show that neutrophil control of IL-2 mediated expansion of TH1 cells is independent of infection. In summary, we describe an immune phenotype associated with transmission of a pathogen and a single immune cell type, neutrophils, which control specific aspects of the super-shedder immune state.","Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a pathogen that causes disease in humans and animal hosts. Host-to-host transmission of the pathogen is a striking feature of the disease transmission heterogeneity in host infectiousness. The proposed host population is a group of 20 % infected hosts, termed super-shedders, responsible for 80 % of the disease transmission. In this study, we studied the immune state of super-shedders in a model of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We found that mice infected with super-shedders had a dampened immune response to the gastrointestinal tract spleen and a dampened immune response to the secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, we found that neutrophils blunted the IL-2-mediated proliferation of TH1 cells in spleen-infected super-shedders. We also found that depletion of neutrophils led to an increase in the number of T- bet+ TH1 cells and restored their ability to respond to IL-2. Taken together, these findings suggest that neutrophils blunt the IL-2-mediated proliferation of TH1 cells in spleen-infected super-shedders.",10.563604651162795

It is caused by mutations in the EPM2A or EPM2B genes encoding the laforin carbohydrate-binding phosphatase and the malin E3 ubiquitin ligase. LD is the most common neurodegenerative epilepsy of adolescents. Affected children suffer an ordeal lasting 10 years, consisting of escalating seizures, constant body jerking, particularly frightening epileptic visual hallucinations, and later on dementia. They die of massive convulsion. Brain biopsies reveal accumulation of a starch-like compound, polyglucosan, overtaking dendrites and likely causing the disease, and neurodegeneration. Glycogen synthase (GS), the enzyme that forms normal glycogen, is also responsible for synthesizing these polyglucosans. We reasoned that reducing GS activity might prevent polyglucosan formation. Mice deficient of Epm2a replicate LD and are a standard model. Members of our group generated mice deficient of PTG, a protein involved in activating GS. By breeding LD mice with PTG-lacking mice, we generated LD mice lacking the GS-activating effect of PTG. This resulted in a cure.

These discoveries hold tremendous potential for totally new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. To realize this potential, one important step is to understand the function of the thousands of proteins whose function is currently unknown. One of these proteins of unknown function is human DJ-1, a protein that appears to play a protective role against Parkinson and other neurodegenerative diseases. Here we present a computational approach to the classification by function of DJ-1 and its family members. Eight DJ-1 family members, all with similar 3-D structure, are analyzed. Three different probable functional classes emerge from this analysis on six of the family members, all with a simple calculation.","The protein function sequence and/or 3 - D structure of a protein is often misleading.

Accumulating evidences suggest that miRNAs are pivotal modulators of host–virus interactions, but how virus regulates miRNA accumulation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that NS3 protein encoded by Rice stripe virus (RSV) regulates the processing of several primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by acting as an intermediary to modulate the association of pri-miRNAs and OsDRB1, a key factor of the pri-miRNA processing complex. NS3 increases recruitment of pri-miRNA to the processing complex by its association with OsDRB1 at the sites required for OsDRB1 dimer formation and induces several miRNAs accumulations as well as target genes repression, promoting the sensitivity of rice to RSV infection. Together these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which RSV regulates pri-miRNA processing, leading to enhanced viral infection.","Microbial RNAs (microRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that are processed into primary transcripts and play important roles in plant growth, development, and response to infection microbes.

Surprisingly, we do not understand precisely how these memory cells work: in what way are they better than non-memory (“naïve”) cells, and how do they exert their life-saving functions? It was thought that, following exposure to the relevant microbial antigen, memory cells responded by increasing in number much more quickly than naïve cells and that they achieved this greater abundance by two means: first, by initiating cell division sooner after infection; and, second, by multiplying more rapidly thereafter. Here, we show that neither is true. Memory cells, like naïve cells, begin to divide only after lengthy (2–3 day) delay after virus infection, and their subsequent rate of division is no faster than that of naïve cells. We speculate on the possible evolutionary benefits that might accrue from this lengthy delay before cell division begins.","T cell memory is a cornerstone of protective immunity and is a key element of successful vaccination. However, memory T cells thought to initiate cell division rapidly nave counterparts are thought to confer significant biological advantage to the immune host.

We also show that memory T cells detect and respond to virus infection hours, proliferation begin 3 days after infection, and that cell division is extraordinarily rapid nave memory cells, showing somewhat accelerated accumulation.

It induces diverse effects on the human body and especially on the immune system. The functions of immune cells are positively affected by fever, helping them to fight infection. Fever consists in a physiological elevation of temperature and in inflammation. While the role of inflammatory molecules on HIV-1 replication has been widely studied, little is known about the direct effect of temperature on viral replication. Here, we report that hyperthermia (39.5°C) boosts HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells. In single-cycle infection experiments, hyperthermia increased HIV-1 infection up to 7-fold. This effect was mediated in part by an increased activation of the HIV-1 promoter by the viral protein Tat. Our results also indicate that hyperthermia may help HIV-1 to reactivate from latency. We also show that the Heat Shock Protein Hsp90, which levels are increased at 39.5°C, mediates in a large part the positive effect of hyperthermia on HIV-1 infection.

The currently available drugs are toxic, expensive and have severe side effects. The problem is further compounded by emergence of VL-HIV co-infection and occurence of PKDL after apparent cure. Thus, alternate therapeutic interventions are needed in the absence of vaccines and mounting drug resistance. VL is also characterized by severe depression of cell-mediated immunity that complicates the efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs. Restoration of the dampened immune system coupled with antileishmanial effect would be a rational approach in the quest for antileishmanial drugs.

The peptidoglycan hydrolases responsible for this cleavage often have redundant functions, both revealing their importance and making them difficult to study. Furthermore, such hydrolases must be tightly regulated, due to their potentially lytic nature. We recently demonstrated the interaction between a lytic transglycosylase (Rpf) and an endopeptidase (RipA) at the septum of dividing bacteria. To investigate the role of these two hydrolases, we generated conditional mutants of each and were surprised to find that depletion of ripA resulted in long chains of cells. This phenotype was reversed upon induction of ripA, indicating that cell wall expansion and septum formation can be decoupled from the process of septum resolution. In addition, we present data showing that the combination of Rpf and RipA results in enhanced hydrolysis of peptidoglycan in an in vitro assay, suggesting protein–protein interactions as one potential mechanism of regulation.","The final stage of bacterial cell division requires activity enzymes capable of degrading layers of peptidoglycan connecting recently developed daughter cells.

Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago.

We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas.

Therapies targeting the pathogenic lifestyle of NTHI remain non-existent due to a lack of understanding of host microenvironmental cues and bacterial responses that dictate NTHI persistence. Iron availability influences bacterial virulence traits and biofilm formation; yet, host sequestration of iron serves to restrict bacterial growth. We predicted that fluctuations in availability of iron-containing compounds, typically associated with infection, would impact NTHI pathogenesis. We demonstrated that transient restriction of heme-iron triggered an epigenetic developmental program that enhanced NTHI biofilm architecture, directly influenced by induced morphological changes in bacterial length. Heme-iron restricted bacteria were primed for survival in the mammalian middle ear, due in part to an observed reduction in host inflammation coinciding with a striking reduction in host mucosal epithelial damage, compared to that observed in response to heme-iron replete NTHI. Moreover, transiently restricted NTHI were more invasive of epithelial cells resulting in formation of intracellular bacterial communities. Our findings significantly advance our understanding of how host immune pressure and nutrient availability influence pathogenic behaviors that impact disease severity.","Haemophilus pharyngitis is the most common cause of acute otitis media in the United States.

We found that Haemophilus sequentially depletes heme-iron in heme-iron replete media and that this depletion potentiates biofilm changes 72 hours after infection.
