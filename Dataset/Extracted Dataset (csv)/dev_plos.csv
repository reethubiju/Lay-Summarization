"Functionally analogous enzymes are those that catalyze similar reactions on similar substrates but do not share common ancestry, providing a window on the different structural strategies nature has used to evolve required catalysts. Identification and use of this information to improve reaction classification and computational annotation of enzymes newly discovered in the genome projects would benefit from systematic determination of reaction similarities. Here, we quantified similarity in bond changes for overall reactions and catalytic mechanisms for 95 pairs of functionally analogous enzymes (non-homologous enzymes with identical first three numbers of their EC codes) from the MACiE database. Similarity of overall reactions was computed by comparing the sets of bond changes in the transformations from substrates to products. For similarity of mechanisms, sets of bond changes occurring in each mechanistic step were compared; these similarities were then used to guide global and local alignments of mechanistic steps. Using this metric, only 44% of pairs of functionally analogous enzymes in the dataset had significantly similar overall reactions. For these enzymes, convergence to the same mechanism occurred in 33% of cases, with most pairs having at least one identical mechanistic step. Using our metric, overall reaction similarity serves as an upper bound for mechanistic similarity in functional analogs. For example, the four carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates (EC 4.2.3) show neither significant overall reaction similarity nor significant mechanistic similarity. By contrast, the three carboxylic-ester hydrolases (EC 3.1.1) catalyze overall reactions with identical bond changes and have converged to almost identical mechanisms. The large proportion of enzyme pairs that do not show significant overall reaction similarity (56%) suggests that at least for the functionally analogous enzymes studied here, more stringent criteria could be used to refine definitions of EC sub-subclasses for improved discrimination in their classification of enzyme reactions. The results also indicate that mechanistic convergence of reaction steps is widespread, suggesting that quantitative measurement of mechanistic similarity can inform approaches for functional annotation.
","When species evolve, their genes duplicate and diverge to allow for adaptation of their functional repertoires to the changing environment. In this scenario, unrelated genes can convergently evolve to produce proteins with the same molecular function, termed “functionally analogous.” A quantitative determination of the reaction similarities among functionally analogous enzymes could provide insight about the different structural solutions nature has used to evolve similar catalysts. Bond changes between substrates and products, and between successive reaction intermediates, were used to compare the reactions catalyzed and the mechanisms of catalysis for 95 pairs of functionally analogous enzymes. Less than half of the reactions catalyzed by unrelated enzymes, but defined as similar by the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification, are similar in terms of bond changes, suggesting that this classification often fails to capture quantitative differences between many enzyme reactions. Furthermore, we addressed for the first time whether the chemical mechanisms by which similar overall reactions are achieved in functional analogs are also similar. We conclude that convergence of reaction is often accompanied by convergence of chemical mechanism. These results will be useful for classifying enzymes, guiding functional annotation of newly determined enzyme sequences and structures and for informing the engineering of enzymes with new functions.

"The rate at which a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) can survey for infected cells is a key ingredient of models of vertebrate immune responses to intracellular pathogens. Estimates have been obtained using in vivo cytotoxicity assays in which peptide-pulsed splenocytes are killed by CTL in the spleens of immunised mice. However the spleen is a heterogeneous environment and splenocytes comprise multiple cell types. Are some cell types intrinsically more susceptible to lysis than others? Quantitatively, what impacts are made by the spatial distribution of targets and effectors, and the level of peptide-MHC on the target cell surface? To address these questions we revisited the splenocyte killing assay, using CTL specific for an epitope of influenza virus. We found that at the cell population level T cell targets were killed more rapidly than B cells. Using modeling, quantitative imaging and in vitro killing assays we conclude that this difference in vivo likely reflects different migratory patterns of targets within the spleen and a heterogeneous distribution of CTL, with no detectable difference in the intrinsic susceptibilities of the two populations to lysis. Modeling of the stages involved in the detection and killing of peptide-pulsed targets in vitro revealed that peptide dose influenced the ability of CTL to form conjugates with targets but had no detectable effect on the probability that conjugation resulted in lysis, and that T cell targets took longer to lyse than B cells. We also infer that incomplete killing in vivo of cells pulsed with low doses of peptide may be due to a combination of heterogeneity in peptide uptake and the dissociation, but not internalisation, of peptide-MHC complexes. Our analyses demonstrate how population-averaged parameters in models of immune responses can be dissected to account for both spatial and cellular heterogeneity.
","Measurements of the rates at which a single cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) can survey for infected cells, and kill them upon encounter, are important for constructing predictive models of vertebrate immune responses to intracellular pathogens. The surveillance rate has been estimated previously using combinations of modeling and experiment, making the assumption that CTL and target cells are well-mixed and that all cell types are killed with equal efficiency. In this study we take an iterative approach with theory and experiment to go beyond such models and detail the effects of cellular heterogeneity, the spatial organisation of the tissue within which killing is taking place, and the influence of the level of expression of peptides on the target cell surface. We demonstrate that determining the degree of co-localisation of effector and target cells, and the level of peptide expression on targets, are most important for improving estimates of CTL killing rates. Further, while the probabilities of killing upon conjugation of CTL with T and B cell targets are similar, T cells take substantially longer to kill than B cells, an effect that may be important when CTL numbers are limiting.

"In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by doubling expression of X-linked genes in both sexes, together with X inactivation in females. Up-regulation of the active X chromosome may be controlled by DNA sequence–based and/or epigenetic mechanisms that double the X output potentially in response to autosomal factor(s). To determine whether X expression is adjusted depending on ploidy, we used expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells. While the average X:autosome expression ratio was about 1 in normal diploid cells, this ratio was lower (0.81–0.84) in triploid cells with one active X and higher (1.32–1.4) in triploid cells with two active X's. Thus, overall X-linked gene expression in triploid cells does not strictly respond to an autosomal factor, nor is it adjusted to achieve a perfect balance. The unbalanced X:autosome expression ratios that we observed could contribute to the abnormal phenotypes associated with triploidy. Absolute autosomal expression levels per gene copy were similar in triploid versus diploid cells, indicating no apparent global effect on autosomal expression. In triploid cells with two active X's our data support a basic doubling of X-linked gene expression. However, in triploid cells with a single active X, X-linked gene expression is adjusted upward presumably by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets. Such a mechanism may act on a subset of genes whose expression dosage in relation to autosomal expression may be critical. Indeed, we found that there was a range of individual X-linked gene expression in relation to ploidy and that a small subset (∼7%) of genes had expression levels apparently proportional to the number of autosomal sets.
","Many organisms have a single X chromosome in males and two in females, leading to a chromosome imbalance between autosomes and sex chromosomes and between the sexes. In mammals, this dosage imbalance is adjusted by doubling expression of X-linked genes in both sexes and by silencing one X chromosome in females. We used expression array analyses of human triploid cultures to test X chromosome expression in the presence of three sets of autosomes and address the question of an autosomal counting factor. We found that overall X-linked gene expression is not tripled in the presence of three sets of autosomes. However, in triploid cells with a single active X chromosome, its expression is adjusted upward presumably by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the active X/autosome ratio. Based on the range of individual gene expression we identified a subset of dosage-sensitive genes whose expression is apparently proportional to the ploidy. Our findings are important for understanding the regulation of the X chromosome and the role of ploidy in the balance of gene expression and associated phenotypes.

"The pig parasite Ascaris suum plays and important role in veterinary medicine and represents a suitable model for A. lumbricoides, which infects over 800 million people. In pigs, continued exposure to Ascaris induces immunity at the level of the gut, protecting the host against migrating larvae. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize parasite antigens targeted by this local immune response that may be crucial for parasite invasion and establishment and to evaluate their protective and diagnostic potential.
Pigs were immunized by trickle infection for 30 weeks, challenged with 2,000 eggs at week 32 and euthanized two weeks after challenge. At necropsy, there was a 100% reduction in worms recovered from the intestine and a 97.2% reduction in liver white spots in comparison with challenged non-immune control animals. Antibodies purified from the intestinal mucus or from the supernatant of cultured antibody secreting cells from mesenteric lymph nodes of immune pigs were used to probe L3 extracts to identify antibody targets. This resulted in the recognition of a 12kDa antigen (As12) that is actively shed from infective Ascaris L3. As12 was characterized as a phosphorylcholine-containing glycolipid-like antigen that is highly resistant to different enzymatic and chemical treatments. Vaccinating pigs with an As12 fraction did not induce protective immunity to challenge infection. However, serological analysis using sera or plasma from experimentally infected pigs or naturally infected humans demonstrated that the As12 ELISA was able to detect long-term exposure to Ascaris with a high diagnostic sensitivity (98.4% and 92%, respectively) and specificity (95.5% and 90.0%) in pigs and humans, respectively.
These findings show the presence of a highly stage specific, glycolipid-like component (As12) that is actively secreted by infectious Ascaris larvae and which acts as a major antibody target in infected humans and pigs.
","Roundworms infect millions of humans and pigs throughout the world. The pig roundworm A. suum is a good model for A. lumbricoides infection in humans due to similar host physiology and the close genetic relationship between the worms. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize early larval antigens that are targeted by antibodies at the level of the intestine in immune pigs and to evaluate their protective and diagnostic potential. In order to do so, we generated highly immune pigs by repeatedly infecting them with A. suum for a long time (32 weeks). After necropsy, locally harvested antibodies from the gut were used to screen larval extracts. Hereby one particular antigen, named As12, was detected. It was characterized as a molecule of glycolipid nature that is presented on, and actively secreted from, the surface of infective larvae. Pigs immunized with this antigen are not protected from subsequent challenge infection. Experimentally infected pigs or naturally infected humans do however mount a significant serological antibody response to the antigen. These findings shed light on a glycolipid-like antigen (As12) that is secreted by infectious Ascaris larvae and is targeted by the immune system of infected humans and pigs.

"Deep sequencing was used to discover a novel rhabdovirus (Bas-Congo virus, or BASV) associated with a 2009 outbreak of 3 human cases of acute hemorrhagic fever in Mangala village, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africa. The cases, presenting over a 3-week period, were characterized by abrupt disease onset, high fever, mucosal hemorrhage, and, in two patients, death within 3 days. BASV was detected in an acute serum sample from the lone survivor at a concentration of 1.09×106 RNA copies/mL, and 98.2% of the genome was subsequently de novo assembled from ∼140 million sequence reads. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BASV is highly divergent and shares less than 34% amino acid identity with any other rhabdovirus. High convalescent neutralizing antibody titers of >1∶1000 were detected in the survivor and an asymptomatic nurse directly caring for him, both of whom were health care workers, suggesting the potential for human-to-human transmission of BASV. The natural animal reservoir host or arthropod vector and precise mode of transmission for the virus remain unclear. BASV is an emerging human pathogen associated with acute hemorrhagic fever in Africa.
","We used deep sequencing, a method for generating millions of DNA sequence reads from clinical samples, to discover a novel rhabdovirus (Bas-Congo virus, or BASV) associated with a 2009 outbreak of 3 human cases of acute hemorrhagic fever in Mangala village, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africa. The cases, presenting over a 3-week period, were characterized by abrupt disease onset, high fever, bloody vomiting and diarrhea, and, in two patients, death within 3 days. BASV was present in the blood of the lone survivor at a concentration of over a million copies per milliliter. The genome of BASV, assembled from over 140 million sequence reads, reveals that it is very different from any other rhabdovirus. The lone survivor and a nurse caring for him (with no symptoms), both health care workers, were found to have high levels of antibodies to BASV, indicating that they both had been infected by the virus. Although the source of the virus remains unclear, our study findings suggest that BASV may be spread by human-to-human contact and is an emerging pathogen associated with acute hemorrhagic fever in Africa.

"Cells adjust to hypoxic stress within the tumor microenvironment by downregulating energy-consuming processes including translation. To delineate mechanisms of cellular adaptation to hypoxia, we performed RNA-Seq of normoxic and hypoxic head and neck cancer cells. These data revealed a significant down regulation of genes known to regulate RNA processing and splicing. Exon-level analyses classified > 1,000 mRNAs as alternatively spliced under hypoxia and uncovered a unique retained intron (RI) in the master regulator of translation initiation, EIF2B5. Notably, this intron was expressed in solid tumors in a stage-dependent manner. We investigated the biological consequence of this RI and demonstrate that its inclusion creates a premature termination codon (PTC), that leads to a 65kDa truncated protein isoform that opposes full-length eIF2Bε to inhibit global translation. Furthermore, expression of 65kDa eIF2Bε led to increased survival of head and neck cancer cells under hypoxia, providing evidence that this isoform enables cells to adapt to conditions of low oxygen. Additional work to uncover -cis and -trans regulators of EIF2B5 splicing identified several factors that influence intron retention in EIF2B5: a weak splicing potential at the RI, hypoxia-induced expression and binding of the splicing factor SRSF3, and increased binding of total and phospho-Ser2 RNA polymerase II specifically at the intron retained under hypoxia. Altogether, these data reveal differential splicing as a previously uncharacterized mode of translational control under hypoxia and are supported by a model in which hypoxia-induced changes to cotranscriptional processing lead to selective retention of a PTC-containing intron in EIF2B5.
","Tumor hypoxia is a negative prognostic factor for many solid cancers. Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is largely mediated by widespread changes in gene expression and enables cancer cells to adjust and survive. Recently, alternative splicing has been implicated in this process. To identify biologically impactful hypoxia-responsive isoforms, we took an unbiased approach to deeply sequence RNA of normoxic and hypoxic head and neck cancer cells. This analysis identified >1,000 mRNAs as alternatively spliced under hypoxia, including a significant enrichment of alternatively spliced genes involved in adaptation to hypoxia. Most notably, we discovered a unique retained intron in the translation initiation factor EIF2B5 that creates a premature termination codon. We show that this retained intron leads to a 65kDa truncated isoform that opposes full-length eIF2Bε to inhibit global translation and enhances survival of head and neck cancer cells under hypoxia. Strikingly, this intron and several additional hypoxia-induced retained introns were overexpressed in solid tumors relative to normal tissues. Mechanistically, we propose that intron retention under hypoxia is influenced by changes to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity at weak 3′ splice sites and carry out experimental validation for the retained intron in EIF2B5 to investigate intron retention under hypoxia.

"We report the first systems biology investigation of regulators controlling arterial plaque macrophage transcriptional changes in response to lipid lowering in vivo in two distinct mouse models of atherosclerosis regression. Transcriptome measurements from plaque macrophages from the Reversa mouse were integrated with measurements from an aortic transplant-based mouse model of plaque regression. Functional relevance of the genes detected as differentially expressed in plaque macrophages in response to lipid lowering in vivo was assessed through analysis of gene functional annotations, overlap with in vitro foam cell studies, and overlap of associated eQTLs with human atherosclerosis/CAD risk SNPs. To identify transcription factors that control plaque macrophage responses to lipid lowering in vivo, we used an integrative strategy – leveraging macrophage epigenomic measurements – to detect enrichment of transcription factor binding sites upstream of genes that are differentially expressed in plaque macrophages during regression. The integrated analysis uncovered eight transcription factor binding site elements that were statistically overrepresented within the 5′ regulatory regions of genes that were upregulated in plaque macrophages in the Reversa model under maximal regression conditions and within the 5′ regulatory regions of genes that were upregulated in the aortic transplant model during regression. Of these, the TCF/LEF binding site was present in promoters of upregulated genes related to cell motility, suggesting that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway may be activated in plaque macrophages during regression. We validated this network-based prediction by demonstrating that β-catenin expression is higher in regressing (vs. control group) plaques in both regression models, and we further demonstrated that stimulation of canonical Wnt signaling increases macrophage migration in vitro. These results suggest involvement of canonical Wnt signaling in macrophage emigration from the plaque during lipid lowering-induced regression, and they illustrate the discovery potential of an epigenome-guided, systems approach to understanding atherosclerosis regression.
","Atherosclerosis, a progressive accumulation of lipid-rich plaque within arteries, is an inflammatory disease in which the response of macrophages (a key cell type of the innate immune system) to plasma lipoproteins plays a central role. In humans, the goal of significantly reducing already-established plaque through drug treatments, including statins, remains elusive. In mice, atherosclerosis can be reversed by experimental manipulations that lower circulating lipid levels. A common feature of many regression models is that macrophages transition to a less inflammatory state and emigrate from the plaque. While the molecular regulators that control these responses are largely unknown, we hypothesized that by integrating global measurements of macrophage gene expression in regressing plaques with measurements of the macrophage chromatin landscape, we could identify key molecules that control macrophage responses to the lowering of circulating lipid levels. Our systems biology analysis of plaque macrophages yielded a network in which the Wnt signaling pathway emerged as a candidate upstream regulator. Wnt signaling is known to affect both inflammation and the ability of macrophages to migrate from one location to another, and our targeted validation studies provide evidence that Wnt signaling is increased in plaque macrophages during regression. Our findings both demonstrate the power of a systems approach to uncover candidate regulators of regression and to identify a potential new therapeutic target.

"The stem-cell leukemia (SCL, also known as TAL1) gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is essential for the initiation of primitive and definitive hematopoiesis, erythrocyte and megakarocyte differentiation, angiogenesis, and astrocyte development. Here we report that the zebrafish produces, through an alternative promoter site, a novel truncated scl (tal1) isoform, scl-β, which manifests a temporal and spatial expression distinct from the previously described full-length scl-α. Functional analysis reveals that while scl-α and -β are redundant for the initiation of primitive hematopoiesis, these two isoforms exert distinct functions in the regulation of primitive erythroid differentiation and definitive hematopoietic stem cell specification. We further demonstrate that differences in the protein expression levels of scl-α and -β, by regulating their protein stability, are likely to give rise to their distinct functions. Our findings suggest that hematopoietic cells at different levels of hierarchy are likely governed by a gradient of the Scl protein established through temporal and spatial patterns of expression of the different isoforms.
","Hematopoiesis is the process that generates all the body's blood cells. In vertebrates, hematopoietic development occurs in two phases: a transitory embryonic, or primitive, wave produces only erythrocytes (red blood cells) and myeloid cells; an adult, or definitive, wave gives rise to at least three blood cell lineages, including erythrocytes and two types of immune cells—myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Previous studies have shown that the stem-cell leukemia (SCL) gene is essential for hematopoietic stem cell specification and erythrocyte maturation. Yet how SCL regulates these distinct processes is not fully understood. This study demonstrates that zebrafish produce a smaller isoform of scl, scl-β, that plays an overlapping role with the full-length scl-α in the initiation of primitive hematopoiesis, but possesses distinct functions in regulating primitive erythrocyte maturation and definitive hematopoietic stem cell development. We further show that the distinct functions of scl-α and -β are likely due to differences in their protein expression level through the regulation of protein stability. We postulate that hematopoietic cell development at different levels of hierarchy is governed by a gradient of the Scl protein created by temporal and spatial expression of different scl isoforms.

"Most human somatic cells express insufficient levels of telomerase, which can result in telomere shortening and eventually senescence, both of which are hallmarks of ageing. Homology-directed repair (HDR) is important for maintaining proper telomere function in yeast and mammals. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad52 is required for almost all HDR mechanisms, and telomerase-null cells senesce faster in the absence of Rad52. However, its role in preventing accelerated senescence has been unclear. In this study, we make use of rad52 separation-of-function mutants to find that multiple Rad52-mediated HDR mechanisms are required to delay senescence, including break-induced replication and sister chromatid recombination. In addition, we show that misregulation of histone 3 lysine 56 acetylation, which is known to be defective in sister chromatid recombination, also causes accelerated senescence. We propose a model where Rad52 is needed to repair telomere attrition-induced replication stress.
","Telomeres are essential structures located at the ends of chromosomes. The canonical DNA replication machinery is unable to fully replicate DNA at chromosome ends, causing telomeres to shorten with every round of cell division. This shortening can be counteracted by an enzyme called telomerase, but in most human somatic cells, there is insufficient expression of telomerase to prevent telomere shortening. Cells with critically short telomeres can enter an arrested state known as senescence. Telomere attrition has been identified as a hallmark of human ageing. Homologous recombination proteins are important for proper telomere function in yeast and mammals. Yeast lacking both telomerase and Rad52, required for almost all recombination, exhibits accelerated senescence, yet no apparent increase in the rate of telomere shortening. In this study, we explore the role of Rad52 during senescence by taking advantage of rad52 separation-of-function mutants. We find that Rad52 acts in multiple ways to overcome DNA replication problems at telomeres. Impediments to telomere replication can be dealt with by post-replication repair mechanisms, which use a newly synthesized sister chromatid as a template to replicate past the impediment, while telomere truncations, likely caused by the collapse of replication forks, can be extended by break-induced replication.

"In light of multinational efforts to reduce helminthiasis, we evaluated whether there exist high-risk subpopulations for helminth infection. Such individuals are not only at risk of morbidity, but may be important parasite reservoirs and appropriate targets for disease control interventions.
We followed two longitudinal cohorts in Sichuan, China to determine whether there exist persistent human reservoirs for the water-borne helminth, Schistosoma japonicum, in areas where treatment is ongoing. Participants were tested for S. japonicum infection at enrollment and two follow-up points. All infections were promptly treated with praziquantel. We estimated the ratio of the observed to expected proportion of the population with two consecutive infections at follow-up. The expected proportion was estimated using a prevalence-based model and, as highly exposed individuals may be most likely to be repeatedly infected, a second model that accounted for exposure using a data adaptive, machine learning algorithm. Using the prevalence-based model, there were 1.5 and 5.8 times more individuals with two consecutive infections than expected in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001 in both cohorts). When we accounted for exposure, the ratio was 1.3 (p = 0.013) and 2.1 (p<0.001) in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively.
We found clustering of infections within a limited number of hosts that was not fully explained by host exposure. This suggests some hosts may be particularly susceptible to S. japonicum infection, or that uncured infections persist despite treatment. We propose an explanatory model that suggests that as cercarial exposure declines, so too does the size of the vulnerable subpopulation. In low-prevalence settings, interventions targeting individuals with a history of S. japonicum infection may efficiently advance disease control efforts.
","Approximately 1 billion people are infected with one or more helminthes – a class of parasites that can impair physical, mental and economic development. We are interested in whether there exist groups who are repeatedly infected with helminthes over time in areas where treatment is ongoing. Such individuals may be at risk of morbidity and may also serve as parasite reservoirs, making them appropriate targets for disease control programs. We followed two cohorts in rural Sichuan, China in order to evaluate whether the same individuals were repeatedly infected with the water-borne helminth, Schistosoma japonicum. Each participant was tested for infection at enrollment and two follow-up points – all infections were promptly treated. We conducted detailed interviews to assess exposures to S. japonicum. We found infections repeatedly occurred in a subgroup of individuals and this clustering of infections was only partly explained by differences in exposure. This suggests some individuals may be particularly susceptible to S. japonicum infection. Further exploration of the interplay of exposure and susceptibility suggest that as exposure declines, so too does the fraction of the population vulnerable to infection. Helminth control programs that target people with a history of infection may efficiently reduce helminth infections and morbidity.

"Despite considerable efforts over the last decades, our understanding of leprosy pathogenesis remains limited. The complex interplay between pathogens and hosts has profound effects on host metabolism. To explore the metabolic perturbations associated with leprosy, we analyzed the serum metabolome of leprosy patients. Samples collected from lepromatous and tuberculoid patients before and immediately after the conclusion of multidrug therapy (MDT) were subjected to high-throughput metabolic profiling. Our results show marked metabolic alterations during leprosy that subside at the conclusion of MDT. Pathways showing the highest modulation were related to polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism, with emphasis on anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving omega-3 fatty acids. These results were confirmed by eicosanoid measurements through enzyme-linked immunoassays. Corroborating the repertoire of metabolites altered in sera, metabonomic analysis of skin specimens revealed alterations in the levels of lipids derived from lipase activity, including PUFAs, suggesting a high lipid turnover in highly-infected lesions. Our data suggest that omega-6 and omega-3, PUFA-derived, pro-resolving lipid mediators contribute to reduced tissue damage irrespectively of pathogen burden during leprosy disease. Our results demonstrate the utility of a comprehensive metabonomic approach for identifying potential contributors to disease pathology that may facilitate the development of more targeted treatments for leprosy and other inflammatory diseases.
","Leprosy is caused by a mycobacterium that has a predilection for the skin and nerve cells, and the disease is treated with a combination of antibiotics (multidrug therapy, MDT). Nerve damage caused by the infection may lead to permanent disabilities, and can happen even during MDT and subsequent to patient release. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the leprosy bacillus and humans is mandatory in order to develop new tools for better disease control and management. Aiming to understand more about the effects of leprosy on human metabolism, we analyzed the chemical composition of sera from leprosy patients before and after MDT. Our results show that specific classes of molecules are affected by the infection, and that MDT can partially reverse these effects. In particular, lipids related to polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism and known to play a role in the host's defense mechanisms were highly affected during the disease. A complete understanding of all the steps in this process may open new avenues for leprosy treatment with consequent prevention of neuropathy.

"Maize leafbladeless1 (lbl1) encodes a key component in the trans-acting short-interfering RNA (ta-siRNA) biogenesis pathway. Correlated with a great diversity in ta-siRNAs and the targets they regulate, the phenotypes conditioned by mutants perturbing this small RNA pathway vary extensively across species. Mutations in lbl1 result in severe developmental defects, giving rise to plants with radial, abaxialized leaves. To investigate the basis for this phenotype, we compared the small RNA content between wild-type and lbl1 seedling apices. We show that LBL1 affects the accumulation of small RNAs in all major classes, and reveal unexpected crosstalk between ta-siRNA biogenesis and other small RNA pathways regulating transposons. Interestingly, in contrast to data from other plant species, we found no evidence for the existence of phased siRNAs generated via the one-hit model. Our analysis identified nine TAS loci, all belonging to the conserved TAS3 family. Information from RNA deep sequencing and PARE analyses identified the tasiR-ARFs as the major functional ta-siRNAs in the maize vegetative apex where they regulate expression of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3) homologs. Plants expressing a tasiR-ARF insensitive arf3a transgene recapitulate the phenotype of lbl1, providing direct evidence that deregulation of ARF3 transcription factors underlies the developmental defects of maize ta-siRNA biogenesis mutants. The phenotypes of Arabidopsis and Medicago ta-siRNA mutants, while strikingly different, likewise result from misexpression of the tasiR-ARF target ARF3. Our data indicate that diversity in TAS pathways and their targets cannot fully account for the phenotypic differences conditioned by ta-siRNA biogenesis mutants across plant species. Instead, we propose that divergence in the gene networks downstream of the ARF3 transcription factors or the spatiotemporal pattern during leaf development in which these proteins act constitute key factors underlying the distinct contributions of the ta-siRNA pathway to development in maize, Arabidopsis, and possibly other plant species as well.
","Mutations in maize leafbladeless1 (lbl1) that disrupt ta-siRNA biogenesis give rise to plants with thread-like leaves that have lost top/bottom polarity. We used genomic approaches to identify lbl1-dependent small RNAs and their targets to determine the basis for these polarity defects. This revealed substantial diversity in small RNA pathways across plant species and identified unexpected roles for LBL1 in the regulation of repetitive elements within the maize genome. We further show that only ta-siRNA loci belonging to the TAS3 family function in the maize vegetative apex. The TAS3-derived tasiR-ARFs are the main ta-siRNA active in the apex, and misregulation of their ARF3 targets emerges as the basis for the lbl1 leaf polarity defects. Supporting this, we show that plants expressing arf3a transcripts insensitive to tasiR-ARF-directed cleavage recapitulate the phenotypes observed in lbl1. The TAS3 ta-siRNA pathway, including the regulation of ARF3 genes, is conserved throughout land plant evolution, yet the phenotypes of plants defective for ta-siRNA biogenesis are strikingly different. Our data leads us to propose that divergence in the processes regulated by the ARF3 transcription factors or the spatiotemporal pattern during development in which these proteins act, underlies the diverse developmental contributions of this small RNA pathway across plants.

"There is evidence that biological synapses have a limited number of discrete weight states. Memory storage with such synapses behaves quite differently from synapses with unbounded, continuous weights, as old memories are automatically overwritten by new memories. Consequently, there has been substantial discussion about how this affects learning and storage capacity. In this paper, we calculate the storage capacity of discrete, bounded synapses in terms of Shannon information. We use this to optimize the learning rules and investigate how the maximum information capacity depends on the number of synapses, the number of synaptic states, and the coding sparseness. Below a certain critical number of synapses per neuron (comparable to numbers found in biology), we find that storage is similar to unbounded, continuous synapses. Hence, discrete synapses do not necessarily have lower storage capacity.
","It is believed that the neural basis of learning and memory is change in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Much theoretical work on this topic assumes that the strength, or weight, of a synapse may vary continuously and be unbounded. More recent studies have considered synapses that have a limited number of discrete states. In dynamical models of such synapses, old memories are automatically overwritten by new memories, and it has been previously difficult to optimize performance using standard capacity measures, for stronger learning typically implies faster forgetting. Here, we propose an information theoretic measure of storage capacity of such forgetting systems, and use this to optimize the learning rules. We find that for parameters comparable to those found in biology, capacity of discrete synapses is similar to that of unbounded, continuous synapses, provided the number of synapses per neuron is limited. Our findings are relevant for experiments investigating the precise nature of synaptic changes during learning, and also pave a path for further work on building biologically realistic memory models.

"Previously, we investigated the role of the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) virulence genes NSs and NSm in mosquitoes and demonstrated that deletion of NSm significantly reduced the infection, dissemination, and transmission rates of RVFV in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The specific aim of this study was to further characterize midgut infection and escape barriers of RVFV in Ae. aegypti infected with reverse genetics-generated wild type RVFV (rRVF-wt) or RVFV lacking the NSm virulence gene (rRVF-ΔNSm) by examining sagittal sections of infected mosquitoes for viral antigen at various time points post-infection.
Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were fed an infectious blood meal containing either rRVF-wt or rRVF-ΔNSm. On days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 post-infection, mosquitoes from each experimental group were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and examined for RVFV antigen by immunofluorescence assay. Remaining mosquitoes at day 14 were assayed for infection, dissemination, and transmission. Disseminated infections were observed in mosquitoes as early as three days post infection for both virus strains. However, infection rates for rRVF-ΔNSm were statistically significantly less than for rRVF-wt. Posterior midgut infections in mosquitoes infected with rRVF-wt were extensive, whereas midgut infections of mosquitoes infected with rRVF-ΔNSm were confined to one or a few small foci.
Deletion of NSm resulted in the reduced ability of RVFV to enter, replicate, and disseminate from the midgut epithelial cells. NSm appears to have a functional role in the vector competence of mosquitoes for RVFV at the level of the midgut barrier.
","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne virus endemic to Africa. Outbreaks of RVFV have resulted in devastating morbidity and mortality in livestock and humans. A novel RVFV vaccine strain has been developed in which two virulence genes, NSs and NSm, have been deleted from the RVFV genome. Previously, we demonstrated that deletion of NSm also significantly reduced the ability of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to transmit RVFV. The objective of this study was to track the spread (dissemination) of wild type RVFV (rRVF-wt) and RVFV lacking the NSm virulence gene (rRVF-ΔNSm) through different tissues in the mosquito body over time by staining lengthwise slices of infected mosquitoes with fluorescent antibody specific to RVFV. We found that midgut infections in mosquitoes exposed to rRVF-wt were extensive, whereas midgut infections in mosquitoes infected with rRVF-ΔNSm were confined to only one or a few small foci. Our data provide supporting evidence that the NSm virulence gene has a functional role in mosquitoes by helping RVFV establish an infection in, and escape from, the midgut.

"The present study aimed to evaluate a hypothetical Leishmania amastigote-specific protein (LiHyp1), previously identified by an immunoproteomic approach performed in Leishmania infantum, which showed homology to the super-oxygenase gene family, attempting to select a new candidate antigen for specific serodiagnosis, as well as to compose a vaccine against VL.
The LiHyp1 DNA sequence was cloned; the recombinant protein (rLiHyp1) was purified and evaluated for its antigenicity and immunogenicity. The rLiHyp1 protein was recognized by antibodies from sera of asymptomatic and symptomatic animals with canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL), but presented no cross-reactivity with sera of dogs vaccinated with Leish-Tec, a Brazilian commercial vaccine; with Chagas' disease or healthy animals. In addition, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of rLiHyp1 plus saponin was evaluated in BALB/c mice challenged subcutaneously with virulent L. infantum promastigotes. rLiHyp1 plus saponin vaccinated mice showed a high and specific production of IFN-γ, IL-12, and GM-CSF after in vitro stimulation with the recombinant protein. Immunized and infected mice, as compared to the control groups (saline and saponin), showed significant reductions in the number of parasites found in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and in the paws' draining lymph nodes. Protection was associated with an IL-12-dependent production of IFN-γ, produced mainly by CD4 T cells. In these mice, a decrease in the parasite-mediated IL-4 and IL-10 response could also be observed.
The present study showed that this Leishmania oxygenase amastigote-specific protein can be used for a more sensitive and specific serodiagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic CVL and, when combined with a Th1-type adjuvant, can also be employ as a candidate antigen to develop vaccines against VL.
","Life-long immunity to leishmaniasis in recovered patients has inspired the development of vaccines against disease. The present study aimed to evaluate a non-described hypothetical Leishmania amastigote-specific protein, identified by an immunoproteomic approach in L. infantum, attempting to select a new candidate antigen for specific serodiagnosis and a vaccine against visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The recombinant protein (rLiHyp1) was recognized by antibodies from sera of asymptomatic and symptomatic canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL), but presented no cross-reactivity with sera of vaccinated dogs, those with Chagas' disease or healthy animals. In addition, the rLiHyp1 plus saponin was able to induce a Th1 response, which was based on the production of high levels of IFN-γ, IL-12, and GM-CSF after in vitro stimulation in BALB/c mice. The protective efficacy of rLiHyp1 plus saponin was evaluated in mice challenged with L. infantum promastigotes. Challenged and vaccinated mice showed significant reductions in the number of parasites in all evaluated organs, and the protection was associated with a Th1-type response. Therefore, the present study reveals a new potential candidate for the improvement of serodiagnosis of CVL, as well as an effective vaccine candidate against VL.

"Chromatin insulators are genetic elements implicated in the organization of chromatin and the regulation of transcription. In Drosophila, different insulator types were characterized by their locus-specific composition of insulator proteins and co-factors. Insulators mediate specific long-range DNA contacts required for the three dimensional organization of the interphase nucleus and for transcription regulation, but the mechanisms underlying the formation of these contacts is currently unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular associations between different components of insulator complexes (BEAF32, CP190 and Chromator) by biochemical and biophysical means, and develop a novel single-molecule assay to determine what factors are necessary and essential for the formation of long-range DNA interactions. We show that BEAF32 is able to bind DNA specifically and with high affinity, but not to bridge long-range interactions (LRI). In contrast, we show that CP190 and Chromator are able to mediate LRI between specifically-bound BEAF32 nucleoprotein complexes in vitro. This ability of CP190 and Chromator to establish LRI requires specific contacts between BEAF32 and their C-terminal domains, and dimerization through their N-terminal domains. In particular, the BTB/POZ domains of CP190 form a strict homodimer, and its C-terminal domain interacts with several insulator binding proteins. We propose a general model for insulator function in which BEAF32/dCTCF/Su(HW) provide DNA specificity (first layer proteins) whereas CP190/Chromator are responsible for the physical interactions required for long-range contacts (second layer). This network of organized, multi-layer interactions could explain the different activities of insulators as chromatin barriers, enhancer blockers, and transcriptional regulators, and suggest a general mechanism for how insulators may shape the organization of higher-order chromatin during cell division.

"Epigenetic gene silencing plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and contributes to organismal development and cell fate acquisition in eukaryotes. In fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, heterochromatin-associated gene silencing is known to be mediated by RNA processing pathways including RNA interference (RNAi) and a 3’-5’ exoribonuclease complex, the exosome. Here, we report a new RNA-processing pathway that contributes to epigenetic gene silencing and assembly of heterochromatin mediated by 5’-3’ exoribonuclease Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2. Dhp1 mutation causes defective gene silencing both at peri-centromeric regions and at the silent mating type locus. Intriguingly, mutation in either of the two well-characterized Dhp1-interacting proteins, the Din1 pyrophosphohydrolase or the Rhn1 transcription termination factor, does not result in silencing defects at the main heterochromatic regions. We demonstrate that Dhp1 interacts with heterochromatic factors and is essential in the sequential steps of establishing silencing in a manner independent of both RNAi and the exosome. Genomic and genetic analyses suggest that Dhp1 is involved in post-transcriptional silencing of repetitive regions through its RNA processing activity. The results describe the unexpected role of Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2 in chromatin-based silencing and elucidate how various RNA-processing pathways, acting together or independently, contribute to epigenetic regulation of the eukaryotic genome.
","Epigenetic mechanisms regulate when, where, and how an organism uses the genetic information stored in its genome. They are essential to many cellular processes, such as the regulation of gene expression, genome organization, and cell-fate determination. They also govern growth, development, and ultimately human health. Heterochromatin constitutes silenced chromatic domains, in which gene silencing occurs through epigenetic mechanisms. RNA processing pathways, such as RNA interference (RNAi) and the exosome, are known to mediate the silencing of genes via degradation of unwanted or aberrant transcripts. In this study, we describe a new RNA processing mechanism in epigenetic silencing using fission yeast, a premier model for studying these processes. With genetic, cell biology, and genomic approaches, we uncovered a previously unrecognized function of Dhp1, a highly conserved 5’-3’ exoribonuclease and ortholog of budding yeast Rat1 and metazoan Xrn2. We show that Dhp1 mediates a novel RNA processing mechanism in epigenetic silencing which occurs independently of both RNAi and the exosome. Our results clarify how multiple RNA processing pathways are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and chromatin organization.

"Neuraminidase Inhibitors (NI) are currently the most effective drugs against influenza. Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern. To assess the danger of NI resistance, a number of studies have reported the fraction of treated patients from which resistant strains could be isolated. Unfortunately, those results strongly depend on the details of the experimental protocol. Additionally, knowing the fraction of patients harboring resistance is not too useful by itself. Instead, we want to know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on epidemiological data. Instead, we combine data from influenza infections of human volunteers with a mathematical framework that allows estimation of the parameters that govern the initial generation and subsequent spread of resistance. We show how these parameters are influenced by changes in drug efficacy, timing of treatment, fitness of the resistant strain, and details of virus and immune system dynamics. Our study provides estimates for parameters that can be directly used in mathematical and computational models to study how NI usage might lead to the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. We find that the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the fraction of resistant cases reported. However, we also show that the results depend strongly on the details of the within-host dynamics of influenza infections, and most importantly, the role the immune system plays. Better knowledge of the quantitative dynamics of the immune response during influenza infections will be crucial to further improve the results.

"Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease causing huge economic losses worldwide. Currently no effective immunotherapy for Brucellosis or any biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy is available. Treatment is ineffective and animals remain carrier lifelong. S19 and RB51 are live attenuated vaccine strains of Brucella abortus. However, S19 induces only antibody, ineffective for intracellular pathogen. RB51 induces cell mediated immunity (CMI) but it is Rifampicin resistant. Both organisms are secreted in milk and can infect humans and cause abortions in animals. Phage lysed bacteria (lysates) retain maximum immunogenicity as opposed to killing by heat or chemicals. We report here the successful immunotherapy of bovine Brucellosis by phage lysates of RB51 (RL) and S19 (SL). The SL induced strong antibody response and RL stimulated CMI. In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from RL immunized cattle induced interferon gamma production. A single subcutaneous dose of 2 ml of cocktail lysate (both RL and SL), eliminated live virulent Brucella from Brucellosis affected cattle with plasma level of Brucella specific 223 bp amplicon undetectable by RT-PCR and blood negative for live Brucella by culture in 3 months post-immunization. This is the first report on minimally invasive monitoring of the efficacy of antibacterial therapy employing plasma RNA specific for live bacteria as a biomarker as well as on the use of RB51 phage lysate for successful immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle.
","We report here a novel immunotherapy for cost effective and simple treatment of Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease of global importance. The two main novelties of this work which have important implications are the following: Plasma RNA (specific to Brucella abortus in this case) has been used as a biomarker for the first time to successfully monitor the efficacy of an antibacterial therapy (in this case, immunotherapy of brucellosis). There is no published report of such a biomarker for monitoring the therapy in Brucellosis or any other bacterial infection. Bacterial counts in spleen and other organs before and after phage therapy (after sacrificing) have been used in mice. However, this is not applicable in cattle and humans. Therefore, this novel application of a specific biomarker for periodic minimally invasive and non destructive monitoring of the efficacy of antibacterial therapy could be very useful in Medicine. The phage lysate of RB51 strain of Brucella abortus has been successfully used for immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle for the first time. Although S19 lysate has been used earlier in mice for prophylaxis, it induces only antibody and not cell mediated immune response which is essential for protection against intracellular pathogens like Brucella.

"The 5′-cap structure is a distinct feature of eukaryotic mRNAs, and eukaryotic viruses generally modify the 5′-end of viral RNAs to mimic cellular mRNA structure, which is important for RNA stability, protein translation and viral immune escape. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes two S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTase) which sequentially methylate the RNA cap at guanosine-N7 and ribose 2′-O positions, catalyzed by nsp14 N7-MTase and nsp16 2′-O-MTase, respectively. A unique feature for SARS-CoV is that nsp16 requires non-structural protein nsp10 as a stimulatory factor to execute its MTase activity. Here we report the biochemical characterization of SARS-CoV 2′-O-MTase and the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex bound with methyl donor SAM. We found that SARS-CoV nsp16 MTase methylated m7GpppA-RNA but not m7GpppG-RNA, which is in contrast with nsp14 MTase that functions in a sequence-independent manner. We demonstrated that nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind both m7GpppA-RNA substrate and SAM cofactor. Structural analysis revealed that nsp16 possesses the canonical scaffold of MTase and associates with nsp10 at 1∶1 ratio. The structure of the nsp16/nsp10 interaction interface shows that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the substrate RNA-binding groove of nsp16, consistent with the findings in biochemical assays. These results suggest that nsp16/nsp10 interface may represent a better drug target than the viral MTase active site for developing highly specific anti-coronavirus drugs.
","The distinctive feature of eukaryotic mRNAs is the presence of methylated cap structure that is required for mRNA stability and protein translation. As all viruses employ cellular ribosomes for protein translation, most cytoplasmically replicating eukaryotic viruses including coronaviruses have evolved strategies to cap their RNAs. It was shown very recently that ribose 2′-O-methylation in the cap structure of viral RNAs plays an important role in viral escape from innate immune recognition. The 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) encoded by SARS coronavirus is composed of two subunits, the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10, which is different from all other known 2′-O-MTases that are partner-independent. Here we show that the role of nsp10 is to promote nsp16 to bind capped RNA substrate and the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). We solved the crystal structure of the nsp16/nsp10/SAM complex, and the structural analysis revealed that the details of the inter-molecular interactions and indicated that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the capped RNA-binding groove. The interaction interface of nsp16/nsp10 is unique for coronaviruses and thus may provide an attractive target for developing specific antiviral drugs for control of coronaviruses including the deadly SARS coronavirus.

"The peptidoglycan (PG) sacculus is composed of long glycan strands cross-linked together by short peptides forming a covalently closed meshwork that protects the bacterial cell from osmotic lysis and specifies its shape. PG hydrolases play essential roles in remodeling this three-dimensional network during growth and division but how these autolytic enzymes are regulated remains poorly understood. The FtsEX ABC transporter-like complex has emerged as a broadly conserved regulatory module in controlling cell wall hydrolases in diverse bacterial species. In most characterized examples, this complex regulates distinct PG hydrolases involved in cell division and is intimately associated with the cytokinetic machinery called the divisome. However, in the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis the FtsEX complex is required for cell wall elongation where it regulates the PG hydrolase CwlO that acts along the lateral cell wall. To investigate whether additional factors are required for FtsEX function outside the divisome, we performed a synthetic lethal screen taking advantage of the conditional essentiality of CwlO. This screen identified two uncharacterized factors (SweD and SweC) that are required for CwlO activity. We demonstrate that these proteins reside in a membrane complex with FtsX and that amino acid substitutions in residues adjacent to the ATPase domain of FtsE partially bypass the requirement for them. Collectively our data indicate that SweD and SweC function as essential co-factors of FtsEX in controlling CwlO during cell wall elongation. We propose that factors analogous to SweDC function to support FtsEX activity outside the divisome in other bacteria.
","Bacterial growth and division require the synthesis and remodeling of the cell wall exoskeleton. To prevent lethal breaches in this protective layer, peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases that remodel the cell wall must be carefully regulated but the mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. The noncanonical ABC transporter FtsEX has emerged as a broadly conserved regulator of PG hydrolases. In most characterized examples, FtsEX is integrated into the division machinery where it controls cell wall cleavage during cytokinesis. By contrast, in Bacillus subtilis the FtsEX complex functions in cell wall elongation. Here, we report the identification of two previously uncharacterized proteins (SweD and SweC) that function as essential co-factors of FtsEX in controlling PG hydrolase activity along the lateral cell wall. Homologs of SweD and SweC are found in a subset of firmicutes. We propose that these and analogous factors enable FtsEX to function outside the divisome to control cell wall elongation hydrolases.

"A powerful way of gaining insight into biological systems is by creating a nonlinear differential equation model, which usually contains many unknown parameters. Such a model is called structurally identifiable if it is possible to determine the values of its parameters from measurements of the model outputs. Structural identifiability is a prerequisite for parameter estimation, and should be assessed before exploiting a model. However, this analysis is seldom performed due to the high computational cost involved in the necessary symbolic calculations, which quickly becomes prohibitive as the problem size increases. In this paper we show how to analyse the structural identifiability of a very general class of nonlinear models by extending methods originally developed for studying observability. We present results about models whose identifiability had not been previously determined, report unidentifiabilities that had not been found before, and show how to modify those unidentifiable models to make them identifiable. This method helps prevent problems caused by lack of identifiability analysis, which can compromise the success of tasks such as experiment design, parameter estimation, and model-based optimization. The procedure is called STRIKE-GOLDD (STRuctural Identifiability taKen as Extended-Generalized Observability with Lie Derivatives and Decomposition), and it is implemented in a MATLAB toolbox which is available as open source software. The broad applicability of this approach facilitates the analysis of the increasingly complex models used in systems biology and other areas.
","Advances in computing power have facilitated the development of increasingly larger dynamic models of biological processes, which usually have many unknown parameters. Often times, such models contain parameters that are structurally unidentifiable, i.e., they cannot be uniquely determined from experiments. Any parameter estimation algorithm will fail when trying to estimate unidentifiable parameters, leading to waste of resources and possibly wrong model predictions. Hence, it is essential to assess structural identifiability before exploiting a model. However, performing such analysis can be hard, especially as models become increasingly complicated. To address this challenge, we developed a methodology for structural identifiability analysis that aims at generality—it can handle any analytic model written as a set of ordinary differential equations—and computational efficiency—it includes features that facilitate the analysis of large systems. We provide an implementation of the methodology as a MATLAB toolbox called STRIKE-GOLDD. We illustrate its applicability to systems biology models of genetic, signalling, metabolic, and pharmacokinetic networks, showing which of them are unidentifiable and how they can be made identifiable.

"Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare pediatric cholangiopathy characterized by fibrosclerosing obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventual liver failure. The etiology of BA remains unknown, although environmental, inflammatory, infectious, and genetic risk factors have been proposed. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a European-American cohort of 343 isolated BA patients and 1716 controls to identify genetic loci associated with BA. A second GWAS was performed in an independent European-American cohort of 156 patients with BA and other extrahepatic anomalies and 212 controls to confirm the identified candidate BA-associated SNPs. Meta-analysis revealed three genome-wide significant BA-associated SNPs on 2p16.1 (rs10865291, rs6761893, and rs727878; P < 5 ×10−8), located within the fifth intron of the EFEMP1 gene, which encodes a secreted extracellular protein implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell proliferation, and organogenesis. RNA expression analysis showed an increase in EFEMP1 transcripts from human liver specimens isolated from patients with either BA or other cholestatic diseases when compared to normal control liver samples. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that EFEMP1 is expressed in cholangiocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in liver specimens from patients with BA and other cholestatic diseases, but it is absent from cholangiocytes in normal control liver samples. Efemp1 transcripts had higher expression in cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts as compared with other cell types in normal rat liver. The identification of a novel BA-associated locus, and implication of EFEMP1 as a new BA candidate susceptibility gene, could provide new insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying this severe pediatric disorder.
","The etiology of biliary atresia (BA) is unknown and likely complex. Environmental, infectious, and genetic risk factors have all been proposed, and the leading hypothesis in the field is that a combination of these factors is responsible for disease manifestation. To identify susceptibility loci for BA, we performed a genome wide association study on two groups of BA patients (one composed of patients with isolated BA (n = 343) and one of patients with BA and other extrahepatic anomalies (n = 156)) and genetically matched controls. We detected a set of SNPs within the EFEMP1 gene associated with BA in both cohorts. We further showed by immunohistochemistry that EFEMP1 protein was expressed in cholangiocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in BA livers, and that EFEMP1 RNA expression levels were elevated in both BA and other cholestatic disease livers. These findings suggest that EFEMP1 should be considered as a new candidate susceptibility gene for BA.

"Current efforts to control human soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections involve the periodic mass treatment of people, particularly children, in all endemic areas, using benzimidazole and imidothiazole drugs. Given the fact that high levels of resistance have developed to these same drugs in roundworms of livestock, there is a need to monitor drug efficacy in human STHs. The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), in which faecal egg output is measured pre- and post-drug treatment, is presently under examination by WHO as a means of detecting the emergence of resistance. We have examined the potential impact of density dependent fecundity on FECRT data. Recent evidence with the canine hookworm indicates that the density dependent egg production phenomenon shows dynamic properties in response to drug treatment. This will impact on measurements of drug efficacy, and hence drug resistance. It is likely that the female worms that survive a FECRT drug treatment in some human cases will respond to the relaxation of density dependent constraints on egg production by increasing their egg output significantly compared to their pre-treatment levels. These cases will therefore underestimate drug efficacy in the FECRT. The degree of underestimation will depend on the ability of the worms within particular hosts to increase their egg output, which will in turn depend on the extent to which their egg output is constrained prior to the drug treatment. As worms within different human cases will likely be present at quite different densities prior to a proposed FECRT, there is potential for the effects of this phenomenon on drug efficacy measurements to vary considerably within any group of potential FECRT candidates. Measurement of relative drug efficacy may be improved by attempting to ensure a consistent degree of underestimation in groups of people involved in separate FECRTs. This may be partly achieved by omission of cases with the heaviest infections from a FECRT, as these cases may have the greatest potential to increase their egg output upon removal of density dependent constraints. The potential impact of worm reproductive biology on the utility of the FECRT as a resistance detection tool highlights the need to develop new drug resistance monitoring methods which examine either direct drug effects on isolated worms with in vitro phenotypic assays, or changes in worm genotypes.
","Current efforts to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in humans in endemic countries involve the mass administration of drugs. The use of these same drugs for many years to control livestock nematodes has resulted in the emergence of significant levels of resistance. Hence, there is a need to manage the use of drugs against human STHs in order to reduce the likelihood of resistance developing. An important component of managing drug use will be an ability to detect drug resistance should it emerge. WHO and the World Bank are presently supporting initiatives to develop tools for detecting drug resistance in human STHs. The tool to be assessed in the short term is the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). We have examined literature on an aspect of worm reproductive biology with potential to impact significantly on the FECRT. We describe the potential effects that density dependent egg production by female hookworms may have on interpretation of FECRT data. This study highlights a potential weakness in reliance on the FECRT for assessment of drug resistance in human hookworms, hence emphasising the need to develop more advanced worm bioassay and molecular methods.

"The pseudoautosomal region (PAR) is a short region of homology between the mammalian X and Y chromosomes, which has undergone rapid evolution. A crossover in the PAR is essential for the proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in male meiosis, and PAR deletion results in male sterility. This leads the human PAR with the obligatory crossover, PAR1, to having an exceptionally high male crossover rate, which is 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average. However, the mechanism by which this obligatory crossover occurs remains unknown, as does the fine-scale positioning of crossovers across this region. Recent research in mice has suggested that crossovers in PAR may be mediated independently of the protein PRDM9, which localises virtually all crossovers in the autosomes. To investigate recombination in this region, we construct the most fine-scale genetic map containing directly observed crossovers to date using African-American pedigrees. We leverage recombination rates inferred from the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium in human populations and investigate the signatures of DNA evolution due to recombination. Further, we identify direct PRDM9 binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells. Using these independent lines of evidence, we show that, in contrast with mouse, PRDM9 does localise peaks of recombination in the human PAR1. We find that recombination is a far more rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1 than it is on the autosomes. We also show that PAR1 hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations. Finally, we find evidence that PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between human and chimpanzee, with no evidence of sharing among the hottest hotspots. We anticipate that the genetic maps built and validated in this work will aid research on this vital and fascinating region of the genome.
","Recombination is a fundamental biological process, which shuffles genes between pairs of chromosomes during the production of eggs and sperm. After shuffling, the chromosomes consist of alternating sequences of genes from each parent, where the switches are the result of ‘crossovers’. Recombination is essential for eggs and sperm to receive the correct number of chromosomes, failure in which is an important cause of miscarriage, birth defects and mental retardation. Males have the particular challenge of recombining between the X and Y chromosomes. Unlike the other 22 chromosome pairs, the X and Y chromosomes do not match up, except for a small special region called PAR1, which must host a crossover. We investigate recombination in PAR1 by building a ‘map’ of where it occurs in African-American families. We use a variety of approaches, both analytical and experimental, to demonstrate the role of a protein called PRDM9 in marking crossovers in this region. PRDM9 has previously been shown to position crossovers on the other chromosomes, but a role in PAR1 was unexpected based on research in mice. We also show that the recombination map has changed in the evolutionary history of PAR1, both among human populations, and between human and chimpanzee.

"Ultraconserved elements have been suggested to retain extended perfect sequence identity between the human, mouse, and rat genomes due to essential functional properties. To investigate the necessities of these elements in vivo, we removed four noncoding ultraconserved elements (ranging in length from 222 to 731 base pairs) from the mouse genome. To maximize the likelihood of observing a phenotype, we chose to delete elements that function as enhancers in a mouse transgenic assay and that are near genes that exhibit marked phenotypes both when completely inactivated in the mouse and when their expression is altered due to other genomic modifications. Remarkably, all four resulting lines of mice lacking these ultraconserved elements were viable and fertile, and failed to reveal any critical abnormalities when assayed for a variety of phenotypes including growth, longevity, pathology, and metabolism. In addition, more targeted screens, informed by the abnormalities observed in mice in which genes in proximity to the investigated elements had been altered, also failed to reveal notable abnormalities. These results, while not inclusive of all the possible phenotypic impact of the deleted sequences, indicate that extreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucial functions required for viability.
","It is widely believed that the most evolutionarily conserved DNA sequences in the human genome have been preserved because of their functional importance and that their removal would thus have a devastating effect on the organism. To ascertain this we removed from the mouse genome four ultraconserved elements—sequences of 200 base pairs or longer that are 100% identical among human, mouse, and rat. To our surprise, we found that the mice lacking these elements are viable, fertile, and show no apparent abnormalities. This completely unexpected finding indicates that extreme levels of DNA sequence conservation are not necessarily indicative of an indispensable functional nature.

"Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), a highly pathogenic zoonotic virus, poses serious public health, ecological and potential bioterrorism threats. Currently no specific therapy or vaccine is available. Virus entry is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. However, current knowledge of the ZEBOV entry mechanism is limited. While it is known that ZEBOV enters cells through endocytosis, which of the cellular endocytic mechanisms used remains unclear. Previous studies have produced differing outcomes, indicating potential involvement of multiple routes but many of these studies were performed using noninfectious surrogate systems such as pseudotyped retroviral particles, which may not accurately recapitulate the entry characteristics of the morphologically distinct wild type virus. Here we used replication-competent infectious ZEBOV as well as morphologically similar virus-like particles in specific infection and entry assays to demonstrate that in HEK293T and Vero cells internalization of ZEBOV is independent of clathrin, caveolae, and dynamin. Instead the uptake mechanism has features of macropinocytosis. The binding of virus to cells appears to directly stimulate fluid phase uptake as well as localized actin polymerization. Inhibition of key regulators of macropinocytosis including Pak1 and CtBP/BARS as well as treatment with the drug EIPA, which affects macropinosome formation, resulted in significant reduction in ZEBOV entry and infection. It is also shown that following internalization, the virus enters the endolysosomal pathway and is trafficked through early and late endosomes, but the exact site of membrane fusion and nucleocapsid penetration in the cytoplasm remains unclear. This study identifies the route for ZEBOV entry and identifies the key cellular factors required for the uptake of this filamentous virus. The findings greatly expand our understanding of the ZEBOV entry mechanism that can be applied to development of new therapeutics as well as provide potential insight into the trafficking and entry mechanism of other filoviruses.
","Filoviruses, including Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), are among the most pathogenic viruses known. Our understanding of how these viruses enter into host cells is very limited. A deeper understanding of this process would enable the design of better targeted antiviral therapies. This study defines in detail, key steps of ZEBOV cellular uptake and trafficking into cells using wild type virus as well as the host factors that are responsible for permitting virus entry into cells. Our data indicated that the primary mechanism of ZEBOV uptake is a macropinocytosis-like process that delivers the virus to early endosomes and subsequently to late endosomes. These findings aid in our understanding of how filoviruses infect cells and suggest that disruption of macropinocytosis may be useful in treatment of infection.

"A mutated KRAS protein is frequently observed in human cancers. Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. Here, by assessing the probabilities of occurrence of all KRAS G12X mutations and KRAS dynamics we show that this assumption does not hold true. Instead, our findings revealed an outstanding mutational bias. We conducted a thorough mutational analysis of KRAS G12X mutations and assessed to what extent the observed mutation frequencies follow a random distribution. Unique tissue-specific frequencies are displayed with specific mutations, especially with G12R, which cannot be explained by random probabilities. To clarify the underlying causes for the nonrandom probabilities, we conducted extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (170 μs) to study the differences of G12X mutations on a molecular level. The simulations revealed an allosteric hydrophobic signaling network in KRAS, and that protein dynamics is altered among the G12X mutants and as such differs from the wild-type and is mutation-specific. The shift in long-timescale conformational dynamics was confirmed with Markov state modeling. A G12X mutation was found to modify KRAS dynamics in an allosteric way, which is especially manifested in the switch regions that are responsible for the effector protein binding. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations.
","The oncogene KRAS is frequently mutated in various cancers. When the amino acid glycine 12 is mutated, KRAS protein acquires oncogenic properties that result in tumor cell-growth and cancer progression. These mutations prevail especially in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which is a cancer with an exceptionally dismal prognosis. To date, there is a limited understanding of the different mutations at the position 12, also regarding whether the different mutations would have different consequences. These discrepancies could have major implications for the future drug therapies targeting KRAS mutant harboring tumors. In this study, we made a critical assessment of the observed frequency of KRAS G12X mutations and the underlying causes for these frequencies. We also assessed KRAS G12X mutant discrepancies on an atomistic level by utilizing state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the dynamics of the mutants does not only differ from the wild-type protein, but there is also a profound difference among the different mutants. These results emphasize that the different KRAS G12X mutations are not equal, and thereby they suggest that the future research related to mutant KRAS biology should account for these observations.

"It has long been known that the brain is limited in the amount of sensory information that it can process at any given time. A well-known form of capacity limitation in vision is the set-size effect, whereby the time needed to find a target increases in the presence of distractors. The set-size effect implies that inputs from multiple objects interfere with each other, but the loci and mechanisms of this interference are unknown. Here we show that the set-size effect has a neural correlate in competitive visuo-visual interactions in the lateral intraparietal area, an area related to spatial attention and eye movements. Monkeys performed a covert visual search task in which they discriminated the orientation of a visual target surrounded by distractors. Neurons encoded target location, but responses associated with both target and distractors declined as a function of distractor number (set size). Firing rates associated with the target in the receptive field correlated with reaction time both within and across set sizes. The findings suggest that competitive visuo-visual interactions in areas related to spatial attention contribute to capacity limitations in visual searches.
","It is well known that the brain is limited in the amount of sensory information that it can process at any given time. During an everyday task such as finding an object in a cluttered environment (known as visual search), observers take longer to find a target as the number of distractors increases. This well-known phenomenon implies that inputs from distractors interfere with the brain's ability to perceive the target at some stage or stages of neural processing. However, the loci and mechanisms of this interference are unknown. Visual information is processed in feature-selective areas that encode the physical properties of stimuli and in higher-order areas that convey information about behavioral significance and help direct attention to individual stimuli. Here we studied a higher-order parietal area related to attention and eye movements. We found that parietal neurons selectively track the location of a search target during a difficult visual search task. However, neuronal firing rates decreased as distractors were added to the display, and the decrease in the target-related response correlated with the set-size-related increase in reaction time. This suggests that distractors trigger competitive visuo-visual interactions that limit the brain's ability to find and focus on a task-relevant target.

"Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are used to treat a variety of diseases because of their potent anti-inflammatory effect and their ability to induce apoptosis in lymphoid malignancies through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Despite ongoing research, high glucocorticoid efficacy and widespread usage in medicine, resistance, disease relapse and toxicity remain factors that need addressing. Understanding the mechanisms of glucocorticoid signalling and how resistance may arise is highly important towards improving therapy. To gain insight into this we undertook a systems biology approach, aiming to generate a Boolean model of the glucocorticoid receptor protein interaction network that encapsulates functional relationships between the GR, its target genes or genes that target GR, and the interactions between the genes that interact with the GR. This model named GEB052 consists of 52 nodes representing genes or proteins, the model input (GC) and model outputs (cell death and inflammation), connected by 241 logical interactions of activation or inhibition. 323 changes in the relationships between model constituents following in silico knockouts were uncovered, and steady-state analysis followed by cell-based microarray genome-wide model validation led to an average of 57% correct predictions, which was taken further by assessment of model predictions against patient microarray data. Lastly, semi-quantitative model analysis via microarray data superimposed onto the model with a score flow algorithm has also been performed, which demonstrated significantly higher correct prediction ratios (average of 80%), and the model has been assessed as a predictive clinical tool using published patient microarray data. In summary we present an in silico simulation of the glucocorticoid receptor interaction network, linked to downstream biological processes that can be analysed to uncover relationships between GR and its interactants. Ultimately the model provides a platform for future development both by directing laboratory research and allowing for incorporation of further components, encapsulating more interactions/genes involved in glucocorticoid receptor signalling.
","Here we present modelling of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signalling network. The GR is the effector for a class of drugs known as corticosteroids, which are widely used in medicine for their anti-inflammatory effects and ability to induce apoptosis in leukaemic cells. However, side effects, treatment-related toxicity and glucocorticoid resistance remain and therefore increased understanding of the glucocorticoid receptor mechanism of action may improve therapeutic outcomes. The GEB052 model presented herein has been used to generate predictions for how the network is altered between glucocorticoid-sensitive and glucocorticoid-resistant scenarios, and these predictions have been verified using published gene expression data from established cell lines (for both qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis). The model has also been preliminarily assessed as a predictive clinical tool by correlating model predictions with clinical outcomes of thirteen leukaemia patients. Thus, the GEB052 model demonstrates successful modelling to understand GR function. GEB052 provides accurate predictions and has indicated potential routes through which glucocorticoid resistance may arise. The work presented herein thus demonstrates a proof-of-principle of this modelling approach to furthering GR research, and provides insight into potential mechanisms of corticosteroids resistance.

"While many models of biological object recognition share a common set of “broad-stroke” properties, the performance of any one model depends strongly on the choice of parameters in a particular instantiation of that model—e.g., the number of units per layer, the size of pooling kernels, exponents in normalization operations, etc. Since the number of such parameters (explicit or implicit) is typically large and the computational cost of evaluating one particular parameter set is high, the space of possible model instantiations goes largely unexplored. Thus, when a model fails to approach the abilities of biological visual systems, we are left uncertain whether this failure is because we are missing a fundamental idea or because the correct “parts” have not been tuned correctly, assembled at sufficient scale, or provided with enough training. Here, we present a high-throughput approach to the exploration of such parameter sets, leveraging recent advances in stream processing hardware (high-end NVIDIA graphic cards and the PlayStation 3's IBM Cell Processor). In analogy to high-throughput screening approaches in molecular biology and genetics, we explored thousands of potential network architectures and parameter instantiations, screening those that show promising object recognition performance for further analysis. We show that this approach can yield significant, reproducible gains in performance across an array of basic object recognition tasks, consistently outperforming a variety of state-of-the-art purpose-built vision systems from the literature. As the scale of available computational power continues to expand, we argue that this approach has the potential to greatly accelerate progress in both artificial vision and our understanding of the computational underpinning of biological vision.
","One of the primary obstacles to understanding the computational underpinnings of biological vision is its sheer scale—the visual system is a massively parallel computer, comprised of billions of elements. While this scale has historically been beyond the reach of even the fastest super-computing systems, recent advances in commodity graphics processors (such as those found in the PlayStation 3 and high-end NVIDIA graphics cards) have made unprecedented computational resources broadly available. Here, we describe a high-throughput approach that harnesses the power of modern graphics hardware to search a vast space of large-scale, biologically inspired candidate models of the visual system. The best of these models, drawn from thousands of candidates, outperformed a variety of state-of-the-art vision systems across a range of object and face recognition tasks. We argue that these experiments point a new way forward, both in the creation of machine vision systems and in providing insights into the computational underpinnings of biological vision.

"Both constitutive secretion and Ca2+-regulated exocytosis require the assembly of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. At present, little is known about how the SNARE complexes mediating these two distinct pathways differ in structure. Using the Drosophila neuromuscular synapse as a model, we show that a mutation modifying a hydrophobic layer in syntaxin 1A regulates the rate of vesicle fusion. Syntaxin 1A molecules share a highly conserved threonine in the C-terminal +7 layer near the transmembrane domain. Mutation of this threonine to isoleucine results in a structural change that more closely resembles those found in syntaxins ascribed to the constitutive secretory pathway. Flies carrying the I254 mutant protein have increased levels of SNARE complexes and dramatically enhanced rate of both constitutive and evoked vesicle fusion. In contrast, overexpression of the T254 wild-type protein in neurons reduces vesicle fusion only in the I254 mutant background. These results are consistent with molecular dynamics simulations of the SNARE core complex, suggesting that T254 serves as an internal brake to dampen SNARE zippering and impede vesicle fusion, whereas I254 favors fusion by enhancing intermolecular interaction within the SNARE core complex.
","Most living cells constantly renew their membrane compositions and frequently communicate with neighboring cells by delivering cargo molecules from small vesicles. A key step in cargo delivery requires the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the target membrane mediated by SNARE proteins. In most cellular compartments, fusion occurs constitutively, requiring little participation of other molecules. In other cellular compartments, such as synapses in the nervous system, vesicle fusion is predominantly triggered by intracellular calcium ions. At present, constitutive and regulated fusion modes are not well understood.
In this study, we found that a mutant SNARE protein, syntaxin at the synapse, contained a building block commonly conserved for syntaxins functioning along constitutive secretory pathways. Further, our modeling predicted that the mutant syntaxin could form a tightly packed SNARE bundle closely resembling that found in the endosome, but differing from the relatively loosely packed bundle found at the wild-type synapse. Our experimental data support the hypothesis that the mutant syntaxin lowered the energy barrier for vesicle fusion by tightening the SNARE bundle. These findings reveal a novel, intrinsic structural feature of the SNARE complex that regulates vesicle fusion rate at different cellular compartments.

"Meiosis is a cellular program that generates haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. While chromosome events that contribute to reducing ploidy (homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination) are well conserved, their execution varies across species and even between sexes of the same species. The telomere bouquet is a conserved feature of meiosis that was first described nearly a century ago, yet its role is still debated. Here we took advantage of the prominent telomere bouquet in zebrafish, Danio rerio, and super-resolution microscopy to show that axis morphogenesis, synapsis, and the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) all take place within the immediate vicinity of telomeres. We established a coherent timeline of events and tested the dependence of each event on the formation of Spo11-induced DSBs. First, we found that the axis protein Sycp3 loads adjacent to telomeres and extends inward, suggesting a specific feature common to all telomeres seeds the development of the axis. Second, we found that newly formed axes near telomeres engage in presynaptic co-alignment by a mechanism that depends on DSBs, even when stable juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes at interstitial regions is not yet evident. Third, we were surprised to discover that ~30% of telomeres in early prophase I engage in associations between two or more chromosome ends and these interactions decrease in later stages. Finally, while pairing and synapsis were disrupted in both spo11 males and females, their reproductive phenotypes were starkly different; spo11 mutant males failed to produce sperm while females produced offspring with severe developmental defects. Our results support zebrafish as an important vertebrate model for meiosis with implications for differences in fertility and genetically derived birth defects in males and females.
","Inherent to reproduction is the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next. In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes an equal amount of genetic information, packaged in chromosomes, to the offspring. Diploid organisms, like humans, have two copies of every chromosome, while their haploid gametes (e.g. eggs and sperm) have only one. This reduction in ploidy depends on the segregation of chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in gametes with one copy of each chromosome. Missegregation of the chromosomes in the parents leads to abnormal chromosome numbers in the offspring, which is usually lethal or has detrimental developmental effects. While it has been known for over a century that homologous chromosomes pair and recombine to facilitate proper segregation, how homologs find their partners has remained elusive. A structure that has been central to the discussion of homolog pairing is the bouquet, or the dynamic clustering of telomeres during early stages of meiosis. Here we use zebrafish to show that the telomere bouquet is the site where key events leading to homologous chromosome pairing are coordinated. Furthermore, we show that deletion of spo11, a gene required for proper recombination in most studied organisms, resulted in very different effects in males and females where males were sterile while females produced deformed progeny.

"Hysteresis, the discrepancy in forward and reverse pathways of state transitions, is observed during changing levels of consciousness. Identifying the underlying mechanism of hysteresis phenomena in the brain will enhance the ability to understand, monitor, and control state transitions related to consciousness. We hypothesized that hysteresis in brain networks shares the same underlying mechanism of hysteresis as other biological and non-biological networks. In particular, we hypothesized that the principle of explosive synchronization, which can mediate abrupt state transitions, would be critical to explaining hysteresis in the brain during conscious state transitions. We analyzed high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) that was acquired in healthy human volunteers during conscious state transitions induced by the general anesthetics sevoflurane or ketamine. We developed a novel method to monitor the temporal evolution of EEG networks in a parameter space, which consists of the strength and topography of EEG-based networks. Furthermore, we studied conditions of explosive synchronization in anatomically informed human brain network models. We identified hysteresis in the trajectory of functional brain networks during state transitions. The model study and empirical data analysis explained various hysteresis phenomena during the loss and recovery of consciousness in a principled way: (1) more potent anesthetics induce a larger hysteresis; (2) a larger range of EEG frequencies facilitates transitions into unconsciousness and impedes the return of consciousness; (3) hysteresis of connectivity is larger than that of EEG power; and (4) the structure and strength of functional brain networks reconfigure differently during the loss vs. recovery of consciousness. We conclude that the hysteresis phenomena observed during the loss and recovery of consciousness are generic network features. Furthermore, the state transitions are grounded in the same principle as state transitions in complex non-biological networks, especially during perturbation. These findings suggest the possibility of predicting and modulating hysteresis of conscious state transitions in large-scale brain networks.
","Hysteresis, characterized by distinct forward and reverse phase transitions, is ubiquitous in nature. For example, there are distinct temperatures for water freezing and ice melting. Similarly, it has been found that state transitions related to consciousness exhibit hysteresis. In particular, the concentration of general anesthetics required to achieve loss of consciousness is significantly higher than the concentration at which consciousness is regained. However, it is unknown whether this is trivially reducible to the pharmacology of these drugs or if it is something related to brain function itself. In this study, we took a novel, network-based approach and hypothesized that the hysteresis observed during anesthetic state transitions shares the same underlying mechanism as that observed in non-biological networks. Our computational modeling, analytic study, and high-density human EEG analysis suggest that various hysteresis phenomena during loss and recovery of consciousness can be explained in principled ways by generic network features. Identifying these network mechanisms of hysteresis in the brain also provides a unified framework for understanding the radically different conscious state transitions associated with sleep, anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness.

"Universal coverage with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is a primary control strategy against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, its impact on the three other main species of human malaria and lymphatic filariasis (LF), which share the same vectors in many co-endemic areas, is not as well characterized. The recent development of multiplex antibody detection provides the opportunity for simultaneous evaluation of the impact of control measures on the burden of multiple diseases.
Two cross-sectional household surveys at baseline and one year after a LLIN distribution campaign were implemented in Mecubúri and Nacala-a-Velha Districts in Nampula Province, Mozambique. Both districts were known to be endemic for LF; both received mass drug administration (MDA) with antifilarial drugs during the evaluation period. Access to and use of LLINs was recorded, and household members were tested with P. falciparum rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Dried blood spots were collected and analyzed for presence of antibodies to three P. falciparum antigens, P. vivax MSP-119, P. ovale MSP-119, P. malariae MSP-119, and three LF antigens. Seroconversion rates were calculated and the association between LLIN use and post-campaign seropositivity was estimated using multivariate regression. The campaign covered 68% (95% CI: 58–77) of the population in Nacala-a-Velha and 46% (37–56) in Mecubúri. There was no statistically significant change in P. falciparum RDT positivity between the two surveys. Population seropositivity at baseline ranged from 31–81% for the P. falciparum antigens, 3–4% for P. vivax MSP-119, 41–43% for P. ovale MSP-119, 46–56% for P. malariae MSP-119, and 37–76% for the LF antigens. The seroconversion rate to the LF Bm33 antigen decreased significantly in both districts. The seroconversion rate to P. malariae MSP-119 and the LF Wb123 and Bm14 antigens each decreased significantly in one of the two districts. Community LLIN use was associated with a decreased risk of P. falciparum RDT positivity, P. falciparum LSA-1 seropositivity, and P. malariae MSP-119 seropositivity, but not LF antigen seropositivity.
The study area noted significant declines in LF seropositivity, but these were not associated with LLIN use. The MDA could have masked any impact of the LLINs on population LF seropositivity. The LLIN campaign did not reach adequately high coverage to decrease P. falciparum RDT positivity, the most common measure of P. falciparum burden. However, the significant decreases in the seroconversion rate to the P. malariae antigen, coupled with an association between community LLIN use and individual-level decreases in seropositivity to P. falciparum and P. malariae antigens show evidence of impact of the LLIN campaign and highlight the utility of using multiantigenic serological approaches for measuring intervention impact.
","Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the principal cause of illness and death in Mozambique. However, the same mosquitoes that transmit P. falciparum parasites also transmit three other species of malaria (P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax) and the worm that causes lymphatic filariasis. To date, we do not know how much transmission of the three other species of malaria occurs. We also do not know if control interventions such as the distribution of bed nets reduce the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and non-falciparum malaria. To address this question, we sampled community members immediately following and one year after a bed net distribution campaign in Mozambique. We analyzed their blood for the presence of antibodies to four species of malaria and lymphatic filariasis. We found that a substantial proportion of individuals had antibodies to P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and the worms causing lymphatic filariasis. We found much lower rates of seropositivity to P. vivax. Individuals reporting using bed nets had a lower risk of testing positive for P. falciparum and P. malariae antibodies. The proportion of the population with access to and using bed nets was too low to cause a population-wide decrease in malaria transmission. There was a significant decline in lymphatic filariasis seropositivity between the two surveys, but we could not attribute it to the bed net distribution campaign. Measuring antibody levels for multiple diseases simultaneously has utility in assessing intervention impact.

"Previously, we identified an adolescent idiopathic scoliosis susceptibility locus near human ladybird homeobox 1 (LBX1) and FLJ41350 by a genome-wide association study. Here, we characterized the associated non-coding variant and investigated the function of these genes. A chromosome conformation capture assay revealed that the genome region with the most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (rs11190870) physically interacted with the promoter region of LBX1-FLJ41350. The promoter in the direction of LBX1, combined with a 590-bp region including rs11190870, had higher transcriptional activity with the risk allele than that with the non-risk allele in HEK 293T cells. The ubiquitous overexpression of human LBX1 or either of the zebrafish lbx genes (lbx1a, lbx1b, and lbx2), but not FLJ41350, in zebrafish embryos caused body curvature followed by death prior to vertebral column formation. Such body axis deformation was not observed in transcription activator-like effector nucleases mediated knockout zebrafish of lbx1b or lbx2. Mosaic expression of lbx1b driven by the GATA2 minimal promoter and the lbx1b enhancer in zebrafish significantly alleviated the embryonic lethal phenotype to allow observation of the later onset of the spinal curvature with or without vertebral malformation. Deformation of the embryonic body axis by lbx1b overexpression was associated with defects in convergent extension, which is a component of the main axis-elongation machinery in gastrulating embryos. In embryos overexpressing lbx1b, wnt5b, a ligand of the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, was significantly downregulated. Injection of mRNA for wnt5b or RhoA, a key downstream effector of Wnt/PCP signaling, rescued the defective convergent extension phenotype and attenuated the lbx1b-induced curvature of the body axis. Thus, our study presents a novel pathological feature of LBX1 and its zebrafish homologs in body axis deformation at various stages of embryonic and subsequent growth in zebrafish.
","Scoliosis is the most common type of spinal deformity with a lateral spinal curvature of at least 10 degrees, affecting 2–4% of the population. Scoliosis caused by a primary problem related to the spine itself is classified into congenital scoliosis (CS) and idiopathic scoliosis (IS). Among these, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the most common form of scoliosis, is known as a common polygenic disease. Severe curving of the spine in scoliosis leads to profound psychological and social impacts, but etiology-based therapies have not been established since the precise pathological mechanisms of both IS and CS remain undefined. Previously, we identified an AIS susceptibility locus near human ladybird homeobox 1 (LBX1) by a genome-wide association study. Here, we report the functional characterization of the most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11190870 and LBX1 as well as its zebrafish homologues. Overexpression of LBX1 and zebrafish lbx genes caused lateral body curvature in association with the impairment of non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling. Thus, our study presents a novel pathological feature of LBX1 in body axis deformation.

"Tuberculosis remains a global pandemic and drives lung matrix destruction to transmit. Whilst pathways driving inflammatory responses in macrophages have been relatively well described, negative regulatory pathways are less well defined. We hypothesised that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) specifically targets negative regulatory pathways to augment immunopathology. Inhibition of signalling through the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway increased matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) gene expression and secretion, a collagenase central to TB pathogenesis, and multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. In patients with confirmed pulmonary TB, PI3Kδ expression was absent within granulomas. Furthermore, Mtb infection suppressed PI3Kδ gene expression in macrophages. Interestingly, inhibition of the MNK pathway, downstream of pro-inflammatory p38 and ERK MAPKs, also increased MMP-1 secretion, whilst suppressing secretion of TH1 cytokines. Cross-talk between the PI3K and MNK pathways was demonstrated at the level of eIF4E phosphorylation. Mtb globally suppressed the MMP-inhibitory pathways in macrophages, reducing levels of mRNAs encoding PI3Kδ, mTORC-1 and MNK-1 via upregulation of miRNAs. Therefore, Mtb disrupts negative regulatory pathways at multiple levels in macrophages to drive a tissue-destructive phenotype that facilitates transmission.
","The mechanisms whereby Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) evades host immunity are well described, but Mtb must also engage the host immune response to drive tissue destruction, cavitation and transmission as part of its life cycle. We identify negative regulatory pathways that suppress pathogenic matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression in primary human macrophages, including a previously unidentified role of the MAP kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) pathway in inhibiting protease secretion. Furthermore, these pathways are suppressed in granulomas of patients with culture-proven pulmonary tuberculosis and in infected macrophages in vitro. Stability of mRNA encoding negative regulatory molecules is reduced, and Mtb upregulates multiple microRNAs predicted to target their 3’UTR. Together, these findings demonstrate that Mtb skews the macrophage phenotype towards tissue destruction by disrupting negative regulatory pathways.

"The Bacillus subtilis GlmR (formerly YvcK) protein is essential for growth on gluconeogenic carbon sources. Mutants lacking GlmR display a variety of phenotypes suggestive of impaired cell wall synthesis including antibiotic sensitivity, aberrant cell morphology and lysis. To define the role of GlmR, we selected suppressor mutations that ameliorate the sensitivity of a glmR null mutant to the beta-lactam antibiotic cefuroxime or restore growth on gluconeogenic carbon sources. Several of the resulting suppressors increase the expression of the GlmS and GlmM proteins that catalyze the first two committed steps in the diversion of carbon from central carbon metabolism into peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Chemical complementation studies indicate that the absence of GlmR can be overcome by provision of cells with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), even under conditions where GlcNAc cannot re-enter central metabolism and serve as a carbon source for growth. Our results indicate that GlmR facilitates the diversion of carbon from the central metabolite fructose-6-phosphate, which is limiting in cells growing on gluconeogenic carbon sources, into peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Our data suggest that GlmR stimulates GlmS activity, and we propose that this activation is antagonized by the known GlmR ligand and peptidoglycan intermediate UDP-GlcNAc. Thus, GlmR presides over a new mechanism for the regulation of carbon partitioning between central metabolism and peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
","Bacterial cells are surrounded by a peptidoglycan cell wall that is, under most conditions, required for viability. Synthesis of the cell wall requires a considerable diversion of resources from central carbon metabolism into a lipid-linked precursor (lipid II) that is exported from the cell for wall assembly. Here, we propose that GlmR presides over a new mechanism for the regulation of carbon partitioning between central metabolism and peptidoglycan biosynthesis: GlmR activates the GlmS-dependent diversion of carbon from the glycolytic pathway into peptidoglycan synthesis. This effect is particularly important during gluconeogenesis since the GlmS substrate fructose 6-phosphate is present at a reduced level under these conditions.

"Mosquitoes are vectors of many serious pathogens in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Current control strategies almost entirely rely upon insecticides, which increasingly face the problems of high cost, increasing mosquito resistance and negative effects on non-target organisms. Alternative strategies include the proposed use of inherited life-shortening agents, such as the Wolbachia bacterium. By shortening mosquito vector lifespan, Wolbachia could potentially reduce the vectorial capacity of mosquito populations. We have recently been able to stably transinfect Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the life-shortening Wolbachia strain wMelPop, and are assessing various aspects of its interaction with the mosquito host to determine its likely impact on pathogen transmission as well as its potential ability to invade A. aegypti populations.
Here we have examined the probing behavior of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in an attempt to understand both the broader impact of Wolbachia infection on mosquito biology and, in particular, vectorial capacity. The probing behavior of wMelPop-infected mosquitoes at four adult ages was examined and compared to uninfected controls during video-recorded feeding trials on a human hand. Wolbachia-positive insects, from 15 days of age, showed a drastic increase in the time spent pre-probing and probing relative to uninfected controls. Two other important features for blood feeding, saliva volume and apyrase content of saliva, were also studied.
As A. aegypti infected with wMelPop age, they show increasing difficulty in completing the process of blood feeding effectively and efficiently. Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes on average produced smaller volumes of saliva that still contained the same amount of apyrase activity as uninfected mosquitoes. These effects on blood feeding behavior may reduce vectorial capacity and point to underlying physiological changes in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.
","Mosquitoes transmit diseases when they are actively searching for a source of blood. This so called probing behavior comprises the “searching” time, the beginning of the feeding process until the first sign of blood can be seen within the insect body. The manipulation of this behavior can have important consequences for the mosquito's ability to transmit pathogens, such as dengue virus or Plasmodium. In this study we examined the probing behavior of the main vector of dengue viruses, Aedes aegypti, when infected with an intracellular bacterium, Wolbachia pipientis. This bacterium alters the probing behavior of older mosquitoes such that they take longer to find a feeding site and longer to imbibe blood, which may make them more susceptible to human defense responses. The bacterium appears to reduce mosquito feeding success by preventing the mosquito from successfully inserting its stylet into human skin. The old age onset of reduced mosquito feeding success due to Wolbachia could selectively promote a reduction in dengue transmission.

"The seed maturation program only occurs during late embryogenesis, and repression of the program is pivotal for seedling development. However, the mechanism through which this repression is achieved in vegetative tissues is poorly understood. Here we report a microRNA (miRNA)–mediated repression mechanism operating in leaves. To understand the repression of the embryonic program in seedlings, we have conducted a genetic screen using a seed maturation gene reporter transgenic line in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) for the isolation of mutants that ectopically express seed maturation genes in leaves. One of the mutants identified from the screen is a weak allele of ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) that encodes an effector protein for small RNAs. We first show that it is the defect in the accumulation of miRNAs rather than other small RNAs that causes the ectopic seed gene expression in ago1. We then demonstrate that overexpression of miR166 suppresses the derepression of the seed gene reporter in ago1 and that, conversely, the specific loss of miR166 causes ectopic expression of seed maturation genes. Further, we show that ectopic expression of miR166 targets, type III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) genes PHABULOSA (PHB) and PHAVOLUTA (PHV), is sufficient to activate seed maturation genes in vegetative tissues. Lastly, we show that PHB binds the promoter of LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2), which encodes a master regulator of seed maturation. Therefore, this study establishes a core module composed of a miRNA, its target genes (PHB and PHV), and the direct target of PHB (LEC2) as an underlying mechanism that keeps the seed maturation program off during vegetative development.
","Seed development can be conceptually divided into two phases: namely the morphogenesis phase, in which cell division is active and all the major organs are formed, and the maturation phase, in which cells enlarge and storage reserves are synthesized and accumulated. Expression of the seed maturation program is tightly controlled such that it only occurs during the late phase of seed development. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the repression of seed genes during vegetative development, we performed a reporter-assisted genetic screen, and one mutant identified is a weak allele of ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) that displays ectopic seed gene expression. We then performed a series of transgenic and genetic analyses to search for the molecular mechanisms underlying the mutant phenotype. We first demonstrate that the decrease in miR166 in ago1 is a major cause of the mutant phenotype. Further, we show that the targets of miR166, type III HD-ZIP transcription factors PHB and PHV, are sufficient for derepressing seed maturation genes in seedlings, likely by binding directly to the promoter of a master regulator gene of maturation. Thus, this work establishes a miRNA–mediated pathway that represses the embryonic program and also establishes PHB/PHV as direct activators of the maturation program.

"The role of host movement in the spread of vector-borne diseases of livestock has been little studied. Here we develop a mathematical framework that allows us to disentangle and quantify the roles of vector dispersal and livestock movement in transmission between farms. We apply this framework to outbreaks of bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in Great Britain, both of which are spread by Culicoides biting midges and have recently emerged in northern Europe. For BTV we estimate parameters by fitting the model to outbreak data using approximate Bayesian computation, while for SBV we use previously derived estimates. We find that around 90% of transmission of BTV between farms is a result of vector dispersal, while for SBV this proportion is 98%. This difference is a consequence of higher vector competence and shorter duration of viraemia for SBV compared with BTV. For both viruses we estimate that the mean number of secondary infections per infected farm is greater than one for vector dispersal, but below one for livestock movements. Although livestock movements account for a small proportion of transmission and cannot sustain an outbreak on their own, they play an important role in establishing new foci of infection. However, the impact of restricting livestock movements on the spread of both viruses depends critically on assumptions made about the distances over which vector dispersal occurs. If vector dispersal occurs primarily at a local scale (99% of transmission occurs <25 km), movement restrictions are predicted to be effective at reducing spread, but if dispersal occurs frequently over longer distances (99% of transmission occurs <50 km) they are not.
","Diseases which are transmitted by the bites of insects can be spread to new locations through the movement of both infected insects and infected hosts. The importance of these routes has implications for disease control, because we can often restrict host movement, and so potentially reduce spread, but cannot easily restrict insect movements. Despite this, the importance of host movements has been little studied. Here we develop a mathematical model which allows us to disentangle and quantify transmission by insect dispersal and by host movement. We apply the model to two diseases of cattle and sheep transmitted by biting midges that have emerged in northern Europe in the past decade, bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV). For both viruses, we show insect movements account for a majority of spread between farms. Although they cannot sustain an epidemic on their own, animal movements play an important role in introducing disease to new areas.

"Despite the substantial attention to primary care (PC), few studies have addressed the relationship between patients’ experience with PC and their health status in low-and middle-income countries. This study aimed to (1) test the association between overall patient-centered PC experience (OPCE) and self-rated health (SRH) and (2) identify specific features of patient-centered PC associated with better SRH (i.e., excellent or very good SRH) in 6 Latin American and Caribbean countries.
We conducted a secondary analysis of a 2013 public opinion cross-sectional survey on perceptions and experiences with healthcare systems in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Mexico, and Panama; the data were nationally representative for urban populations. We analyzed 9 features of patient-centered PC. We calculated OPCE score as the arithmetic mean of the PC features. OPCE score ranged from 0 to 1, where 0 meant that the participant did not have any of the 9 patient-centered PC experiences, while 1 meant that he/she reported having all these experiences. After testing for interaction on the additive scale, we analyzed countries pooled for aim 1, with an interaction term for Mexico, and each country separately for aim 2. We used multiple Poisson regression models double-weighted by survey and inverse probability weights to deal with the survey design and missing data. The study included 6,100 participants. The percentage of participants with excellent or very good SRH ranged from 29.5% in Mexico to 52.4% in Jamaica. OPCE was associated with reporting excellent or very good SRH in all countries: adjusting for socio-demographic and health covariates, patients with an OPCE score of 1 in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, and Panama were more likely to report excellent or very good SRH than those with a score of 0 (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.61, 95% CI 1.37–1.90, p < 0.001); in Mexico, this association was even stronger (aPR 4.27, 95% CI 2.34–7.81, p < 0.001). The specific features of patient-centered PC associated with better SRH differed by country. The perception that PC providers solve most health problems was associated with excellent or very good SRH in Colombia (aPR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01–1.91, p = 0.046) and Jamaica (aPR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02–1.43, p = 0.030). Having a provider who knows relevant medical history was positively associated with better SRH in Mexico (aPR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03–2.12, p = 0.036) but was negatively associated with better SRH in Brazil (aPR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56–0.89, p = 0.003). Finally, easy contact with PC facility (Mexico: aPR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04–1.74, p = 0.023), coordination of care (Mexico: aPR 1.53, 95% CI 1.19–1.98, p = 0.001), and opportunity to ask questions (Brazil: aPR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11–1.83, p = 0.006) were each associated with better SRH. The main study limitation consists in the analysis being of cross-sectional data, which does not allow making causal inferences or identifying the direction of the association between the variables.
Overall, a higher OPCE score was associated with better SRH in these 6 Latin American and Caribbean countries; associations between specific characteristics of patient-centered PC and SRH differed by country. The findings underscore the importance of high-quality, patient-centered PC as a path to improved population health.
","In the 40 years since the Declaration of Alma-Ata, empirical studies using ecological data have shown positive effects of access to primary care on population health outcomes, such as child mortality, adult overall mortality, and adult avoidable hospitalizations, both in high-income countries and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
In the context of LMICs, the centrality of primary care has been questioned by findings of its poor quality and its limitations in adapting to urbanization and to the epidemiological transition, as well as the increasing population demand for responsive, high-quality services.
To our knowledge, no individual-level studies have examined the relationship between the attributes of patient-centered primary care and self-rated health (SRH) in the context of LMICs.
Using person-level survey data representative of the urban population of 6 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the current study shows that individuals who reported receiving more patient-centered primary care overall were more likely to report excellent or very good SRH status in all countries. Features of primary care associated with better SRH differed between countries.
The expansion of primary care in LMICs can be informed by better evidence on which of its features—including ease of communication, comprehensiveness of care, and support for coordination of care—are associated with better self-reported health status.
While individual-level administrative data are not yet widely available for health systems in LMICs, patient-reported survey data may serve as an instrument to assess healthcare services and to inform policy-makers in their efforts to increase the quality of primary care services.

"The equine-associated obligate pathogen Burkholderia mallei was developed by reductive evolution involving a substantial portion of the genome from Burkholderia pseudomallei, a free-living opportunistic pathogen. With its short history of divergence (∼3.5 myr), B. mallei provides an excellent resource to study the early steps in bacterial genome reductive evolution in the host. By examining 20 genomes of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei, we found that stepwise massive expansion of IS (insertion sequence) elements ISBma1, ISBma2, and IS407A occurred during the evolution of B. mallei. Each element proliferated through the sites where its target selection preference was met. Then, ISBma1 and ISBma2 contributed to the further spread of IS407A by providing secondary insertion sites. This spread increased genomic deletions and rearrangements, which were predominantly mediated by IS407A. There were also nucleotide-level disruptions in a large number of genes. However, no significant signs of erosion were yet noted in these genes. Intriguingly, all these genomic modifications did not seriously alter the gene expression patterns inherited from B. pseudomallei. This efficient and elaborate genomic transition was enabled largely through the formation of the highly flexible IS-blended genome and the guidance by selective forces in the host. The detailed IS intervention, unveiled for the first time in this study, may represent the key component of a general mechanism for early bacterial evolution in the host.
","It has been known for some time that bacteria undergo genome-reduction when they transition from a free-living state to a constantly host-restricted state. High levels of IS element expansion were also found in these bacteria, and the IS elements were suggested to play a role in genome reductive evolution. Here we provide evidence for stepwise IS actions as the exclusive mechanism that mediates bacterial genomic changes during the early stage of constant host-bacterial association, by unveiling the processes that resulted in the development of B. mallei genome. We show the details of the multi-level interplay of IS elements, which facilitate the wide spread of the IS copies, and the overall mechanics in genome reduction and rearrangement. These processes appeared to operate as chain reactions mediating elaborate genomic transition, without seriously affecting the original gene expression patterns. The absence of differential gene expression in the resulting genome suggests that changes in transcriptional regulation that are often observed in other old bacterial genomes may take place subsequent to the IS-mediated steps, along with gradual nucleotide-level changes.

"Cell migration in 3D microenvironments is fundamental to development, homeostasis and the pathobiology of diseases such as cancer. Rab-coupling protein (RCP) dependent co-trafficking of α5β1 and EGFR1 promotes cancer cell invasion into fibronectin (FN) containing extracellular matrix (ECM), by potentiating EGFR1 signalling at the front of invasive cells. This promotes a switch in RhoGTPase signalling to inhibit Rac1 and activate a RhoA-ROCK-Formin homology domain-containing 3 (FHOD3) pathway and generate filopodial actin-spike protrusions which drive invasion. To further understand the signalling network that drives RCP-driven invasive migration, we generated a Boolean logical model based on existing network pathways/models, where each node can be interrogated by computational simulation. The model predicted an unanticipated feedback loop, whereby Raf/MEK/ERK signalling maintains suppression of Rac1 by inhibiting the Rac-activating Sos1-Eps8-Abi1 complex, allowing RhoA activity to predominate in invasive protrusions. MEK inhibition was sufficient to promote lamellipodia formation and oppose filopodial actin-spike formation, and led to activation of Rac and inactivation of RhoA at the leading edge of cells moving in 3D matrix. Furthermore, MEK inhibition abrogated RCP/α5β1/EGFR1-driven invasive migration. However, upon knockdown of Eps8 (to suppress the Sos1-Abi1-Eps8 complex), MEK inhibition had no effect on RhoGTPase activity and did not oppose invasive migration, suggesting that MEK-ERK signalling suppresses the Rac-activating Sos1-Abi1-Eps8 complex to maintain RhoA activity and promote filopodial actin-spike formation and invasive migration. Our study highlights the predictive potential of mathematical modelling approaches, and demonstrates that a simple intervention (MEK-inhibition) could be of therapeutic benefit in preventing invasive migration and metastasis.
","The majority of cancer-related fatalities are caused by the movement of cancer cells away from the primary site to form metastases, making understanding the signalling mechanisms which underpin cell migration and invasion through their local environment of paramount importance. Much has been discovered about key events leading to invasive cell migration. Here, we have taken this prior knowledge to build a powerful predictive model based on simple ON/OFF relations and logic to determine potential intervention targets to reduce harmful invasive migration. Interrogating our model, we have identified a negative feedback loop important to the signalling that determines invasive migration, the breaking of which reverts cells to a slower, less invasive phenotype. We have supported this feedback loop prediction using an array of in vitro experiments performed in cells within 2-D and physiologically relevant 3-D environments. Our findings demonstrate the predictive power of such modelling techniques, and could form the basis for clinical intervention to prevent metastasis in certain cancers.

"The role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis remains unclear. HIV-1 infection in the humanized mouse model leads to persistent HIV-1 infection and immunopathogenesis, including type I interferons (IFN-I) induction, immune-activation and depletion of human leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. We developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice. When pDC were depleted prior to HIV-1 infection, the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished during acute HIV-1 infection with either a highly pathogenic CCR5/CXCR4-dual tropic HIV-1 or a standard CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate. Consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. Interestingly, the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1 induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs, but not the blood, was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. The increased cell number in lymphoid organs was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. We conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest that pDC-depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retrovirus treatment.
","Persistent expression of IFN-I is correlated with disease progression in HIV-1 infected humans or SIV-infected monkeys. Thus, persistent pDC activation has been implicated in contributing to AIDS pathogenesis. To define the role of pDC in HIV-1 infection and immunopathogenesis in vivo, we developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically and efficiently depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice. We discover that pDC are the critical IFN-I producer cells in response to acute HIV-1 infection, because depletion of pDC completely abolished induction of IFN-I or ISG by HIV-1 infection, correlated with elevated level of HIV-1 replication. When pDC were depleted during chronic HIV-1 infection in humanized mice, pDC were still the major IFN-I producing cells in vivo, which contributed to HIV-1 suppression. Despite of higher level of viral replication in pDC-depleted mice, we found that HIV-induced depletion of human T cells and leukocytes was significantly reduced in lymphoid organs, correlated with reduced cell death induction by HIV-1 infection. Our findings demonstrate that pDC play two opposing roles in HIV-1 pathogenesis: they produce IFN-I to suppress HIV-1 replication and induce death of human immune cells to contribute to HIV-induced T cell depletion and immunopathogenesis.

"Like other domesticates, the efficient utilization of nitrogen resources is also important for the only fully domesticated insect, the silkworm. Deciphering the way in which artificial selection acts on the silkworm genome to improve the utilization of nitrogen resources and to advance human-favored domestication traits, will provide clues from a unique insect model for understanding the general rules of Darwin's evolutionary theory on domestication. Storage proteins (SPs), which belong to a hemocyanin superfamily, basically serve as a source of amino acids and nitrogen during metamorphosis and reproduction in insects. In this study, through blast searching on the silkworm genome and further screening of the artificial selection signature on silkworm SPs, we discovered a candidate domestication gene, i.e., the methionine-rich storage protein 1 (SP1), which is clearly divergent from other storage proteins and exhibits increased expression in the ova of domestic silkworms. Knockout of SP1 via the CRISPR/Cas9 technique resulted in a dramatic decrease in egg hatchability, without obvious impact on egg production, which was similar to the effect in the wild silkworm compared with the domestic type. Larval development and metamorphosis were not affected by SP1 knockout. Comprehensive ova comparative transcriptomes indicated significant higher expression of genes encoding vitellogenin, chorions, and structural components in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-interaction pathway, enzymes in folate biosynthesis, and notably hormone synthesis in the domestic silkworm, compared to both the SP1 mutant and the wild silkworm. Moreover, compared with the wild silkworms, the domestic one also showed generally up-regulated expression of genes enriched in the structural constituent of ribosome and amide, as well as peptide biosynthesis. This study exemplified a novel case in which artificial selection could act directly on nitrogen resource proteins, further affecting egg nutrients and eggshell formation possibly through a hormone signaling mediated regulatory network and the activation of ribosomes, resulting in improved biosynthesis and increased hatchability during domestication. These findings shed new light on both the understanding of artificial selection and silkworm breeding from the perspective of nitrogen and amino acid resources.
","Like other domesticates, nitrogen resources are also important for the only fully domesticated insect, the silkworm. Deciphering the way in which artificial selection acts on the silkworm genome to improve the utilization of nitrogen resources, thereby advancing human-favored domestication traits, will provide clues from a unique insect model for understanding the general rules of Darwin's theory on artificial selection. However, the mechanisms of domestication in the silkworm remain largely unknown. In this study, we focused on one important nitrogen resource, the storage protein (SP). We discovered that the methionine-rich storage protein 1 (SP1), which is divergent from other SPs, is the only target of artificial selection. Based on functional evidence, together with key findings from the comprehensive comparative transcriptome, we propose that artificial selection favored higher expression of SP1 in the domestic silkworm, which would influence the genes or pathways vital for egg development and eggshell formation. Artificial selection also consistently favored activated ribosome activities and improved amide and peptide biosynthesis in the ova, like what they may act in the silk gland to increase silk-cocoon yield. We highlighted a novel case in which artificial selection could directly act on a nitrogen resource protein associated with a human-desired domestication trait.

"The collagen binding integrin α2β1 plays a crucial role in hemostasis, fibrosis, and cancer progression amongst others. It is specifically inhibited by rhodocetin (RC), a C-type lectin-related protein (CLRP) found in Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma) venom. The structure of RC alone reveals a heterotetramer arranged as an αβ and γδ subunit in a cruciform shape. RC specifically binds to the collagen binding A-domain of the integrin α2 subunit, thereby blocking collagen-induced platelet aggregation. However, until now, the molecular basis for this interaction has remained unclear. Here, we present the molecular structure of the RCγδ-α2A complex solved to 3.0 Å resolution. Our findings show that RC undergoes a dramatic structural reorganization upon binding to α2β1 integrin. Besides the release of the nonbinding RCαβ tandem, the RCγ subunit interacts with loop 2 of the α2A domain as result of a dramatic conformational change. The RCδ subunit contacts the integrin α2A domain in the “closed” conformation through its helix C. Combined with epitope-mapped antibodies, conformationally locked α2A domain mutants, point mutations within the α2A loop 2, and chemical modifications of the purified toxin protein, this molecular structure of RCγδ-α2A complex explains the inhibitory mechanism and specificity of RC for α2β1 integrin.
","In animals, collagen-mediated platelet aggregation is an essential component of the blood’s clotting response following vascular injury. A small group of snake venom toxins belonging to the C-type lectin protein family exert their harmful effects by directly targeting this pathway. Rhodocetin (RC) is a heterotetrameric protein found in the venom of the Malayan pit viper (C. rhodostoma). RC specifically binds α2β1 integrin, the key protein required for collagen-mediated platelet aggregation. In this study, we describe the interaction between RC and α2β1 integrin at atomic resolution. This study reveals that RC undergoes a massive structural reorganization upon α2β1 integrin binding, such that RC’s αβ subunit is released from its γδ subunit and a γδ-α2β1 integrin complex is formed. The inhibitory nature of this complex can be readily explained as RC binding along the top surface of the α2β1 integrin and directly above the collagen binding site. As a result, access of collagen to its binding site is blocked, thereby preventing collagen-mediated platelet aggregation.

"Intracellular acting protein exotoxins produced by bacteria and plants are important molecular determinants that drive numerous human diseases. A subset of these toxins, the cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs), are encoded by several Gram-negative pathogens and have been proposed to enhance virulence by allowing evasion of the immune system. CDTs are trafficked in a retrograde manner from the cell surface through the Golgi apparatus and into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before ultimately reaching the host cell nucleus. However, the mechanism by which CDTs exit the ER is not known. Here we show that three central components of the host ER associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, Derlin-2 (Derl2), the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Hrd1, and the AAA ATPase p97, are required for intoxication by some CDTs. Complementation of Derl2-deficient cells with Derl2:Derl1 chimeras identified two previously uncharacterized functional domains in Derl2, the N-terminal 88 amino acids and the second ER-luminal loop, as required for intoxication by the CDT encoded by Haemophilus ducreyi (Hd-CDT). In contrast, two motifs required for Derlin-dependent retrotranslocation of ERAD substrates, a conserved WR motif and an SHP box that mediates interaction with the AAA ATPase p97, were found to be dispensable for Hd-CDT intoxication. Interestingly, this previously undescribed mechanism is shared with the plant toxin ricin. These data reveal a requirement for multiple components of the ERAD pathway for CDT intoxication and provide insight into a Derl2-dependent pathway exploited by retrograde trafficking toxins.
","Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are produced by several bacterial pathogens and increase the ability of these bacteria to cause disease. After being taken up by host cells, CDTs are trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they must translocate across the ER membrane to gain access to their intracellular target; however, this translocation process is poorly understood for CDTs. Here we provide evidence that CDTs require components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a normal cellular process utilized to translocate terminally misfolded ER lumenal and membrane proteins across the ER membrane for degradation in the cytosol. Deletion of a key member of this pathway, Derl2, makes cells resistant to multiple CDTs. Interestingly, two domains within Derl2 which are required for ERAD of misfolded proteins are dispensable for intoxication by CDT. Further, we report two previously uncharacterized domains within Derl2 that are each required for intoxication. Consistent with a role of Derl2, abrogation of two other members of the ERAD pathway, Hrd1 and p97, results in retention of CDT in the ER and resistance to intoxication. Taken together, these data provide novel insight into how CDTs exit the ER and therefore gain access to their cellular targets.

"The only available vaccine that could be potentially beneficial against mycobacterial diseases contains live attenuated bovine tuberculosis bacillus (Mycobacterium bovis) also called Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Even though the BCG vaccine is still widely used, results on its effectiveness in preventing mycobacterial diseases are partially contradictory, especially regarding Buruli Ulcer Disease (BUD). The aim of this case-control study is to evaluate the possible protective effect of BCG vaccination on BUD.
The present study was performed in three different countries and sites where BUD is endemic: in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, and Togo from 2010 through 2013. The large study population was comprised of 401 cases with laboratory confirmed BUD and 826 controls, mostly family members or neighbors.
After stratification by the three countries, two sexes and four age groups, no significant correlation was found between the presence of BCG scar and BUD status of individuals. Multivariate analysis has shown that the independent variables country (p = 0.31), sex (p = 0.24), age (p = 0.96), and presence of a BCG scar (p = 0.07) did not significantly influence the development of BUD category I or category II/III. Furthermore, the status of BCG vaccination was also not significantly related to duration of BUD or time to healing of lesions.
In our study, we did not observe significant evidence of a protective effect of routine BCG vaccination on the risk of developing either BUD or severe forms of BUD. Since accurate data on BCG strains used in these three countries were not available, no final conclusion can be drawn on the effectiveness of BCG strain in protecting against BUD. As has been suggested for tuberculosis and leprosy, well-designed prospective studies on different existing BCG vaccine strains are needed also for BUD.
","After tuberculosis and leprosy, Buruli Ulcer Disease (BUD) is the third most common human mycobacterial disease.

"Laboratory-based studies have highlighted that pooling stool and urine samples can reduce costs and diagnostic burden without a negative impact on the ability to estimate the intensity of soil-transmitted helminth (STH, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms) and schistosome infections (Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium). In this study, we compare individual and pooled stool examination strategies in a programmatic setting.
Stool samples were collected from 2,650 children in 53 primary schools in Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia, during the national mapping of STHs and schistosome infections. Eggs of STHs and S. mansoni were quantified in both individual and pooled samples (pools were made from 10 individual samples) using a single Kato-Katz smear.
A pooled diagnostic examination strategy provided comparable estimates of infection intensity with higher fecal egg count (expressed in eggs per gram of stool (EPG)) than those based on individual strategy (Ascaris: 45.1 EPG vs. 93.9, p = 0.03; Trichuris: 1.8 EPG vs. 2.1 EPG, p = 0.95; hookworms: 17.5 EPG vs. 28.5 EPG, p = 0.18; S. mansoni: 1.6 EPG vs. 3.4 EPG, p = 0.02), but had lower sensitivity (Ascaris: 90.0% vs. 55.0%; Trichuris: 91.7% vs. 16.7%; hookworms: 92.6% vs. 61.8%; S. mansoni: 100% vs. 51.7%, p < 0.001). A pooled approach resulted in a ~70% reduction in time required for sample testing, but reduced total operational costs by only ~11%.
A pooled approach holds promise for the rapid assessment of intensity of helminth infections in a programmatic setting, but it is not major cost-saving strategy. Further investigation is required to determine when and how pooling can be utilized. Such work should also include validation of statistical methods to estimate prevalence based on pooling samples. Finally, the comparison of operational costs across different scenarios of national program management will help determine whether pooling is indeed worthwhile considering.
","Infections with intestinal (roundworms, whipworm and hookworms) and blood-dwelling (schistosomes) worms pose a significant public health burden in developing tropical countries. To optimize control programs against these worms, large-scale surveys are required to determine the worm distribution to initiate control and to monitor the success of the programs. These large-scale surveys come at an important cost for governments, which in resource-limited countries present major challenges. During a nationwide survey in Ethiopia, we assessed whether the examination of pooled rather than individual samples could be a cost-saving strategy to assess prevalence and intensity of worm infections (which is an indicator of worm-related morbidity and success of the control program). We showed that a pooled examination strategy was useful in estimating the intensity of worm infections, but that it underestimated prevalence. Examination of pooled samples significantly reduced laboratory time, but it only resulted in limited financial gain.

"The host protein viperin is an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) that is up-regulated during a number of viral infections. In this study we have shown that dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) infection significantly induced viperin, co-incident with production of viral RNA and via a mechanism requiring retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Viperin did not inhibit DENV-2 entry but DENV-2 RNA and infectious virus release was inhibited in viperin expressing cells. Conversely, DENV-2 replicated to higher tires earlier in viperin shRNA expressing cells. The anti-DENV effect of viperin was mediated by residues within the C-terminal 17 amino acids of viperin and did not require the N-terminal residues, including the helix domain, leucine zipper and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) motifs known to be involved in viperin intracellular membrane association. Viperin showed co-localisation with lipid droplet markers, and was co-localised and interacted with DENV-2 capsid (CA), NS3 and viral RNA. The ability of viperin to interact with DENV-2 NS3 was associated with its anti-viral activity, while co-localisation of viperin with lipid droplets was not. Thus, DENV-2 infection induces viperin which has anti-viral properties residing in the C-terminal region of the protein that act to restrict early DENV-2 RNA production/accumulation, potentially via interaction of viperin with DENV-2 NS3 and replication complexes. These anti-DENV-2 actions of viperin show both contrasts and similarities with other described anti-viral mechanisms of viperin action and highlight the diverse nature of this unique anti-viral host protein.
","Viperin is a virally induced host protein that has been previously shown to have antiviral activity against a variety of viruses. Here we have demonstrated that viperin is also anti-viral against the medically significant arbovirus, dengue virus. Viperin was able to inhibit dengue virus at the level of viral replication, and cell lines unable to produce normal levels of viperin grew the virus to higher titres. These anti-dengue effects of viperin were mediated by amino acid residues in its C-terminus, and did not require structural domains of the N-terminal region as has been previously shown by us and others for the related virus, hepatitis C virus. Viperin was also demonstrated to co-localise and interact with the dengue capsid protein on the surface of lipid droplets, as well as with the NS3 protein and viral RNA. Viperin's association with NS3 was further demonstrated to be involved in its anti-dengue activities. The anti-viral activities of viperin presented in this manuscript show both similarities and contrasts with other described anti-viral mechanisms for the protein and highlight the diverse nature of this unique anti-viral host protein.

"Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS), an autosomal recessive genetic instability syndrome, is caused by hypomorphic mutation of the NBN gene, which codes for the protein nibrin. Nibrin is an integral member of the MRE11/RAD50/NBN (MRN) complex essential for processing DNA double-strand breaks. Cardinal features of NBS are immunodeficiency and an extremely high incidence of hematological malignancies. Recent studies in conditional null mutant mice have indicated disturbances in redox homeostasis due to impaired DSB processing. Clearly this could contribute to DNA damage, chromosomal instability, and cancer occurrence. Here we show, in the complete absence of nibrin in null mutant mouse cells, high levels of reactive oxygen species several hours after exposure to a mutagen. We show further that NBS patient cells, which unlike mouse null mutant cells have a truncated nibrin protein, also have high levels of reactive oxygen after DNA damage and that this increased oxidative stress is caused by depletion of NAD+ due to hyperactivation of the strand-break sensor, Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Both hyperactivation of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and increased ROS levels were reversed by use of a specific Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. The extremely high incidence of malignancy among NBS patients is the result of the combination of a primary DSB repair deficiency with secondary oxidative DNA damage.
","Damage to DNA is extremely dangerous because it can lead to mutations in genes that initiate or accelerate the development of a tumor. Evolution has led to highly complex networks of DNA repair enzymes, which for the majority of individuals are extremely effective in keeping our DNA intact. The devastating consequences of DNA damage are manifested in those individuals in which one or other of the repair pathways is non-functional. Several genetic disorders can be attributed to such DNA repair deficiencies and have the common feature of increased tumor incidence as the major life-threatening symptom. Cancer incidence varies amongst these disorders and is probably highest for the disease Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome, where more than 50% of patients develop a hematological malignancy in childhood. We have sought to understand this extremely high incidence by exploiting cells from a mouse model and cells derived from patients. We find that deficiency in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks leads to disturbances in cellular metabolism, leading ultimately to a loss of antioxidative capacity. The ensuing accumulation of highly reactive oxygen species generates further DNA lesions, thus potentiating the initial damage and increasing the likelihood of malignancy.

"About 8% of the human genome is made up of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Though most human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are thought to be irrelevant to our biology notable exceptions include members of the HERV-H family that are necessary for the correct functioning of stem cells. ERVs are commonly found in two forms, the full-length proviral form, and the more numerous solo-LTR form, thought to result from homologous recombination events. Here we introduce a phylogenetic framework to study ERV insertion and solo-LTR formation. We then apply the framework to site patterns sampled from a set of long alignments covering six primate genomes. Studying six categories of ERVs we quantitatively recapitulate patterns of insertional activity that are usually described in qualitative terms in the literature. A slowdown in most ERV groups is observed but we suggest that HERV-K activity may have increased in humans since they diverged from chimpanzees. We find that the rate of solo-LTR formation decreases rapidly as a function of ERV age and that an age dependent model of solo-LTR formation describes the history of ERVs more accurately than the commonly used exponential decay model. We also demonstrate that HERV-H loci are markedly less likely to form solo-LTRs than ERVs from other families. We conclude that the slower dynamics of HERV-H suggest a host role for the internal regions of these exapted elements and posit that in future it will be possible to use the relationship between full-length proviruses and solo-LTRs to help identify large scale co-options in distant vertebrate genomes.
","Animal genomes contain ancient pathogens known as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Though the widespread abundance of ERVs is due to their ability to self replicate, some ERVs are known to have become important to host processes including placentation, and in the case of HERV-H, the functioning of human stem cells. In our study we place the insertion and deletion activity of primate ERV families in direct quantitative comparison. In particular, we show that ERV deletion is an age dependent process, so that as an ERV ages it becomes less likely to be deleted at any given instant. We also find that ERVs from the HERV-H family are unusually slowly deleted, an interesting result that suggests that the exaptation of HERV-H may have involved internal regions of the virus and not just its terminal promoters. Assuming the behaviour of primate ERVs is not unusual, our study suggests that future bioinformatics screening for ERVs with slow deletion dynamics could help identify large-scale exaptations in distant species. Furthermore, as we demonstrate that ERVs are deleted rapidly, we think that such screening could be performed using ratios of conserved to deleted elements and could therefore be applied to single genomes.

"Muscles must maintain cell compartmentalization when remodeled during development and use. How spatially restricted adhesions are regulated with muscle remodeling is largely unexplored. We show that the myotubularin (mtm) phosphoinositide phosphatase is required for integrin-mediated myofiber attachments in Drosophila melanogaster, and that mtm-depleted myofibers exhibit hallmarks of human XLMTM myopathy. Depletion of mtm leads to increased integrin turnover at the sarcolemma and an accumulation of integrin with PI(3)P on endosomal-related membrane inclusions, indicating a role for Mtm phosphatase activity in endocytic trafficking. The depletion of Class II, but not Class III, PI3-kinase rescued mtm-dependent defects, identifying an important pathway that regulates integrin recycling. Importantly, similar integrin localization defects found in human XLMTM myofibers signify conserved MTM1 function in muscle membrane trafficking. Our results indicate that regulation of distinct phosphoinositide pools plays a central role in maintaining cell compartmentalization and attachments during muscle remodeling, and they suggest involvement of Class II PI3-kinase in MTM-related disease.
","Muscles require strong extracellular attachments to preserve cellular integrity during force-generating contractions. Integrin transmembrane receptors mediate muscle attachments at highly localized sites, but how this pattern of attachments is continuously maintained with muscle use is not understood. Human X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a frequently fatal muscle disease, is associated with mutations in the MTM1 lipid regulator. Myotubularin (MTM) lipid phosphatases are implicated in endocytosis, a process of cellular uptake that can traffic transmembrane receptors for redelivery to the plasma membrane or to protein destruction. Here, we address MTM roles in muscle, using the genetically tractable fruit fly for detailed investigation of muscle cellular organization and functions. We show that fly muscle cells depleted for mtm function exhibit hallmarks of human XLMTM. We found that mtm regulates integrin localization through endocytosis and, in this role, is needed to maintain muscle attachments. Co-depletion of Class II PI3-kinase with mtm restores normal integrin localization at muscle attachment sites and fly survival, identifying a potential therapy target in MTM-related disease. Importantly, we show that integrin localization is also disrupted in human XLMTM. Our work shows conservation of MTM function in integrin trafficking and reveals insights into regulation of muscle cell maintenance and human disease.

"Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF), caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, is the tick-borne disease that generates the largest number of human deaths in the world. In Brazil, the current increase of BSF human cases has been associated with the presence and expansion of capybaras Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, which act as primary hosts for the tick Amblyomma sculptum, vector of the R. rickettsii in this area.
We proposed a semi-discrete-time stochastic model to evaluate the role of capybaras in the transmission dynamics of R. rickettsii. Through a sensitivity analysis, we identified the parameters with significant influence on the R. rickettsii establishment. Afterward, we implemented the Gillespie’s algorithm to simulate the impact of potential public health interventions to prevent BSF human cases.
The introduction of a single infected capybara with at least one infected attached tick is enough to trigger the disease in a non-endemic area. We found that to avoid the formation of new BSF-endemic areas, it is crucial to impede the emigration of capybaras from endemic areas by reducing their birth rate by more than 58%. Model results were corroborated by ex-situ data generated from field studies, and this supports our proposal to prevent BSF human cases by implementing control strategies focused on capybaras.
The proposed stochastic model illustrates how strategies for the control and prevention of vector-borne infectious diseases can be focused on amplifier hosts management practices. This work provides a basis for future prevention strategies for other neglected vector-borne diseases.
","A stochastic model for the spread of R. rickettsii among the Amblyomma sculptum tick vector and the Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, amplifier host, was formulated. We found that the introduction of a single infected capybara, with at least one infected attached tick, is enough to trigger the disease in a non-endemic area. To avoid disease propagation, it is crucial to impede the emigration of capybaras from endemic areas by keeping the population in a stable state. Otherwise, to eliminate the disease from endemic areas, a reduction by more than 58% in the capybara birth rate is necessary. These results allow improving the planning of public actions to prevent Brazilian Spotted fever based on the control of capybara population and provided a basis for planning prevention programs for other neglected vector-borne diseases.

"The cytosol is the major environment in all bacterial cells. The true physical and dynamical nature of the cytosol solution is not fully understood and here a modeling approach is applied. Using recent and detailed data on metabolite concentrations, we have created a molecular mechanical model of the prokaryotic cytosol environment of Escherichia coli, containing proteins, metabolites and monatomic ions. We use 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations to compute diffusion rates, the extent of contact between molecules and dielectric constants. Large metabolites spend ∼80% of their time in contact with other molecules while small metabolites vary with some only spending 20% of time in contact. Large non-covalently interacting metabolite structures mediated by hydrogen-bonds, ionic and π stacking interactions are common and often associate with proteins. Mg2+ ions were prominent in NIMS and almost absent free in solution. Κ+ is generally not involved in NIMSs and populates the solvent fairly uniformly, hence its important role as an osmolyte. In simulations containing ubiquitin, to represent a protein component, metabolite diffusion was reduced owing to long lasting protein-metabolite interactions. Hence, it is likely that with larger proteins metabolites would diffuse even more slowly. The dielectric constant of these simulations was found to differ from that of pure water only through a large contribution from ubiquitin as metabolite and monatomic ion effects cancel. These findings suggest regions of influence specific to particular proteins affecting metabolite diffusion and electrostatics. Also some proteins may have a higher propensity for associations with metabolites owing to their larger electrostatic fields. We hope that future studies may be able to accurately predict how binding interactions differ in the cytosol relative to dilute aqueous solution.
","The cytosol is the major cellular environment housing the majority of cellular activity. Although the cytosol is an aqueous environment, it contains high concentrations of ions, metabolites, and proteins, making it very different from dilute aqueous solution, which is frequently used for in vitro biochemistry. Recent advances in metabolomics have provided detailed concentration data for metabolites in E.coli. We used this information to construct accurate atomistic models of the cytosol solution. We find that, unlike the situation in dilute solutions, most metabolites spend the majority of their time in contact with other metabolites, or in contact with proteins. Furthermore, we find large non-covalently interacting metabolite structures are common and often associated with proteins. The presence of proteins reduced metabolite diffusion owing to long lasting correlations of motion. The dielectric constant of these simulations was found to differ from that of pure water only through a large contribution from proteins as metabolite and monatomic ion effects largely cancel. These findings suggest specific protein spheres of influence affecting metabolite diffusion and the electrostatic environment.

"New vector control paradigms expanding the use of spatial repellents are promising, but there are many gaps in our knowledge about how repellents work and how their long-term use might affect vector populations over time. Reported here are findings from a series of in vitro studies that investigated the plasticity and heritability of spatial repellent (SR) behaviors in Aedes aegypti exposed to airborne transfluthrin, including results that indicate a possible link between repellent insensitivity and insecticide resistance.
A dual-choice chamber system was used to observe directional flight behaviors in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes exposed to passively emanating transfluthrin vapors (1.35 mg/m3). Individual SR responder and SR non-responder mosquitoes were identified, collected and maintained separately according to their observed phenotype. Subsequent testing included re-evaluation of behavioral responses in some mosquito cohorts as well as testing the progeny of selectively bred responder and non-responder mosquito strains through nine generations. At baseline (F0 generation), transfluthrin actively repelled mosquitoes in the assay system. F0 mosquitoes repelled upon initial exposure to transfluthrin vapors were no more likely to be repelled again by subsequent exposure 24h later, but repelled mosquitoes allowed to rest for 48h were subsequently repelled at a higher proportion than was observed at baseline. Selective breeding of SR responders for nine generations did not change the proportion of mosquitoes repelled in any generation. However, selective breeding of SR non-responders did produce, after four generations, a strain of mosquitoes that was insensitive to the SR activity of transfluthrin. Compared to the SR responder strain, the SR insensitive strain also demonstrated decreased susceptibility to transfluthrin toxicity in CDC bottle bioassays and a higher frequency of the V1016Ikdr mutation.
SR responses to volatile transfluthrin are complex behaviors with multiple determinants in Ae. aegypti. Results indicate a role for neurotoxic irritation of mosquitoes by sub-lethal doses of airborne chemical as a mechanism by which transfluthrin can produce SR behaviors in mosquitoes. Accordingly, how prolonged exposure to sub-lethal doses of volatile pyrethroids might impact insecticide resistance in natural vector populations, and how already resistant populations might respond to a given repellent in the field, are important considerations that warrant further monitoring and study. Results also highlight the critical need to develop new repellent active ingredients with novel mechanisms of action.
","There is growing evidence to support the expanded use of spatial repellents for vector control, but there are still many uncertainties about how repellents work and how their long term use may impact vector populations over time. Here, we conducted a series of in vitro experiments that investigated spatial repellent (SR) behaviors in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes exposed to airborne transfluthrin, a volatile pyrethroid commonly used in repellent products. We were able to show that repellent insensitivity is linked to reduced insecticide susceptibility and increased knock down resistance allele frequency, indicating that sub-lethal doses of airborne transfluthrin can elicit SR behaviors in mosquitoes by inducing an agitated state via neurotoxic pathways independent of olfactory stimulation. This raises questions about how the use of volatile pyrethroid repellents may impact insecticide resistance in target vectors over time, highlighting the need to further understand all of the physiological drivers of SR behaviors and emphasizing the requirement to develop new repellent active ingredients with novel, non-toxic mechanisms of action.

"Recent discoveries of direct acting antivirals against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) have raised hopes of effective treatment via combination therapies. Yet rapid evolution and high diversity of HCV populations, combined with the reality of suboptimal treatment adherence, make drug resistance a clinical and public health concern. We develop a general model incorporating viral dynamics and pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics to assess how suboptimal adherence affects resistance development and clinical outcomes. We derive design principles and adaptive treatment strategies, identifying a high-risk period when missing doses is particularly risky for de novo resistance, and quantifying the number of additional doses needed to compensate when doses are missed. Using data from large-scale resistance assays, we demonstrate that the risk of resistance can be reduced substantially by applying these principles to a combination therapy of daclatasvir and asunaprevir. By providing a mechanistic framework to link patient characteristics to the risk of resistance, these findings show the potential of rational treatment design.
","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects approximately 170 million people world-wide and chronic infections can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. New combination therapies of direct acting antivirals have achieved remarkably high cure rates in clinical trials. However, high mutation rates and high diversity of HCV populations, combined with the reality of suboptimal treatment adherence, make drug resistance a clinical and public health concern. By constructing a mechanistic framework to assess the risk of drug resistance, we provide guidelines for rational design and adaptive management of these promising new therapies. In particular, we identify a high-risk period when missing doses is particularly risky, and quantify the number of extra doses needed to compensate when doses are missed. This framework is a step towards developing a tool for clinicians to design combination therapies and adaptively manage treatment regimens to achieve favorable clinical outcomes.

"The breast cancer suppressor BRCA2 controls the recombinase RAD51 in the reactions that mediate homologous DNA recombination, an essential cellular process required for the error-free repair of DNA double-stranded breaks. The primary mode of interaction between BRCA2 and RAD51 is through the BRC repeats, which are ∼35 residue peptide motifs that interact directly with RAD51 in vitro. Human BRCA2, like its mammalian orthologues, contains 8 BRC repeats whose sequence and spacing are evolutionarily conserved. Despite their sequence conservation, there is evidence that the different human BRC repeats have distinct capacities to bind RAD51. A previously published crystal structure reports the structural basis of the interaction between human BRC4 and the catalytic core domain of RAD51. However, no structural information is available regarding the binding of the remaining seven BRC repeats to RAD51, nor is it known why the BRC repeats show marked variation in binding affinity to RAD51 despite only subtle sequence variation. To address these issues, we have performed fluorescence polarisation assays to indirectly measure relative binding affinity, and applied computational simulations to interrogate the behaviour of the eight human BRC-RAD51 complexes, as well as a suite of BRC cancer-associated mutations. Our computational approaches encompass a range of techniques designed to link sequence variation with binding free energy. They include MM-PBSA and thermodynamic integration, which are based on classical force fields, and a recently developed approach to computing binding free energies from large-scale quantum mechanical first principles calculations with the linear-scaling density functional code onetep. Our findings not only reveal how sequence variation in the BRC repeats directly affects affinity with RAD51 and provide significant new insights into the control of RAD51 by human BRCA2, but also exemplify a palette of computational and experimental tools for the analysis of protein-protein interactions for chemical biology and molecular therapeutics.
","The atomic scale interactions that occur at the interfaces between proteins are fundamental to all biological processes. One such critical interface is formed between the proteins, human BRCA2 and RAD51. BRCA2 binds to and delivers RAD51 to sites of DNA damage, where RAD51 mediates the error-free repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Mutations in BRCA2 have been linked to breast cancer predisposition. Therefore, an accurate picture of the interactions between these two proteins is of great importance. BRCA2 interacts with RAD51 via eight “BRC repeats” that are similar, but not identical, in sequence. Due to lack of experimental structural information regarding the binding of seven of the eight BRC repeats to RAD51, it is unknown how subtle sequence variations in the repeats translate to measurable variations in their binding affinity. We have used a range of computational methods, firstly based on classical force fields, and secondly based on first principles quantum mechanical techniques whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of atoms, allowing us to perform calculations on the entire protein complex. This is the first study comparing all eight BRC repeats at the atomic scale and our results provide critical insights into the control of RAD51 by human BRCA2.

"Contributions of null and hypomorphic alleles of Apc in mice produce both developmental and pathophysiological phenotypes. To ascribe the resulting genotype-to-phenotype relationship unambiguously to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, we challenged the allele combinations by genetically restricting intracellular β-catenin expression in the corresponding compound mutant mice. Subsequent evaluation of the extent of resulting Tcf4-reporter activity in mouse embryo fibroblasts enabled genetic measurement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the form of an allelic series of mouse mutants. Different permissive Wnt signaling thresholds appear to be required for the embryonic development of head structures, adult intestinal polyposis, hepatocellular carcinomas, liver zonation, and the development of natural killer cells. Furthermore, we identify a homozygous Apc allele combination with Wnt/β-catenin signaling capacity similar to that in the germline of the Apcmin mice, where somatic Apc loss-of-heterozygosity triggers intestinal polyposis, to distinguish whether co-morbidities in Apcmin mice arise independently of intestinal tumorigenesis. Together, the present genotype–phenotype analysis suggests tissue-specific response levels for the Wnt/β-catenin pathway that regulate both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
","Germline or somatic mutations in genes are the underlying cause of many human diseases, most notably cancer. Interestingly though, even in situations where every cell of every tissue of an organism carries the same mutation (as is the case for germline mutations), some tissues are more susceptible to the development of disease over time than others. For example, in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), affected persons carry different germline mutations in the APC gene and are prone to developing cancers of the colon and the rectum—and, less frequently, cancers in other tissues such as stomach, liver, and bones. Here we utilize a panel of mutant mice with truncating or hypomorphic mutations in the Apc gene, resulting in different levels of activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our results reveal that different pathophysiological outcomes depend on different permissive signaling thresholds in embryonic, intestinal, and liver tissues. Importantly, we demonstrate that reducing Wnt pathway activation by 50% is enough to prevent the manifestation of embryonic abnormalities and disease in the adult mouse. This raises the possibility of developing therapeutic strategies that modulate the activation levels of this pathway rather than trying to “repair” the mutation in the gene itself.

"Interactions between an organism and its environment can significantly influence
                    phenotypic evolution. A first step toward understanding this process is to
                    characterize phenotypic diversity within and between populations. We explored
                    the phenotypic variation in stress sensitivity and genomic expression in a large
                    panel of Saccharomyces strains collected from diverse
                    environments. We measured the sensitivity of 52 strains to 14 environmental
                    conditions, compared genomic expression in 18 strains, and identified gene
                    copy-number variations in six of these isolates. Our results demonstrate a large
                    degree of phenotypic variation in stress sensitivity and gene expression.
                    Analysis of these datasets reveals relationships between strains from similar
                    niches, suggests common and unique features of yeast habitats, and implicates
                    genes whose variable expression is linked to stress resistance. Using a simple
                    metric to suggest cases of selection, we found that strains collected from oak
                    exudates are phenotypically more similar than expected based on their genetic
                    diversity, while sake and vineyard isolates display more diverse phenotypes than
                    expected under a neutral model. We also show that the laboratory strain S288c is
                    phenotypically distinct from all of the other strains studied here, in terms of
                    stress sensitivity, gene expression, Ty copy number, mitochondrial content, and
                    gene-dosage control. These results highlight the value of understanding the
                    genetic basis of phenotypic variation and raise caution about using laboratory
                    strains for comparative genomics.
","Much attention has been given to the ways in which organisms evolve new
                    phenotypes and the influence of the environment on this process. A major focus
                    of study is defining the genetic basis for phenotypes important for organismal
                    fitness. As a first step toward this goal, we surveyed phenotypic variation in
                    diverse yeast strains collected from different environments by characterizing
                    variations in stress resistance and genomic expression. We uncovered many
                    phenotypic differences across yeast strains, both in stress tolerance and gene
                    expression. The similarities and differences of the strains analyzed uncovered
                    phenotypes shared by strains that live in similar environments, suggesting
                    common features of yeast niches as well as mechanisms that different strains use
                    to thrive in those conditions. We provide evidence that some characteristics of
                    strains isolated from oak tree soil have been selected for, perhaps because of
                    the shared selective pressures imposed by their environment. One theme emerging
                    from our studies is that the laboratory strain of yeast, long used as a model
                    for yeast physiology and basic biology, is aberrant compared to all other
                    strains. This result raises caution about making general conclusions about yeast
                    biology based on a single strain with a specific genetic makeup.

"Co-evolution of transcriptional regulatory proteins and their sites of action has been often hypothesized but rarely demonstrated. Here we provide experimental evidence of such co-evolution in yeast silent chromatin, a finding that emerged from studies of hybrids formed between two closely related Saccharomyces species. A unidirectional silencing incompatibility between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus led to a key discovery: asymmetrical complementation of divergent orthologs of the silent chromatin component Sir4. In S. cerevisiae/S. bayanus interspecies hybrids, ChIP-Seq analysis revealed a restriction against S. cerevisiae Sir4 associating with most S. bayanus silenced regions; in contrast, S. bayanus Sir4 associated with S. cerevisiae silenced loci to an even greater degree than did S. cerevisiae's own Sir4. Functional changes in silencer sequences paralleled changes in Sir4 sequence and a reduction in Sir1 family members in S. cerevisiae. Critically, species-specific silencing of the S. bayanus HMR locus could be reconstituted in S. cerevisiae by co-transfer of the S. bayanus Sir4 and Kos3 (the ancestral relative of Sir1) proteins. As Sir1/Kos3 and Sir4 bind conserved silencer-binding proteins, but not specific DNA sequences, these rapidly evolving proteins served to interpret differences in the two species' silencers presumably involving emergent features created by the regulatory proteins that bind sequences within silencers. The results presented here, and in particular the high resolution ChIP-Seq localization of the Sir4 protein, provided unanticipated insights into the mechanism of silent chromatin assembly in yeast.
","As eukaryotic species evolve, transcriptionally silent portions of their genomes—termed “heterochromatin”—mutate rapidly. To maintain the “off” state of certain genes in silenced regions, regulatory DNA sequences called silencers, which reside within a rapidly mutating region, must co-evolve with the regulatory proteins that bind these sequences to turn off transcription. Although hypothesized to occur widely in nature, such “molecular co-evolution” of genetic regulators has been demonstrated in only a few cases. Unlike previous examples of gene regulatory co-evolution, we found that the transcription factors that bind silencers in two budding yeast species are, in fact, functionally interchangeable, even though the silencers are not. Surprisingly, the Sir1 and Sir4 silencing proteins, which are heterochromatin components that bind the transcription factors rather than the silencer DNA sequences per se, are the proteins engaged in rapid co-evolution with the silencers. Silencer sequences therefore contain additional, evolutionarily labile information directing the assembly of heterochromatin. As mutations in Sir1 and Sir4 over evolutionary time can compensate for changes in the silencers, this “extra information” likely involves cooperative assembly of the transcription factors with the Sir1 and Sir4 “adaptor” proteins. The localization patterns of two species' Sir4 proteins across both species' genomes in interspecies yeast hybrids illuminate unexpected features of heterochromatin structure and assembly.

"Cryptococcus neoformans is a ubiquitous human fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis in predominantly immunocompromised hosts. The fungus is typically haploid, and sexual reproduction involves two individuals with opposite mating types/sexes, α and a. However, the overwhelming predominance of mating type (MAT) α over a in C. neoformans populations limits α–a mating in nature. Recently it was discovered that C. neoformans can undergo same-sex mating under laboratory conditions, especially between α isolates. Whether same-sex mating occurs in nature and contributes to the current population structure was unknown. In this study, natural αADα hybrids that arose by fusion between two α cells of different serotypes (A and D) were identified and characterized, providing definitive evidence that same-sex mating occurs naturally. A novel truncated allele of the mating-type-specific cell identity determinant SXI1α was also identified as a genetic factor likely involved in this process. In addition, laboratory-constructed αADα strains exhibited hybrid vigor both in vitro and in vivo, providing a plausible explanation for their relative abundance in nature despite the fact that AD hybrids are inefficient in meiosis/sporulation and are trapped in the diploid state. These findings provide insights on the origins, genetic mechanisms, and fitness impact of unisexual hybridization in the Cryptococcus population.
","Cryptococcus neoformans is a major cause of fungal meningitis, predominantly in immunocompromised individuals. This fungus has two mating types/sexes, a and α, and mating typically requires two individuals with opposite mating types. It is mysterious why the α mating type is overwhelmingly predominant in nature and how the capacity for sexual reproduction is maintained in a largely unisexual population. We postulated that same-sex mating between α isolates may occur naturally, as it does under laboratory conditions. By analyzing natural Cryptococcus diploid hybrid isolates containing two α alleles of different serotypic origins, this study demonstrates that same-sex mating transpires in nature. The observations that Sxi1α, a sex regulator encoded by the mating type locus, is frequently altered in C. neoformans hybrids but rarely in the haploid population, and that Sxi1α is also altered in the fertile VGIII group of the sibling species C. gattii by a different mutation support the hypothesis that these SXI1α mutations may enhance fertility, possibly in concert with other genomic changes. Our study provides insights on the genetic and environmental factors that play important roles in the evolution of the current population structure of this pathogenic fungus.

"Pathogens can substantially alter gene expression within an infected host depending on metabolic or virulence requirements in different tissues, however, the effect of these alterations on host immunity are unclear. Here we visualized multiple CD4 T cell responses to temporally expressed proteins in Salmonella-infected mice. Flagellin-specific CD4 T cells expanded and contracted early, differentiated into Th1 and Th17 lineages, and were enriched in mucosal tissues after oral infection. In contrast, CD4 T cells responding to Salmonella Type-III Secretion System (TTSS) effectors steadily accumulated until bacterial clearance was achieved, primarily differentiated into Th1 cells, and were predominantly detected in systemic tissues. Thus, pathogen regulation of antigen expression plays a major role in orchestrating the expansion, differentiation, and location of antigen-specific CD4 T cells in vivo.
","Pathogens alter protein expression in an infected host, depending on metabolic or virulence requirements, but the effect of these changes on the immune response is unclear. We identified new class-II epitopes within Salmonella type-III secretion system effector proteins and generated a methodology to visualize endogenous T cells responding to these epitopes. Our study shows that Salmonella flagellin generates a mixed Th1 and Th17 response that contracts early and is enriched in mucosal tissues. In contrast, we found that Salmonella T3SS effectors generate a sustained Th1 response that requires a persisting infection and is enriched in systemic tissues. These data demonstrate that in vivo antigen regulation substantially alters the antigen specificity, helper differentiation, and anatomical location of pathogen-specific CD4 T cells.

"Obesity is a multifactorial disorder with high heritability (50–75%), which is probably higher in early-onset and severe cases. Although rare monogenic forms and several genes and regions of susceptibility, including copy number variants (CNVs), have been described, the genetic causes underlying the disease still remain largely unknown. We searched for rare CNVs (>100kb in size, altering genes and present in <1/2000 population controls) in 157 Spanish children with non-syndromic early-onset obesity (EOO: body mass index >3 standard deviations above the mean at <3 years of age) using SNP array molecular karyotypes. We then performed case control studies (480 EOO cases/480 non-obese controls) with the validated CNVs and rare sequence variants (RSVs) detected by targeted resequencing of selected CNV genes (n = 14), and also studied the inheritance patterns in available first-degree relatives. A higher burden of gain-type CNVs was detected in EOO cases versus controls (OR = 1.71, p-value = 0.0358). In addition to a gain of the NPY gene in a familial case with EOO and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, likely pathogenic CNVs included gains of glutamate receptors (GRIK1, GRM7) and the X-linked gastrin-peptide receptor (GRPR), all inherited from obese parents. Putatively functional RSVs absent in controls were also identified in EOO cases at NPY, GRIK1 and GRPR. A patient with a heterozygous deletion disrupting two contiguous and related genes, SLCO4C1 and SLCO6A1, also had a missense RSV at SLCO4C1 on the other allele, suggestive of a recessive model. The genes identified showed a clear enrichment of shared co-expression partners with known genes strongly related to obesity, reinforcing their role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Our data reveal a higher burden of rare CNVs and RSVs in several related genes in patients with EOO compared to controls, and implicate NPY, GRPR, two glutamate receptors and SLCO4C1 in highly penetrant forms of familial obesity.
","Although there is strong evidence for a high genetic component of obesity, the underlying genetic causes are largely unknown, mostly due to the highly heterogeneous nature of the disorder. In this work, we have focused on the most severe end of the spectrum, severe obesity with early-onset in childhood, which is more likely due to genetic alterations. We screened for rare copy number variation (CNV) a sample of 157 Spanish children with early-onset obesity using molecular karyotypes and then studied the genes altered by CNVs in 480 cases and 480 non-obese controls. We identified a higher burden of gain-type CNVs in cases as well as several CNVs and sequence variants that were specific of the obese population. Interestingly, the genes identified shared co-expression partners with known obesity genes. Among those, the genes encoding the neuropeptide Y (NPY), two glutamate receptors (GRIK1, GRM7), the X-linked gastrin-peptide receptor (GRPR), and the organic anion transporter (SLCO4C1) are novel obesity candidate genes that may contribute to highly penetrant forms of familial obesity.

"Rabies is a fatal viral disease that continues to threaten both human and animal health in endemic countries. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a rabies-endemic country in which dogs are the main reservoir and continue to present health risks for both human and animals throughout the country.
Passive, laboratory–based rabies surveillance was performed for suspected cases of dog rabies in Vientiane Capital during 2010–2016 and eight additional provinces between 2015–2016 using the Direct Fluorescent Antibody Test (DFAT).

There was a significant increase in rabies cases during the dry season (p = 0.004) (November to April; i.e., <100mm of rainfall per month). No significant differences were noted between age, sex, locality of rabies cases.
The use of laboratory-based rabies surveillance is a useful method of monitoring rabies in Lao PDR and should be expanded to other provincial centers, particularly where there are active rabies control programs.
","Rabies is a viral disease that continues to threaten both human and animal health in endemic countries and almost always results in death of the infected individual. In most areas of Southeast Asia, rabies continues to be a major zoonosis with the main source of human cases being dog bites. In this study, we examined the brains of 415 rabies-suspected dogs from Vientiane Capital and some other provinces of Lao PDR during 2010–2016. Overall, rabies was confirmed in 284 cases. We found that there was a significant increase in rabies cases during the dry season (November to April) when monthly rainfall was less than <100mm. The laboratory-based surveillance of rabies in the domestic animal population is an important component of a rabies control program, however it should be used in conjunction with an effective vaccine program.

"The function of neuronal networks relies on selective assembly of synaptic connections during development. We examined how synaptic specificity emerges in the pontocerebellar projection. Analysis of axon-target interactions with correlated light-electron microscopy revealed that developing pontine mossy fibers elaborate extensive cell-cell contacts and synaptic connections with Purkinje cells, an inappropriate target. Subsequently, mossy fiber–Purkinje cell connections are eliminated resulting in granule cell-specific mossy fiber connectivity as observed in mature cerebellar circuits. Formation of mossy fiber-Purkinje cell contacts is negatively regulated by Purkinje cell-derived BMP4. BMP4 limits mossy fiber growth in vitro and Purkinje cell-specific ablation of BMP4 in mice results in exuberant mossy fiber–Purkinje cell interactions. These findings demonstrate that synaptic specificity in the pontocerebellar projection is achieved through a stepwise mechanism that entails transient innervation of Purkinje cells, followed by synapse elimination. Moreover, this work establishes BMP4 as a retrograde signal that regulates the axon-target interactions during development.
","Brain functions rely on highly selective neuronal networks which are assembled during development. Network assembly involves targeted neuronal growth followed by recognition of the appropriate target cells and selective synapse formation. How neuronal processes select their appropriate target cells from an array of interaction partners is poorly understood. In this study, we have addressed this question for the axons emerging from the pontine gray nucleus, a major brainstem nucleus that relays information between the cortex and the cerebellum, a brain area responsible for the control of skilled movements but also emotional processing. Using advanced microscopy techniques, we find that developing mossy fibers establish synaptic contacts rather promiscuously, and elaborate extensive synapses with Purkinje cells, an inappropriate target. These contacts are subsequently eliminated, and proper synaptic connectivity is then restricted to granule and Golgi neurons. We identify bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) as a regulator of these inappropriate mossy fiber-Purkinje cell contacts. BMP growth factors are best known for their functions in cell specification during embryonic development, and our results support an additional retrograde signaling function between axons and their target cells in early postnatal stages. In summary, we show that the specificity of the synaptic connections in the ponto-cerebellar circuit emerges through extensive elimination of transient synapses.

"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the causative agents of cervical cancers. The infectious HPV life cycle is closely linked to the differentiation state of the host epithelia, with viral genome amplification, late gene expression and virion production restricted to suprabasal cells. The E6 and E7 proteins provide an environment conducive to DNA synthesis upon differentiation, but little is known concerning the mechanisms that regulate productive viral genome amplification. Using keratinocytes that stably maintain HPV-31 episomes, and chemical inhibitors, we demonstrate that viral proteins activate the ATM DNA damage response in differentiating cells, as indicated by phosphorylation of CHK2, BRCA1 and NBS1. This activation is necessary for viral genome amplification, as well as for formation of viral replication foci. In contrast, inhibition of ATM kinase activity in undifferentiated keratinocytes had no effect on the stable maintenance of viral genomes. Previous studies have shown that HPVs induce low levels of caspase 3/7 activation upon differentiation and that this is important for cleavage of the E1 replication protein and genome amplification. Our studies demonstrate that caspase cleavage is induced upon differentiation of HPV positive cells through the action of the DNA damage protein kinase CHK2, which may be activated as a result of E7 binding to the ATM kinase. These findings identify a major regulatory mechanism responsible for productive HPV replication in differentiating cells. Our results have potential implications for the development of anti-viral therapies to treat HPV infections.
","Over 100 types of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been identified, and approximately one-third of these infect epithelial cells of the genital mucosa. A subset of these HPV types are the causative agents of cervical and other anogenital cancers. The infectious life cycle of HPV is dependent on differentiation of the host epithelial cell, with viral genome amplification and virion production restricted to differentiated suprabasal cells. While normal keratinocytes exit the cell cycle upon differentiation, HPV positive suprabasal cells are able to re-enter S-phase to mediate productive replication. The mechanisms regulating the activation of differentiation-dependent viral replication are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV induces an ATM-dependent DNA damage response that is essential for viral genome amplification in differentiating cells. In addition, we have found that ATM signaling to its downstream target CHK2 is critical for providing an environment that is conducive to HPV productive replication. Our findings identify an important regulatory mechanism by which HPV controls replication during the productive phase of the life cycle and may identify new targets for the development of therapeutics to treat HPV-induced infections.

"The various roles that aggregation prone regions (APRs) are capable of playing in proteins are investigated here via comprehensive analyses of multiple non-redundant datasets containing randomly generated amino acid sequences, monomeric proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and catalytic residues. Results from this study indicate that the aggregation propensities of monomeric protein sequences have been minimized compared to random sequences with uniform and natural amino acid compositions, as observed by a lower average aggregation propensity and fewer APRs that are shorter in length and more often punctuated by gate-keeper residues. However, evidence for evolutionary selective pressure to disrupt these sequence regions among homologous proteins is inconsistent. APRs are less conserved than average sequence identity among closely related homologues (≥80% sequence identity with a parent) but APRs are more conserved than average sequence identity among homologues that have at least 50% sequence identity with a parent. Structural analyses of APRs indicate that APRs are three times more likely to contain ordered versus disordered residues and that APRs frequently contribute more towards stabilizing proteins than equal length segments from the same protein. Catalytic residues and APRs were also found to be in structural contact significantly more often than expected by random chance. Our findings suggest that proteins have evolved by optimizing their risk of aggregation for cellular environments by both minimizing aggregation prone regions and by conserving those that are important for folding and function. In many cases, these sequence optimizations are insufficient to develop recombinant proteins into commercial products. Rational design strategies aimed at improving protein solubility for biotechnological purposes should carefully evaluate the contributions made by candidate APRs, targeted for disruption, towards protein structure and activity.
","Biotechnology requires the large-scale expression, yield, and storage of recombinant proteins. Each step in protein production has the potential to cause aggregation as proteins, not evolved to exist outside the cell, endure the various steps involved in commercial manufacturing processes. Mechanistic studies into protein aggregation have revealed that certain sequence regions contribute more to the aggregation propensity of a protein than other sequence regions do. Efforts to disrupt these regions have thus far indicated that rational sequence engineering is a useful technique to reduce the aggregation of biotechnologically relevant proteins. To improve our ability to rationally engineer proteins with enhanced expression, solubility, and shelf-life we conducted extensive analyses of aggregation prone regions (APRs) within protein sequences to characterize the various roles these regions play in proteins. Findings from this work indicate that protein sequences have evolved by minimizing their aggregation propensities. However, we also found that many APRs are conserved in protein families and are essential to maintain protein stability and function. Therefore, the contributions that APRs, targeted for disruption, make towards protein stability and function should be carefully evaluated when improving protein solubility via rational design.

"Incoming papillomaviruses (PVs) depend on mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown to gain initial access to the nucleus for viral transcription and replication. In our previous work, we hypothesized that the minor capsid protein L2 of PVs tethers the incoming vDNA to mitotic chromosomes to direct them into the nascent nuclei. To re-evaluate how dynamic L2 recruitment to cellular chromosomes occurs specifically during prometaphase, we developed a quantitative, microscopy-based assay for measuring the degree of chromosome recruitment of L2-EGFP. Analyzing various HPV16 L2 truncation-mutants revealed a central chromosome-binding region (CBR) of 147 amino acids that confers binding to mitotic chromosomes. Specific mutations of conserved motifs (IVAL286AAAA, RR302/5AA, and RTR313EEE) within the CBR interfered with chromosomal binding. Moreover, assembly-competent HPV16 containing the chromosome-binding deficient L2(RTR313EEE) or L2(IVAL286AAAA) were inhibited for infection despite their ability to be transported to intracellular compartments. Since vDNA and L2 were not associated with mitotic chromosomes either, the infectivity was likely impaired by a defect in tethering of the vDNA to mitotic chromosomes. However, L2 mutations that abrogated chromatin association also compromised translocation of L2 across membranes of intracellular organelles. Thus, chromatin recruitment of L2 may in itself be a requirement for successful penetration of the limiting membrane thereby linking both processes mechanistically. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the association of L2 with mitotic chromosomes is conserved among the alpha, beta, gamma, and iota genera of Papillomaviridae. However, different binding patterns point to a certain variance amongst the different genera. Overall, our data suggest a common strategy among various PVs, in which a central region of L2 mediates tethering of vDNA to mitotic chromosomes during cell division thereby coordinating membrane translocation and delivery to daughter nuclei.
","Papillomaviruses can cause carcinogenic malignancies such as cervical cancer. Like most DNA viruses, papillomaviruses must deliver their genome to the cell nucleus during initial infection, where it is expressed and replicated. However, papillomaviruses make use of unconventional mechanisms for genome delivery. They reside on the cell surface for protracted, hour-long times, before they are taken up by a novel endocytic mechanism. Moreover, they are delivered to the trans-Golgi-network by non-canonical endosomal trafficking prior to nuclear delivery. For entry into the nucleus, papillomaviruses access the nuclear space after nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis unlike most other intranuclear viruses. The detailed mechanism how the viral genome is directed to nascent nuclei during mitosis remains elusive. Our previous work suggested that the minor capsid protein L2 may tether the incoming viral genome to mitotic chromosomes to direct it to the nascent nuclei. This work identifies a conserved central region in L2 protein to be necessary and sufficient for tethering. Moreover, it demonstrates that this mechanism is conserved across different papillomavirus genera. Importantly, this report also provides evidence that the processes of nuclear import by tethering and membrane penetration are mechanistically linked.

"Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), is endemic in West Africa, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality. In spite of ongoing research efforts, LF pathogenesis and mechanisms of LASV immune control remain poorly understood. While normal laboratory mice are resistant to LASV, we report that mice expressing humanized instead of murine MHC class I (MHC-I) failed to control LASV infection and develop severe LF. Infection of MHC-I knockout mice confirmed a key role for MHC-I-restricted T cell responses in controlling LASV. Intriguingly we found that T cell depletion in LASV-infected HHD mice prevented disease, irrespective of high-level viremia. Widespread activation of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells, manifest through inducible NO synthase expression, and elevated IL-12p40 serum levels indicated a systemic inflammatory condition. The absence of extensive monocyte/macrophage activation in T cell-depleted mice suggested that T cell responses contribute to deleterious innate inflammatory reactions and LF pathogenesis. Our observations in mice indicate a dual role for T cells, not only protecting from LASV, but also enhancing LF pathogenesis. The possibility of T cell-driven enhancement and immunopathogenesis should be given consideration in future LF vaccine development.
","Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality in West Africa. Yet the mechanisms leading to disease remain poorly understood. Here we propose a concept whereby the body's immune defense either defeats LASV rapidly or, if unsuccessful, becomes an essential facilitator of disease. This latter paradoxical postulate stems from observations in genetically engineered (HHD) mice, which we found to be susceptible to LF. HHD mice differ from resistant wild type mice in that they have a humanized repertoire of T cells, a main component of the mammalian immune system. Counterintuitively, we could protect HHD mice against LF by experimentally removing their T cells. We further found that LF correlated with widespread activation of macrophages, which again depended on T cells. Similar to T cells, macrophages are important players in our body's defense system, but their inflammatory products are also candidate mediators of LF. Taken together, these findings suggest that LF may represent an inappropriate host response to infection. Specifically, our study demonstrates a two-faced role of T cell responses against LASV. Such detrimental aspects of immune defense need to be given consideration in future LF vaccine development, to avoid enhancement of disease in vaccinated individuals.

"Information processing of the cerebellar granular layer composed of granule and Golgi cells is regarded as an important first step toward the cerebellar computation. Our previous theoretical studies have shown that granule cells can exhibit random alternation between burst and silent modes, which provides a basis of population representation of the passage-of-time (POT) from the onset of external input stimuli. On the other hand, another computational study has reported that granule cells can exhibit synchronized oscillation of activity, as consistent with observed oscillation in local field potential recorded from the granular layer while animals keep still. Here we have a question of whether an identical network model can explain these distinct dynamics. In the present study, we carried out computer simulations based on a spiking network model of the granular layer varying two parameters: the strength of a current injected to granule cells and the concentration of Mg2+ which controls the conductance of NMDA channels assumed on the Golgi cell dendrites. The simulations showed that cells in the granular layer can switch activity states between synchronized oscillation and random burst-silent alternation depending on the two parameters. For higher Mg2+ concentration and a weaker injected current, granule and Golgi cells elicited spikes synchronously (synchronized oscillation state). In contrast, for lower Mg2+ concentration and a stronger injected current, those cells showed the random burst-silent alternation (POT-representing state). It is suggested that NMDA channels on the Golgi cell dendrites play an important role for determining how the granular layer works in response to external input.
","Intensive studies of Pavlovian delay eyelid conditioning suggest that the cerebellum can memorize a passage-of-time (POT) from the onset of an external stimulus. To account for possible mechanisms of such POT representation, some network models have been proposed to show that granule cells (grcs) in the cerebellar granular layer can exhibit random alternation of burst and silent modes under feedback inhibition from Golgi cells, resulting in non-recurrent generation of active granule cells populations. On the other hand, the oscillation of local field potential (LFP) has been observed in the cerebellar granular layer when animals stay at rest. Some network models have shown that grcs can elicit synchronous spikes in an oscillatory manner. These qualitatively different neural dynamics of the granular layer raises a question of how they can be accounted for by an identical network in the granular layer. Here we report that grc activities of a biologically plausible spiking network model undergo the state transition between synchronized oscillation and random burst-silent alternation, depending on the activation of NMDA channels on the Golgi cell dendrites and the strength of a current injected to grcs.

"Chronic persistent infections have been associated with T lymphocytes functional impairment. The aim of this study was to compare the activation status, the proliferative potential and the expression of CD28 and CD3ζ chain on T lymphocytes between chronic chagasic patients and uninfected controls.
Forty-two chronic chagasic patients, 28 healthy individuals and 32 non-chagasic cardiomyopathy donors were included. Peripheral blood was marked for CD3, CD4, CD8, HLA-DR, CD28, CD38 and intracellular CD3ζ. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidylester and incubated with T. cruzi lysate or phytohemagglutinin for five days. Cells from 3 healthy controls were incubated with T. cruzi trypomastigotes separated with transwells; and the expression of CD3ζ chain and proliferation index was determined. Heart-infiltrating cells from two chronic chagasic patients were tested for the aforementioned cellular markers. Chagasic patients displayed higher frequencies of CD4+/HLA-DR+/CD38+ (8.1%±6.1) and CD8+/HLA-DR+/CD38+ (19.8±8.9) T cells in comparison with healthy (1.6±1.0; 10.6±8.0) and non-chagasic cardiomyopathy donors (2.9±2.9; 5.8±6.8). Furthermore, the percentage of CD4+ activated T cells was higher in chagasic patients with cardiac involvement. CD8+ T cells proliferation index in chagasic donors (1.7±0.3) was lower when compared with healthy (2.3±0.3) and non-chagasic cardiomyopathy individuals (3.1±1.1). The frequencies of CD4+/CD28+ and CD8+/CD28+ T cells, as well as the CD3ζbright/CD3ζdim% ratios in CD4+ and CD8+ were lower in chagasic patients when compared with both control groups. The CD3ζbright/CD3ζdim% ratio and proliferative indexes for CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased gradually in those cells cultivated with parasites and displayed lower values than those incubated with medium alone. Finally, heart-infiltrating T cells from two T. cruzi infected patients also expressed activation markers and down-regulate CD28 and CD3ζ.
CD8+ T lymphocytes from chagasic donors displayed reduced proliferative capacity, which might be associated with CD3ζ down-regulation and diminished CD28 expression on CD4 T cells.
","In Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, there is an acute onset from which most of the individuals recover if a competent immune response develops. Patients can remain asymptomatic (indeterminate) for many years, but near 30% can develop specific organ damage, mainly the heart. The pathogenesis of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is associated with parasite persistence, inadequate immune response and autoimmunity. Here we explored the bulk T cells response of chronic chagasic patients with and without cardiomyopathy, uninfected controls and patients with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy. T cells from chagasic donors expressed higher levels of activation markers, and their co-expression on CD4+ T cells distinguished those donors with or without cardiac damage. Mitogen-induced proliferation is highly impaired in the CD8+ T cells compartment, and interestingly activated CD8+ T cells are negatively correlated with the CD4+/CD28− population. The expression of the CD3ζ chain and CD28 was also diminished in chagasic patients. Furthermore, in vitro studies with blood mononuclear cells from uninfected donors showed that the indirect contact with live parasite decreased expression of CD3ζ chain and altered the T cell mitogen-induced proliferation. These results suggest a global impairment of the peripheral T cells response, which is probably associated with parasite persistence.

"The Gram-negative soil dwelling bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the etiological agent of melioidosis. The disease is endemic in most parts of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Over last few years, there has been an increase in number of melioidosis cases from India; however the disease epidemiology is less clearly understood. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) is a powerful genotypic method used to characterize the genetic diversity of B. Pseudomallei both within and across the geographic regions.
In this study, MLST analysis was performed on 64 B. pseudomallei clinical isolates. These isolates were obtained between 2008–2014 from southwestern coastal region of India. Broad population patterns of Indian B. pseudomallei isolates in context with isolates of Southeast Asia or global collection was determined using in silico phylogenetic tools.
A total of 32 Sequence types (STs) were reported among these isolates of which 17 STs (53%) were found to be novel. ST1368 was found as group founder and the most predominant genotype (n = 11, 17%). Most of the B. pseudomallei isolates reported in this study (or other Indian isolates available in MLST database) clustered in one major group suggesting clonality in Indian isolates; however, there were a few outliers. When analyzed by measure of genetic differentiation (FST) and other phylogenetic tools (e.g. PHYLOViZ), Indian STs were found closer to Southeast Asian isolates than Australian isolates. The phylogenetic analysis further revealed that within Asian clade, Indian isolates grouped more closely with isolates from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Thailand.
Overall, the results of this study suggest that the Indian B. pseudomallei isolates are closely related with lesser heterogeneity among them and cluster in one major group suggesting clonality of the isolates. However, it appears that there are a few outliers which are distantly related to the majority of Indian STs. Phylogenetic analysis suggest that Indian isolates are closely related to isolates from Southeast Asia, particularly from South Asia.
","Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram negative bacterium, is the causative agent of melioidosis. B. pseudomallei is a soil saprophyte and causes infections in humans by percutaneous inoculation, inhalation or ingestion. Melioidosis is a life threatening disease, which requires prolonged antibiotic treatment and is classically characterized by pneumonia, septicemia and multiple abscesses. Melioidosis is widely prevalent in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Of late it has been reported from tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. The predicted annual global burden of melioidosis is 165,000 cases. B. pseudomallei has been classified as a Category B threat agent by US Center for Disease Control. Melioidosis is an emerging disease in India that affects many regions. Over the past few years, there has been an increase in number of melioidosis cases, mainly from southwestern costal part of India. This study provides new insights into molecular epidemiology of melioidosis in India. By use of multi locus sequence typing (MLST), we show that Indian isolates are closely related and cluster in one major group suggesting clonality of the isolates. We further show that Indian isolates are more closely related to isolates from Asian countries particularly from South Asia.

"CD4+ T cells subsets have a wide range of important helper and regulatory functions in the immune system. Several studies have specifically suggested that circulating effector CD4+ T cells may play a direct role in control of HIV replication through cytolytic activity or autocrine β-chemokine production. However, it remains unclear whether effector CD4+ T cells expressing cytolytic molecules and β-chemokines are present within lymph nodes (LNs), a major site of HIV replication. Here, we report that expression of β-chemokines and cytolytic molecules are enriched within a CD4+ T cell population with high levels of the T-box transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes). This effector population is predominately found in peripheral blood and is limited in LNs regardless of HIV infection or treatment status. As a result, CD4+ T cells generally lack effector functions in LNs, including cytolytic capacity and IFNγ and β-chemokine expression, even in HIV elite controllers and during acute/early HIV infection. While we do find the presence of degranulating CD4+ T cells in LNs, these cells do not bear functional or transcriptional effector T cell properties and are inherently poor to form stable immunological synapses compared to their peripheral blood counterparts. We demonstrate that CD4+ T cell cytolytic function, phenotype, and programming in the peripheral blood is dissociated from those characteristics found in lymphoid tissues. Together, these data challenge our current models based on blood and suggest spatially and temporally dissociated mechanisms of viral control in lymphoid tissues.
","CD4+ T cells have classically been divided into different subsets based on their different abilities to help and regulate specific parts of the immune system. Recent work in the HIV field has demonstrated that HIV-specific CD4+ T cells with unique effector functions, such as cytolytic activity and β-chemokine production, can play a direct role in control of HIV replication. However, HIV infection is generally considered to be a disease centered in lymphoid tissues, where unique CD4+ T helper cell subsets are present to orchestrate the maturation and priming of adaptive immunity. In this study, we identify that two specific transcription factors, T-bet and Eomes, mark cytolytic and β-chemokine producing CD4+ T cells. While this effector CD4+ T cell population is part of immunosurveillance mechanisms in blood, we find that lymph nodes largely lack this effector population–independent of HIV infection or disease progression status. These results indicate that current effector CD4+ T cell mediated correlates of HIV control are limited to blood and not representative of potential correlates of control in lymphoid tissues.

"Sequence-based protein homology detection has been extensively studied and so far the most sensitive method is based upon comparison of protein sequence profiles, which are derived from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of sequence homologs in a protein family. A sequence profile is usually represented as a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and accordingly PSSM-PSSM or HMM-HMM comparison is used for homolog detection. This paper presents a new homology detection method MRFalign, consisting of three key components: 1) a Markov Random Fields (MRF) representation of a protein family; 2) a scoring function measuring similarity of two MRFs; and 3) an efficient ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm aligning two MRFs. Compared to HMM that can only model very short-range residue correlation, MRFs can model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus, encode information for the global 3D structure of a protein family. Consequently, MRF-MRF comparison for remote homology detection shall be much more sensitive than HMM-HMM or PSSM-PSSM comparison. Experiments confirm that MRFalign outperforms several popular HMM or PSSM-based methods in terms of both alignment accuracy and remote homology detection and that MRFalign works particularly well for mainly beta proteins. For example, tested on the benchmark SCOP40 (8353 proteins) for homology detection, PSSM-PSSM and HMM-HMM succeed on 48% and 52% of proteins, respectively, at superfamily level, and on 15% and 27% of proteins, respectively, at fold level. In contrast, MRFalign succeeds on 57.3% and 42.5% of proteins at superfamily and fold level, respectively. This study implies that long-range residue interaction patterns are very helpful for sequence-based homology detection. The software is available for download at http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/download/. A summary of this paper appears in the proceedings of the RECOMB 2014 conference, April 2–5.
","Sequence-based protein homology detection has been extensively studied, but it remains very challenging for remote homologs with divergent sequences. So far the most sensitive methods employ HMM-HMM comparison, which models a protein family using HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and then detects homologs using HMM-HMM alignment. HMM cannot model long-range residue interaction patterns and thus, carries very little information regarding the global 3D structure of a protein family. As such, HMM comparison is not sensitive enough for distantly-related homologs. In this paper, we present an MRF-MRF comparison method for homology detection. In particular, we model a protein family using Markov Random Fields (MRF) and then detect homologs by MRF-MRF alignment. Compared to HMM, MRFs are able to model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus, contains information for the overall 3D structure of a protein family. Consequently, MRF-MRF comparison is much more sensitive than HMM-HMM comparison. To implement MRF-MRF comparison, we have developed a new scoring function to measure the similarity of two MRFs and also an efficient ADMM algorithm to optimize the scoring function. Experiments confirm that MRF-MRF comparison indeed outperforms HMM-HMM comparison in terms of both alignment accuracy and remote homology detection, especially for mainly beta proteins.

"Efficient infection control requires potent T-cell responses at sites of pathogen replication. However, the regulation of T-cell effector function in situ remains poorly understood. Here, we show key differences in the regulation of effector activity between CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells during skin infection with HSV-1. IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells disseminated widely throughout the skin and draining lymph nodes (LN), clearly exceeding the epithelial distribution of infectious virus. By contrast, IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells were only found within the infected epidermal layer of the skin and associated hair follicles. Mechanistically, while various subsets of lymphoid- and skin-derived dendritic cells (DC) elicited IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells responded exclusively to infected epidermal cells directly presenting viral antigen. Notably, uninfected cross-presenting DCs from both skin and LNs failed to trigger IFN-γ production by CD8+ T-cells. Thus, we describe a previously unappreciated complexity in the regulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell effector activity that is subset-specific, microanatomically distinct and involves largely non-overlapping types of antigen-presenting cells (APC).
","HSV-1 is a widely distributed pathogen causing a life-long latent infection associated with periodic bouts of reactivation and severe clinical complications. Adaptive immune responses encompassing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activities are key to both the clearance of infectious virus and the control of latent infection. However, precisely how such T-cell responses are regulated, particularly within acutely infected peripheral tissues, remains poorly understood. Using a mouse model of HSV-1 skin infection, we describe a complex regulation of T-cell responses at the site of acute infection. These responses were subset-specific and anatomically distinct, with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activities being directed to distinct anatomical compartments within the skin. While IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells were broadly distributed, including skin regions a considerable distance away from infected cells, CD8+ T-cell activity was strictly confined to directly infected epithelial compartments. This unexpected spatial segregation was a direct consequence of the involvement of largely non-overlapping types of antigen-presenting cells in driving CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell effector activity. Our results provide novel insights into the cellular regulation of T-cell immunity within peripheral tissues and have the potential to guide the development of T-cell subset-specific approaches for therapeutic and prophylactic intervention in antimicrobial immunity and autoimmunity.

"Deworming HIV-1 infected individuals may delay HIV-1 disease progression. It is important to determine the prevalence and correlates of HIV-1/helminth co-infection in helminth-endemic areas.
HIV-1 infected individuals (CD4>250 cells/ul) were screened for helminth infection at ten sites in Kenya. Prevalence and correlates of helminth infection were determined. A subset of individuals with soil-transmitted helminth infection was re-evaluated 12 weeks following albendazole therapy.
Of 1,541 HIV-1 seropositive individuals screened, 298 (19.3%) had detectable helminth infections. Among individuals with helminth infection, hookworm species were the most prevalent (56.3%), followed by Ascaris lumbricoides (17.1%), Trichuris trichiura (8.7%), Schistosoma mansoni (7.1%), and Stongyloides stercoralis (1.3%). Infection with multiple species occurred in 9.4% of infections. After CD4 count was controlled for, rural residence (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.08–1.81), having no education (RR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.07–2.30), and higher CD4 count (RR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.07–1.73) remained independently associated with risk of helminth infection. Twelve weeks following treatment with albendazole, 32% of helminth-infected individuals had detectable helminths on examination. Residence, education, and CD4 count were not associated with persistent helminth infection.
Among HIV-1 seropositive adults with CD4 counts above 250 cells/mm3 in Kenya, traditional risk factors for helminth infection, including rural residence and lack of education, were associated with co-infection, while lower CD4 counts were not.

","Over one-third of people worldwide are currently infected with parasitic worms. The majority of these infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where over half of the population may be infected with at least one type of parasitic worm. HIV infection is also common in many of these countries, and there is significant geographic overlap in the presence of HIV and worm infection. Several studies have suggested that treatment of worm infections in people with HIV may delay the progression of HIV disease. Treatment has been shown to both decrease levels of the HIV virus in the blood of people with HIV and to increase the number of immune cells (CD4 cells) targeted by HIV. It is important to determine which populations of HIV-infected individuals are at greatest risk of worm infection in order to develop potential interventions for the treatment and prevention of worm infection in HIV-infected individuals. We report findings from a large study examining the prevalence and associated co-factors for worm infection among individuals at ten sites in Kenya.

"The disease phenotype of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the molecular/ biological properties of its prion strain, including the host range and the characteristics of BSE-related disorders, have been extensively studied since its discovery in 1986. In recent years, systematic testing of the brains of cattle coming to slaughter resulted in the identification of at least two atypical forms of BSE. These emerging disorders are characterized by novel conformers of the bovine pathological prion protein (PrPTSE), named high-type (BSE-H) and low-type (BSE-L). We recently reported two Italian atypical cases with a PrPTSE type identical to BSE-L, pathologically characterized by PrP amyloid plaques and known as bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE). Several lines of evidence suggest that BASE is highly virulent and easily transmissible to a wide host range. Experimental transmission to transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP (Tgbov XV) suggested that BASE is caused by a prion strain distinct from the BSE isolate. In the present study, we experimentally infected Friesian and Alpine brown cattle with Italian BSE and BASE isolates via the intracerebral route. BASE-infected cattle developed amyotrophic changes accompanied by mental dullness. The molecular and neuropathological profiles, including PrP deposition pattern, closely matched those observed in the original cases. This study provides clear evidence of BASE as a distinct prion isolate and discloses a novel disease phenotype in cattle.
","For approximately two decades, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), now termed classical BSE (BSE-C), has been regarded as the only and exclusive prion disorder affecting cattle. However, over the last 4 years, two additional bovine prion strains, bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE, also named BSE-L) and BSE-H, have been discovered and characterized in Canada, the United States, Japan, and nine European countries, which applied an active surveillance program on slaughtered cattle. Although a total of 20 BSE-L and 16 BSE-H have been reported to date, the disease phenotype of these conditions remains largely unknown. Intriguingly, recent evidence has been provided that the BSE-C and BASE strains disclose converging properties after transmission to inbred mice. Here, we show that intraspecies transmission of BASE induces a disease phenotype characterized by dullness and progressive amyotrophy, the latter highly suggestive of a motor neuron disorder. This is at variance with the over-reactivity and hypersensitivity, but not muscle changes, observed in BSE-transmitted cattle. This study confirms that BASE and BSE represent two distinct prion disorders in cattle with diverging molecular features and disease phenotypes.

"Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) are life-threatening complications following infection with one of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV). At present, no vaccine or antiviral therapies are available against dengue. Here, we characterized a panel of eight human or mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and their modified variants lacking effector function and dissected the mechanism by which some protect against antibody-enhanced lethal DENV infection. We found that neutralizing modified MAbs that recognize the fusion loop or the A strand epitopes on domains II and III of the envelope protein, respectively, act therapeutically by competing with and/or displacing enhancing antibodies. By analyzing these relationships, we developed a novel in vitro suppression-of-enhancement assay that predicts the ability of modified MAbs to act therapeutically against antibody-enhanced disease in vivo. These studies provide new insight into the biology of DENV pathogenesis and the requirements for antibodies to treat lethal DENV disease.
","The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause the most prevalent mosquito-transmitted viral disease globally, infecting 50–100 million people annually in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide, yet no vaccine or therapy has been licensed to prevent or treat dengue. The greatest risk factor for severe dengue disease is a previous infection with a different serotype, which is thought to be due in part to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) whereby anti-DENV antibodies from a prior infection augment DENV infection of target Fcg receptor (FcgR)-expressing cells. We previously developed a mouse model that demonstrates antibody-enhanced lethal DENV disease and showed that genetically-modified antibodies incapable of interacting with the FcgR eliminate ADE in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we studied a larger panel of modified MAbs that recognize different regions of the DENV envelope protein. While all modified MAbs acted therapeutically to prevent a lethal, virus-only DENV infection, only certain MAbs effectively protected mice following an antibody-enhanced lethal infection. We determined that therapeutically effective MAbs following an ADE infection worked by competing for binding of enhancing antibodies on the DENV virion. Based on this, we designed an in vitro suppression-of-enhancement assay that predicted the ability of modified MAbs to act therapeutically in vivo.

"RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) are related transcriptional silencing mechanisms that target transposable elements (TEs) and repeats to maintain genome stability in plants. RdDM is mediated by small and long noncoding RNAs produced by the plant-specific RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V, respectively. Through a chemical genetics screen with a luciferase-based DNA methylation reporter, LUCL, we found that camptothecin, a compound with anti-cancer properties that targets DNA topoisomerase 1α (TOP1α) was able to de-repress LUCL by reducing its DNA methylation and H3K9me2 levels. Further studies with Arabidopsis top1α mutants showed that TOP1α silences endogenous RdDM loci by facilitating the production of Pol V-dependent long non-coding RNAs, AGONAUTE4 recruitment and H3K9me2 deposition at TEs and repeats. This study assigned a new role in epigenetic silencing to an enzyme that affects DNA topology.
","DNA topoisomerase is an enzyme that releases the torsional stress in DNA generated during DNA replication or transcription. Here, we uncovered an unexpected role of DNA topoisomerase 1α (TOP1α) in the maintenance of genome stability. Eukaryotic genomes are usually littered with transposable elements (TEs) and repeats, which pose threats to genome stability due to their tendency to move or recombine. Mechanisms are in place to silence these elements, such as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) in plants. Two plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, generate small and long noncoding RNAs, respectively, from TEs and repeats. These RNAs then recruit protein factors to deposit DNA methylation or H3K9me2 to silence the loci. In this study, we found that treatment of plants with camptothecin, a TOP1α inhibitor, or loss of function in TOP1α, led to the de-repression of RdDM target loci, which was accompanied by loss of H3K9me2 or DNA methylation. The role of TOP1α in RdDM could be attributed to its promotion of Pol V, but not Pol IV, transcription to generate long noncoding RNAs.

"The acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) is a key receptor for extracellular protons. Although numerous structural and functional studies have been performed on this channel, the structural dynamics underlying the gating mechanism remains unknown. We used normal mode analysis, mutagenesis, and electrophysiological methods to explore the relationship between the inherent dynamics of ASIC1 and its gating mechanism. Here we show that a series of collective motions among the domains and subdomains of ASIC1 correlate with its acid-sensing function. The normal mode analysis result reveals that the intrinsic rotation of the extracellular domain and the collective motions between the thumb and finger induced by proton binding drive the receptor to experience a deformation from the extracellular domain to the transmembrane domain, triggering the channel pore to undergo “twist-to-open” motions. The movements in the transmembrane domain indicate that the likely position of the channel gate is around Leu440. These motion modes are compatible with a wide body of our complementary mutations and electrophysiological data. This study provides the dynamic fundamentals of ASIC1 gating.
","The acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are key receptors for extracellular protons and are becoming increasingly important drug targets. However, their gating mechanism is still not fully understood. The crystallographic structure of the ASIC1 protein provides a clue, but the dynamics of the channel remains to be elucidated. Using computational biology, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophysiological recordings, we investigated the dynamics of ASIC1 gating. Through “normal mode analysis,” we detected a series of collective motions between the beta turn and transmembrane domain, and between the thumb and finger domains, suggesting a deformation pathway related to channel gating. The intrinsic rotation of the extracellular domain and the collective motions between the thumb and finger domains that are induced by proton binding serve to deform the channel from the extracellular to the transmembrane domain, triggering a “twist-to-open” motion of the channel pore. The relationship between the dynamics and the gating mechanism was experimentally confirmed by a series of complementary mutations in ASIC1 and electrophysiological measurements. Our study also indicated that the likely position of the channel gate is around Leu440 within the ASIC1 protein. We propose a clear model correlating the structural dynamics of ASIC1 and its gating mechanism.

"An important function of all organisms is to ensure that their genetic material remains intact and unaltered through generations. This is an extremely challenging task since the cell's DNA is constantly under assault by endogenous and environmental agents. To protect against this, cells have evolved effective mechanisms to recognize DNA damage, signal its presence, and mediate its repair. While these responses are expected to be highly regulated because they are critical to avoid human diseases, very little is known about the regulation of the expression of genes involved in mediating their effects. The Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) is the major DNA–repair process involved in the recognition and removal of UV-mediated DNA damage. Here we use a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays with an intermittent UV-irradiation protocol to investigate the regulation of key players in the DNA–damage recognition step of NER sub-pathways (TCR and GGR). We show an up-regulation in gene expression of CSA and HR23A, which are involved in TCR and GGR, respectively. Importantly, we show that this occurs through a p53 independent mechanism and that it is coordinated by the stress-responsive transcription factor USF-1. Furthermore, using a mouse model we show that the loss of USF-1 compromises DNA repair, which suggests that USF-1 plays an important role in maintaining genomic stability.
","UV is responsible for DNA damage and genetic alterations of key players of the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) machinery promote the development of UV-induced skin cancers. The NER is the major DNA–repair process involved in the recognition and removal of UV-mediated DNA damage. Different factors participating in this DNA repair are essential, and their mutations are associated with severe genetic diseases such as Cockayne Syndrome and Xeroderma Pigmentosum. Here, we show for the first time that the specific regulation of expression in response to UV of two NER factors CSA and HR23A is required to efficiently remove DNA lesions and to maintain genomic stability. We also implicate the USF-1 transcription factor in the regulation of the expression of these factors using in vitro and in vivo models. This finding is particularly important because UV is the major cause of skin cancers and dramatically compromises patients with highly sensitive genetic diseases.

"Fatty acid synthesis in plants occurs in plastids, and thus, export for subsequent acyl editing and lipid assembly in the cytosol and endoplasmatic reticulum is required. Yet, the transport mechanism for plastid fatty acids still remains enigmatic. We isolated FAX1 (fatty acid export 1), a novel protein, which inserts into the chloroplast inner envelope by α-helical membrane-spanning domains. Detailed phenotypic and ultrastructural analyses of FAX1 mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana showed that FAX1 function is crucial for biomass production, male fertility and synthesis of fatty acid-derived compounds such as lipids, ketone waxes, or pollen cell wall material. Determination of lipid, fatty acid, and wax contents by mass spectrometry revealed that endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)-derived lipids decreased when FAX1 was missing, but levels of several plastid-produced species increased. FAX1 over-expressing lines showed the opposite behavior, including a pronounced increase of triacyglycerol oils in flowers and leaves. Furthermore, the cuticular layer of stems from fax1 knockout lines was specifically reduced in C29 ketone wax compounds. Differential gene expression in FAX1 mutants as determined by DNA microarray analysis confirmed phenotypes and metabolic imbalances. Since in yeast FAX1 could complement for fatty acid transport, we concluded that FAX1 mediates fatty acid export from plastids. In vertebrates, FAX1 relatives are structurally related, mitochondrial membrane proteins of so-far unknown function. Therefore, this protein family might represent a powerful tool not only to increase lipid/biofuel production in plants but also to explore novel transport systems involved in vertebrate fatty acid and lipid metabolism.
","Fatty acid synthesis in plants occurs in chloroplasts—the organelle more commonly known for conducting photosynthesis. For subsequent lipid assembly to be possible in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), export of these fatty acids across the chloroplast envelope membranes is required. The mechanism of this transport until now has not been known. We isolated FAX1 (fatty acid export 1), a novel membrane protein in chloroplast inner envelopes. FAX1 function is crucial for biomass production, male fertility, and the synthesis of fatty acid-derived compounds like lipids, waxes, or cell wall material of pollen grains. Whereas ER-derived lipids decreased when FAX1 was missing, levels of plastid-produced lipids increased. FAX1 over-expressing mutants showed the opposite behavior, including an increase of triacyglycerol oils. Because FAX1 could complement for fatty acid transport in yeast, we concluded that FAX1 mediates the export of free fatty acids from chloroplasts. In vertebrates, FAX1 relatives are structurally related proteins of so-far unknown function in mitochondria. This protein family may thus represent a powerful tool not only to increase lipid oil and biofuel production in plants but also to explore novel transport systems in animals.

"Genomic conflict is perplexing because it causes the fitness of a species to decline rather than improve. Many diverse forms of genomic conflict have been identified, but this extant tally may be incomplete. Here, we show that the unusual characteristics of the sex chromosomes can, in principle, lead to a previously unappreciated form of sexual genomic conflict. The phenomenon occurs because there is selection in the heterogametic sex for sex-linked mutations that harm the sex of offspring that does not carry them, whenever there is competition among siblings. This harmful phenotype can be expressed as an antagonistic green-beard effect that is mediated by epigenetic parental effects, parental investment, and/or interactions among siblings. We call this form of genomic conflict sexually antagonistic “zygotic drive”, because it is functionally equivalent to meiotic drive, except that it operates during the zygotic and postzygotic stages of the life cycle rather than the meiotic and gametic stages. A combination of mathematical modeling and a survey of empirical studies is used to show that sexually antagonistic zygotic drive is feasible, likely to be widespread in nature, and that it can promote a genetic “arms race” between the homo- and heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This new category of genomic conflict has the potential to strongly influence other fundamental evolutionary processes, such as speciation and the degeneration of the Y and W sex chromosomes. It also fosters a new genetic hypothesis for the evolution of enigmatic fitness-reducing traits like the high frequency of spontaneous abortion, sterility, and homosexuality observed in humans.
","Our study describes a new form of sexual genomic conflict that operates through the process of antagonistic green-beard effects. Although past theoretical and empirical work indicated that green-beard effects rarely operate in nature, our new theory shows why this conclusion may have to be reevaluated. We integrate modeling analysis with extant empirical work to show that the unique properties of sex chromosomes can lead to a previously unappreciated form of sexual conflict (sexually antagonistic zygotic drive) that may be widespread in nature. It operates through harmful epigenetic parental effects, asymmetrical allocation of parental investment to sons and daughters, and asymmetrical interactions between brothers and sisters. Sexually antagonistic zygotic drive is functionally analogous to meiotic drive except that it operates due to competition among opposite-sex siblings rather than between competing gametes.

"Long interspersed elements (LINEs) are transposable elements that proliferate within eukaryotic genomes, having a large impact on eukaryotic genome evolution. LINEs mobilize via a process called retrotransposition. Although the role of the LINE-encoded protein(s) in retrotransposition has been extensively investigated, the participation of host-encoded factors in retrotransposition remains unclear. To address this issue, we examined retrotransposition frequencies of two structurally different LINEs—zebrafish ZfL2-2 and human L1—in knockout chicken DT40 cell lines deficient in genes involved in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA and in human HeLa cells treated with a drug that inhibits NHEJ. Deficiencies of NHEJ proteins decreased retrotransposition frequencies of both LINEs in these cells, suggesting that NHEJ is involved in LINE retrotransposition. More precise characterization of ZfL2-2 insertions in DT40 cells permitted us to consider the possibility of dual roles for NHEJ in LINE retrotransposition, namely to ensure efficient integration of LINEs and to restrict their full-length formation.
","Long interspersed elements (LINEs) are transposable elements that mobilize and amplify their own copies within eukaryotic genomes. Although LINEs had been considered as “junk” DNA, recent studies have suggested that the LINE-induced alterations of host chromosomes are a major driving force for eukaryotic genome evolution. LINEs mobilize via a mechanism called retrotransposition, in which transcribed LINE RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA that is then integrated into the host chromosome. Although the role of LINE-encoded proteins in retrotransposition has been revealed, the participation of host-encoded proteins has not been well investigated. Here, using knockout chicken DT40 cell lines, we present genetic evidence that the host-encoded proteins involved in repair of DNA double-strand breaks participate in LINE retrotransposition. More precise characterization of LINE insertions in DT40 cells suggested dual roles for these host DNA repair proteins in LINE retrotransposition; one function is required for efficient integration of LINEs and the other restricts their full-length formation.

"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands loci associated with disease risk and quantitative traits, yet most of the variants responsible for risk remain uncharacterized. The majority of GWAS-identified loci are enriched for non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and defining the molecular mechanism of risk is challenging. Many non-coding causal SNPs are hypothesized to alter transcription factor (TF) binding sites as the mechanism by which they affect organismal phenotypes. We employed an integrative genomics approach to identify candidate TF binding motifs that confer breast cancer-specific phenotypes identified by GWAS. We performed de novo motif analysis of regulatory elements, analyzed evolutionary conservation of identified motifs, and assayed TF footprinting data to identify sequence elements that recruit TFs and maintain chromatin landscape in breast cancer-relevant tissue and cell lines. We identified candidate causal SNPs that are predicted to alter TF binding within breast cancer-relevant regulatory regions that are in strong linkage disequilibrium with significantly associated GWAS SNPs. We confirm that the TFs bind with predicted allele-specific preferences using CTCF ChIP-seq data. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer patient data to identify ANKLE1 and ZNF404 as the target genes of candidate TF binding site SNPs in the 19p13.11 and 19q13.31 GWAS-identified loci. These SNPs are associated with the expression of ZNF404 and ANKLE1 in breast tissue. This integrative analysis pipeline is a general framework to identify candidate causal variants within regulatory regions and TF binding sites that confer phenotypic variation and disease risk.
","The promise of effective personalized medicine is dependent upon the ability to identify genetic variants in the population that influence disease risk and then use this information to accurately predict the likelihood of disease incidence for individual patients. High-risk individuals may be entered into clinical trails, pre-clinical intervention strategies, or increased frequency of screening to detect early disease onset. However, the contribution of any one genetic variant to increase disease susceptibility is typically small, with many potential causal variants in the genomic region associated with risk. Therefore, it is important to understand the biological mechanisms by which the variants within a genetic region influence disease susceptibility by refining the set of all variants to those that are highly plausible to be causal. Herein, we describe a method to integrate molecular genomics data with genetic epidemiological data to inform on the underlying molecular mechanisms that influence breast cancer risk. This approach identifies the important transcription factors that directly regulate gene expression to modulate disease susceptibility.

"Coordination of fetal maturation with birth timing is essential for mammalian reproduction. In humans, preterm birth is a disorder of profound global health significance. The signals initiating parturition in humans have remained elusive, due to divergence in physiological mechanisms between humans and model organisms typically studied. Because of relatively large human head size and narrow birth canal cross-sectional area compared to other primates, we hypothesized that genes involved in parturition would display accelerated evolution along the human and/or higher primate phylogenetic lineages to decrease the length of gestation and promote delivery of a smaller fetus that transits the birth canal more readily. Further, we tested whether current variation in such accelerated genes contributes to preterm birth risk. Evidence from allometric scaling of gestational age suggests human gestation has been shortened relative to other primates. Consistent with our hypothesis, many genes involved in reproduction show human acceleration in their coding or adjacent noncoding regions. We screened >8,400 SNPs in 150 human accelerated genes in 165 Finnish preterm and 163 control mothers for association with preterm birth. In this cohort, the most significant association was in FSHR, and 8 of the 10 most significant SNPs were in this gene. Further evidence for association of a linkage disequilibrium block of SNPs in FSHR, rs11686474, rs11680730, rs12473870, and rs1247381 was found in African Americans. By considering human acceleration, we identified a novel gene that may be associated with preterm birth, FSHR. We anticipate other human accelerated genes will similarly be associated with preterm birth risk and elucidate essential pathways for human parturition.
","The control of birth timing in humans is the greatest unresolved question in reproductive biology, and preterm birth is the most important medical issue in maternal and child health. To begin to address this critical problem, we test the hypothesis that genes accelerated in their rate of evolution in humans, as compared with other primates and mammals, are involved in birth timing. We first show that human gestational length has been altered relative to other non-human primates and mammals. Using allometric scaling, we demonstrate that human gestation is shorter than predicted based upon gestational length in other mammalian species. Next, we show that genes with rate acceleration in humans—in coding or regulatory regions—are plausible candidates to be involved in birth timing. Finally, we find that polymorphisms in the human accelerated gene (FSHR), not before implicated in the timing for birth, may alter risk for human preterm birth. Our understanding of pathways for birth timing in humans is limited, yet its elucidation remains one of the most important issues in biology and medicine. The evolutionary genetic approach that we apply should be applicable to many human disorders and assist other investigators studying preterm birth.

"Programmed cell death (PCD) mediated by mitochondrial processes has emerged as an important mechanism for plant development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the role of translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol during PCD remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the rice dynamin-related protein 1E (OsDRP1E) negatively regulates PCD by controlling mitochondrial structure and cytochrome c release. We used a map-based cloning strategy to isolate OsDRP1E from the lesion mimic mutant dj-lm and confirmed that the E409V mutation in OsDRP1E causes spontaneous cell death in rice. Pathogen inoculation showed that dj-lm significantly enhances resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens. Functional analysis of the E409V mutation showed that the mutant protein impairs OsDRP1E self-association and formation of a higher-order complex; this in turn reduces the GTPase activity of OsDRP1E. Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed that the E409V mutation impairs localization of OsDRP1E to the mitochondria. The E409V mutation significantly affects the morphogenesis of cristae in mitochondria and causes the abnormal release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytoplasm. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the mitochondria-localized protein OsDRP1E functions as a negative regulator of cytochrome c release and PCD in plants.
","Plants have developed a hypersensitive response (HR) that shows rapid programed cell death (PCD) around the infection site, which in turn limits pathogen invasion and restricts the spread of pathogens. Although many studies reported the characterization of PCD in different pathosystems in the last decade, the molecular mechanisms on how PCD is initiated and how it regulates host resistance are still unclear. Lesion mimic mutants exhibit spontaneous HR-like cell death without pathogen invasion and are ideal genetic materials for dissecting the PCD pathway. In this study, we characterized the lesion mimic gene OsDRP1E that negatively regulates plant PCD through the control of cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Our results suggest that the E409V point mutation in the dynamin-related protein OsDRP1E affects the morphogenesis of mitochondrial cristae that leads to the cytochrome c release into cytoplasm. This study provides new insights into the function of dynamin-related proteins in plant immunity.

"Seasonal epidemics of influenza virus result in ∼36,000 deaths annually in the United States. Current vaccines against influenza virus elicit an antibody response specific for the envelope glycoproteins. However, high mutation rates result in the emergence of new viral serotypes, which elude neutralization by preexisting antibodies. T lymphocytes have been reported to be capable of mediating heterosubtypic protection through recognition of internal, more conserved, influenza virus proteins. Here, we demonstrate using a recombinant influenza virus expressing the LCMV GP33-41 epitope that influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells and virus-specific non-neutralizing antibodies each are relatively ineffective at conferring heterosubtypic protective immunity alone. However, when combined virus-specific CD8 T cells and non-neutralizing antibodies cooperatively elicit robust protective immunity. This synergistic improvement in protective immunity is dependent, at least in part, on alveolar macrophages and/or other lung phagocytes. Overall, our studies suggest that an influenza vaccine capable of eliciting both CD8+ T cells and antibodies specific for highly conserved influenza proteins may be able to provide heterosubtypic protection in humans, and act as the basis for a potential “universal” vaccine.
","Influenza virus continues to pose a significant risk to global health and is responsible for thousands of deaths each year in the United States. This threat is largely due to the ability of the influenza virus to undergo rapid changes, allowing it to escape from immune responses elicited by previous infections or vaccinations. Certain internal determinants of the influenza virus are largely conserved across different viral strains and represent attractive targets for potential “universal” influenza vaccines. Here, we demonstrated that cross-subtype protection against the influenza virus could be obtained through simultaneous priming of multiple arms of the immune response against conserved elements of the influenza virus. These results suggest a novel strategy that could potentially form a primary component of a universal influenza vaccine capable of providing long-lasting protection.

"Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8) is required for development, maturation and expression of anti-microbial defenses of myeloid cells. BXH2 mice harbor a severely hypomorphic allele at Irf8 (Irf8R294C) that causes susceptibility to infection with intracellular pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We report that BXH2 are completely resistant to the development of cerebral malaria (ECM) following Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection. Comparative transcriptional profiling of brain RNA as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to identify IRF8-regulated genes whose expression is associated with pathological acute neuroinflammation. Genes increased by infection were strongly enriched for IRF8 binding sites, suggesting that IRF8 acts as a transcriptional activator in inflammatory programs. These lists were enriched for myeloid-specific pathways, including interferon responses, antigen presentation and Th1 polarizing cytokines. We show that inactivation of several of these downstream target genes (including the Irf8 transcription partner Irf1) confers protection against ECM. ECM-resistance in Irf8 and Irf1 mutants is associated with impaired myeloid and lymphoid cells function, including production of IL12p40 and IFNγ. We note strong overlap between genes bound and regulated by IRF8 during ECM and genes regulated in the lungs of M. tuberculosis infected mice. This IRF8-dependent network contains several genes recently identified as risk factors in acute and chronic human inflammatory conditions. We report a common core of IRF8-bound genes forming a critical inflammatory host-response network.
","Cerebral malaria is a severe and often lethal complication from infection with Plasmodium falciparum which is driven in part by pathological host inflammatory response to parasitized red cells′ adherence in the brain microvasculature. However, the pathways that initiate and amplify this pathological neuroinflammation are not well understood. As susceptibility to cerebral malaria is variable and has been shown to be partially heritable, we have studied this from a genetic perspective using a mouse model of infection with P. berghei which induces experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Here we show that mice bearing mutations in the myeloid transcription factor IRF8 and its heterodimerization partner IRF1 are completely resistant to ECM. We have identified the genes and associated networks that are activated by IRF8 during ECM. Loss-of-function mutations of several IRF8 targets are also shown to be protective. Parallel analysis of lungs infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis show that IRF8-associated core pathways are also engaged during tuberculosis where they play a protective role. This contrast illustrates the balancing act required by the immune system to respond to pathogens and highlights a lynchpin role for IRF8 in both. Finally, several genes in these networks have been individually associated with chronic or acute inflammatory conditions in humans.

"Variation in the clinical manifestation of dementia has been associated with differences in cognitive reserve, although less is known about the cumulative effects of exposure to cognitive reserve factors over the life course. We examined the association of cognitive reserve-related factors over the lifespan with the risk of dementia in a community-based cohort of older adults.
Information on early-life education, socioeconomic status, work complexity at age 20, midlife occupation attainment, and late-life leisure activities was collected in a cohort of dementia-free community dwellers aged 75+ y residing in the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm, Sweden, in 1987–1989. The cohort was followed up to 9 y (until 1996) to detect incident dementia cases. To exclude preclinical phases of disease, participants who developed dementia at the first follow-up examination 3 y after the baseline were excluded (n = 602 after exclusions). Structural equation modelling was used to generate latent factors of cognitive reserve from three periods over the life course: early (before 20 y), adulthood (around 30–55 y), and late life (75 y and older). The correlation between early- and adult-life latent factors was strong (γ = 0.9), whereas early–late (γ = 0.27) and adult–late (γ = 0.16) latent factor correlations were weak. One hundred forty-eight participants developed dementia during follow-up, and 454 remained dementia-free. The relative risk (RR) of dementia was estimated using Cox models with life-course cognitive reserve-enhancing factors modelled separately and simultaneously to assess direct and indirect effects. The analysis was repeated among carriers and noncarriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A reduced risk of dementia was associated with early- (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.36–0.90), adult- (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.42–0.87), and late-life (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.37–0.73) reserve-enhancing latent factors in separate multivariable Cox models. In a mutually adjusted model, which may have been imprecisely estimated because of strong correlation between early- and adult-life factors, the late-life factor preserved its association (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45–0.94), whereas the effect of midlife (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.50–1.06) and early-life factors (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.47–1.23) on the risk of dementia was attenuated. The risk declined progressively with cumulative exposure to reserve-enhancing latent factors, and having high scores on cognitive reserve-enhancing composite factors in all three periods over the life course was associated with the lowest risk of dementia (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.20–0.81). Similar associations were detected among APOE ε4 allele carriers and noncarriers. Limitations include measurement error and nonresponse, with both biases likely favouring the null. Strong correlation between early- and adult-life latent factors may have led to a loss in precision when estimating mutually adjusted effects of all periods.
In this study, cumulative exposure to reserve-enhancing factors over the lifespan was associated with reduced risk of dementia in late life, even among individuals with genetic predisposition.
","It has emerged from previous literature that lifestyle factors such as physical exercise, intellectual stimulation, or leisure activities are associated with a reduced risk of dementia occurrence in late life. One possibility is that these activities provide protection in the form of reserve, facilitating the maintenance of cognitive function in the face of cumulative brain damage.
It is, however, still largely unknown how the risk of dementia is shaped by various reserve-stimulating lifestyle factors simultaneously taking place throughout the entire life course.
Our study was designed to examine the association between the risk of dementia occurrence after age 75 and engagement in a variety of reserve-enhancing activities over the entire life course.
We estimated the risk of dementia occurrence in a cohort of individuals aged 75 y and older conditional on their engagement in ten activities that were expected to promote reserve in three stages over the life course.
We found that, on its own, engagement in early-, adulthood-, and late-life reserve-enhancing activities was associated with a reduced risk of dementia. However, when all three factors were simultaneously evaluated for their association with dementia, the effects of early-life and adulthood factors were attenuated. This could be due to the strong correlation between early-life and adulthood factors, whereas the late-life factor was only moderately related to either early-life or adulthood markers of reserve.
An important finding was that increased frequency of engagement in stimulating activities over the life course was associated with a progressively reduced risk of dementia, suggesting a dose-response effect between life-course reserve and dementia risk. This effect appeared to operate irrespective of genetic predisposition to dementia.
These findings strongly suggest that development of dementia is a lifelong process that begins decades before the onset of the disease.
At the same time, it is never too late to initiate interventions aimed at risk modifying, since late-life engagement in stimulating activities was associated with a lower risk of dementia.
However, because reserve-enhancing activities are correlated over the life course, and because the lowest risk is enjoyed by individuals with increased frequency of stimulating engagements, the most effective strategies are likely to be those emphasizing risk reduction throughout the entire life course.

"Dysregulation of AMPK signaling has been implicated in many human diseases, which emphasizes the importance of characterizing AMPK regulators. The tumor suppressor FLCN, responsible for the Birt-Hogg Dubé renal neoplasia syndrome (BHD), is an AMPK-binding partner but the genetic and functional links between FLCN and AMPK have not been established. Strikingly, the majority of naturally occurring FLCN mutations predisposing to BHD are predicted to produce truncated proteins unable to bind AMPK, pointing to the critical role of this interaction in the tumor suppression mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that FLCN is an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of AMPK. Using Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells, we show that loss of FLCN results in constitutive activation of AMPK which induces autophagy, inhibits apoptosis, improves cellular bioenergetics, and confers resistance to energy-depleting stresses including oxidative stress, heat, anoxia, and serum deprivation. We further show that AMPK activation conferred by FLCN loss is independent of the cellular energy state suggesting that FLCN controls the AMPK energy sensing ability. Together, our data suggest that FLCN is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of AMPK signaling that may act as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AMPK function.
","The FLCN gene is responsible for the hereditary human tumor disease called Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD). Patients that inherit an inactivating mutation in the FLCN gene develop lung collapse as well as tumors in the kidney, colon, and skin. It is not clear yet what the exact function of this protein is in the cell or an organism. In this study, we used a simple model organism (the round worm C. elegans) to study the function of FLCN. We found that it is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism in the cell. FLCN normally binds and blocks the action of another protein (AMPK), which is involved in the maintenance of energy levels. When energy levels fall, AMPK is activated and drives a recycling pathway called autophagy, where cellular components are recycled producing energy. In the absence of FLCN in worms and mammalian cells, like in tumors of BHD patients, AMPK and autophagy are chronically activated leading to an increased energy level, which makes the cells/organism very resistant to many stresses that would normally kill them, which in the end could lead to progression of tumorigenesis.

"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) disease depends on the transfer of effector proteins into epithelia lining the human small intestine. EPEC E2348/69 has at least 20 effector genes of which six are located with the effector-delivery system genes on the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) Pathogenicity Island. Our previous work implied that non-LEE-encoded (Nle) effectors possess functions that inhibit epithelial anti-microbial and inflammation-inducing responses by blocking NF-κB transcription factor activity. Indeed, screens by us and others have identified novel inhibitory mechanisms for NleC and NleH, with key co-operative functions for NleB1 and NleE1. Here, we demonstrate that the LEE-encoded Translocated-intimin receptor (Tir) effector has a potent and specific ability to inhibit NF-κB activation. Indeed, biochemical, imaging and immunoprecipitation studies reveal a novel inhibitory mechanism whereby Tir interaction with cytoplasm-located TNFα receptor-associated factor (TRAF) adaptor proteins induces their proteasomal-independent degradation. Infection studies support this Tir-TRAF relationship but reveal that Tir, like NleC and NleH, has a non-essential contribution in EPEC's NF-κB inhibitory capacity linked to Tir's activity being suppressed by undefined EPEC factors. Infections in a disease-relevant intestinal model confirm key NF-κB inhibitory roles for the NleB1/NleE1 effectors, with other studies providing insights on host targets. The work not only reveals a second Intimin-independent property for Tir and a novel EPEC effector-mediated NF-κB inhibitory mechanism but also lends itself to speculations on the evolution of EPEC's capacity to inhibit NF-κB function.
","Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) remain an important cause of infant diarrhoea and death in developing countries. Undoubtedly, a key pathogenic event relates to the bacteria's ability to inhibit the expression of anti-microbial and inflammation-inducing molecules regulated by the NF-κB transcription factor. This inhibitory process was previously linked to undefined EPEC effectors blocking NF-κB function. In this manuscript, we report that the most extensively studied EPEC effector, Tir, possesses a potent and specific ability to inhibit the cytokine, TNFα from activating NF-κB. Moreover, this finding leads to the discovery of a novel inhibitory mechanism relating to the induced degradation of the TNFα Receptor-Associated Factor (TRAF) adaptor protein. Additional work supports reported NF-κB inhibitory activities for multiple non-LEE-encoded effectors and key roles for two (identifying possible target proteins) leading to speculations on the evolution of EPEC's multi-effector strategy for inhibiting NF-κB activity.

"Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) populated Siberia, Beringia, and North America during the Pleistocene and early Holocene. Recent breakthroughs in ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two specimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is from a mainland population 45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful. The second, a 4300 yr old specimen, is derived from an isolated population on Wrangel island where mammoths subsisted with small effective population size more than 43-fold lower than previous populations. These extreme differences in effective population size offer a rare opportunity to test nearly neutral models of genome architecture evolution within a single species. Using these previously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and non-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify a greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene sequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of premature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent with genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the dwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island. In addition, we observe high rates of loss of olfactory receptors and urinary proteins, either because these loci are non-essential or because they were favored by divergent selective pressures in island environments. Finally, at the locus of FOXQ1 we observe two independent loss-of-function mutations, which would confer a satin coat phenotype in this island woolly mammoth.
","We observe an excess of detrimental mutations, consistent with genomic meltdown in woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island just prior to extinction. We observe an excess of deletions, an increase in the proportion of deletions affecting gene sequences, and an excess of premature stop codons in response to evolution under low effective population sizes. Large numbers of olfactory receptors appear to have loss of function mutations in the island mammoth. These results offer genetic support within a single species for nearly-neutral theories of genome evolution. We also observe two independent loss of function mutations at the FOXQ1 locus, likely conferring a satin coat in this unusual woolly mammoth.

"Many viruses subvert the host cell's ability to mount and complete various DNA damage responses (DDRs) after infection. HCMV infection of permissive fibroblasts activates host DDRs at the time of viral deposition and during replication, but the DDRs remain uncompleted without arrest or apoptosis. We believe this was in part due to partitioning of the damage response and double strand break repair components. After extraction of soluble proteins, the localization of these components fell into three groups: specifically associated with the viral replication centers (RCs), diffused throughout the nucleoplasm and excluded from the RCs. Others have shown that cells are incapable of processing exogenously introduced damage after infection. We hypothesized that the inability of the cells to process damage might be due to the differential association of repair components within the RCs and, in turn, potentially preferential repair of the viral genome and compromised repair of the host genome. To test this hypothesis we used multiple strategies to examine repair of UV-induced DNA damage in mock and virus-infected fibroblasts. Comet assays indicated that repair was initiated, but was not completed in infected cells. Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent localization of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) revealed that after 24 h of repair, CPDs were significantly reduced in viral DNA, but not significantly changed in the infected host DNA. To further quantitate CPD repair, we developed a novel dual-color Southern protocol allowing visualization of host and viral DNA simultaneously. Combining this Southern methodology with a CPD-specific T4 endonuclease V alkaline agarose assay to quantitate repair of adducts, we found efficient repair of CPDs from the viral DNA but not host cellular DNA. Our data confirm that NER functions in HCMV-infected cells and almost exclusively repairs the viral genome to the detriment of the host's genome.
","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a leading cause of birth defects. This may be due in part to this virus' ability to inflict specific damage to its host's DNA, combined with the disruption of an infected cell's ability to repair damage. Earlier studies found that components of the cell's repair machinery were differentially associated with the HCMV viral replication centers in the nucleus. Experiments here extend this observation to include components of the machinery involved in UV lesion repair. We hypothesized that association of components of the DNA repair machinery within the viral replication centers could favor the repair of viral DNA, but more importantly, be detrimental to the repair of cellular DNA. Infected cells were irradiated and examined for repair by three different methods. In the course of this study, we developed a new technique allowing simultaneous evaluation of both the viral and host genomes in an infected cell. These experiments found rapid, selective removal of UV lesions from the viral and not the cellular DNA within infected cells. Our results indicate the differential association of certain cellular repair proteins with this virus may have far-reaching implications in the disease pathogenesis of HCMV infection.

"The forkhead transcription factor Foxn1 is indispensable for thymus development, but the mechanisms by which it mediates thymic epithelial cell (TEC) development are poorly understood. To examine the cellular and molecular basis of Foxn1 function, we generated a novel and revertible hypomorphic allele of Foxn1. By varying levels of its expression, we identified a number of features of the Foxn1 system. Here we show that Foxn1 is a powerful regulator of TEC differentiation that is required at multiple intermediate stages of TE lineage development in the fetal and adult thymus. We find no evidence for a role for Foxn1 in TEC fate-choice. Rather, we show it is required for stable entry into both the cortical and medullary TEC differentiation programmes and subsequently is needed at increasing dosage for progression through successive differentiation states in both cortical and medullary TEC. We further demonstrate regulation by Foxn1 of a suite of genes with diverse roles in thymus development and/or function, suggesting it acts as a master regulator of the core thymic epithelial programme rather than regulating a particular aspect of TEC biology. Overall, our data establish a genetics-based model of cellular hierarchies in the TE lineage and provide mechanistic insight relating titration of a single transcription factor to control of lineage progression. Our novel revertible hypomorph system may be similarly applied to analyzing other regulators of development.
","The thymus is the specialized organ responsible for generating T cells, which are required to regulate and effect immune responses. The unique functions of the thymus are mediated by a diverse array of specialized epithelial cells found only within this organ. These specialized, functionally mature thymic epithelial cells are generated from immature epithelial progenitor cells present in the fetal and adult thymus through a highly regulated process, termed differentiation, that is tightly controlled by specific genes. Foxn1, a protein that is expressed in thymic epithelial cells, is a transcription factor—a protein that regulates how other genes are expressed. Here, we have investigated the role of Foxn1 in generating mature thymic epithelial cells from immature progenitors. We find that Foxn1 is required throughout this process, from the onset of differentiation in progenitor thymic epithelial cells in the developing fetus to the final differentiation steps through which thymic epithelial cells mature to acquire their full functionality. We further find that Foxn1 controls the expression of a variety of genes with different functions in thymic epithelial cells. Overall, our study defines the role of Foxn1 in thymus development at the cellular level and provides insight into how it mediates these functions.

"Since 2011, cohorts of schoolchildren in regions bordering Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania have been investigated for morbidity caused by Schistosoma mansoni infection. Despite being neighbouring countries with similar lifestyles and ecological environments, Tanzanian schoolchildren had lower S. mansoni prevalence and intensity and they were taller and heavier, fewer were wasted and anaemic, and more were physical fit compared to their Kenyan peers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether diet and school-related markers of socioeconomic status (SES) could explain differences in morbidity beyond the effect of infection levels.
Parasitological and morbidity data from surveys in 2013–2014 were compared with information on diet and school-related markers of SES collected in 2015 using questionnaires. A total of 490 schoolchildren (163 Kenyans and 327 Tanzanians) aged 9–11 years provided data. A higher proportion of Tanzanian pupils (69.4%, 95% CI: 64.3–74.5) knew where to wash hands after toilet visits compared to Kenyan pupils (48.5%, 95% CI: 40.9–56.1; P<0.0005). Similar proportions of children in the two countries ate breakfast, lunch and dinner, but the content of the meals differed. At all three meals, a higher proportion (95% CI) of Tanzanian pupils consumed animal proteins (mostly fish proteins) compared to their Kenyan peers (35.0% (28.3–41.7) vs. 0%; P<0.0005 at breakfast; 69.0% (63.9–74.1) vs. 43.6% (35.8–51.4); P<0.0005 at lunch; and 67.2% (62.1–72.3) vs. 53.4% (45.8–61.0); P = 0.003 at dinner). Multivariable analyses investigating risk factors for important morbidity markers among individuals revealed that after controlling for schistosome and malaria infections, eating animal proteins (fish) and knowing where to wash hands after toilet visits were significant predictors for both haemoglobin levels and physical fitness (measured as VO2 max).
These results suggest that the differences in morbidity may be affected by factors other than S. mansoni infection alone. Diet and hygiene practice differences were associated with health status of schoolchildren along Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania.
Trials Registration numbers: ISRCT 16755535 (Kenya), ISRCT 95819193 (Tanzania).
","Millions of school-age children in Kenya and Tanzania are at risk for infection with Schistosoma mansoni, which has an impact on their physical health.

The pupils in Tanzania had lower prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection compared to pupils in Kenya, but more had malaria parasites in their blood. In addition, Tanzanian pupils were taller and heavier, fewer were anaemic and they scored higher in a physical fitness test.

Diet and hygiene practices seem to contribute to the health status of schoolchildren along Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania.

"Caspase-dependent cleavage of antigens associated with apoptotic cells plays a prominent role in the generation of CD8+ T cell responses in various infectious diseases. We found that the emergence of a large population of autoreactive CD8+ T effector cells specific for apoptotic T cell-associated self-epitopes exceeds the antiviral responses in patients with acute hepatitis C virus infection. Importantly, they endow mixed polyfunctional type-1, type-2 and type-17 responses and correlate with the chronic progression of infection. This evolution is related to the selection of autoreactive CD8+ T cells with higher T cell receptor avidity, whereas those with lower avidity undergo prompt contraction in patients who clear infection. These findings demonstrate a previously undescribed strict link between the emergence of high frequencies of mixed autoreactive CD8+ T cells producing a broad array of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-4, IL-2…) and the progression toward chronic disease in a human model of acute infection.
","The emergence of a large population of mixed polyfunctional (type-1, -2, -17) CD8+ T cell effector responses specific for apoptotic T cell-associated self-epitopes rather than the dysfunction or altered quality of virus-specific CD8+ T cells is associated with the progression toward chronic disease in the human model of acute HCV infection. The chronic evolution is associated with the selection of autoreactive CD8+ T cells with higher T cell receptor avidity, whereas those with lower avidity undergo prompt contraction, as seen in patients undergoing infection resolution. We suggest that these autoreactive responses are secondary to the viral persistence and can participate to the HCV-related immunopathology. This data has implications for the prognosis and therapy of infections undergoing chronic evolution.

"It is increasingly clear that transcription factors play versatile roles in turning genes “on” or “off” depending on cellular context via the various transcription complexes they form. This poses a major challenge in unraveling combinatorial transcription complex codes. Here we use the powerful genetics of Drosophila combined with microarray and bioinformatics analyses to tackle this challenge. The nuclear adaptor CHIP/LDB is a major developmental regulator capable of forming tissue-specific transcription complexes with various types of transcription factors and cofactors, making it a valuable model to study the intricacies of gene regulation. To date only few CHIP/LDB complexes target genes have been identified, and possible tissue-dependent crosstalk between these complexes has not been rigorously explored. SSDP proteins protect CHIP/LDB complexes from proteasome dependent degradation and are rate-limiting cofactors for these complexes. By using mutations in SSDP, we identified 189 down-stream targets of CHIP/LDB and show that these genes are enriched for the binding sites of APTEROUS (AP) and PANNIER (PNR), two well studied transcription factors associated with CHIP/LDB complexes. We performed extensive genetic screens and identified target genes that genetically interact with components of CHIP/LDB complexes in directing the development of the wings (28 genes) and thoracic bristles (23 genes). Moreover, by in vivo RNAi silencing we uncovered novel roles for two of the target genes, xbp1 and Gs-alpha, in early development of these structures. Taken together, our results suggest that loss of SSDP disrupts the normal balance between the CHIP-AP and the CHIP-PNR transcription complexes, resulting in down-regulation of CHIP-AP target genes and the concomitant up-regulation of CHIP-PNR target genes. Understanding the combinatorial nature of transcription complexes as presented here is crucial to the study of transcription regulation of gene batteries required for development.
","Different cell types in multi-cellular organisms are determined by the repertoire of genes active in each cell. This repertoire, or transcriptome, is established by the coordinated activity of transcription factors and cofactors that form modular transcription complexes. The modular nature of transcription complexes complicates our understanding of how transcription factors shape the transcriptome. CHIP/LDB transcription complexes direct formation of various cell types including blood and nerve cells. CHIP/LDB malfunction leads to developmental defects and cancer. The function of these complexes depends critically on the docking of specific transcription factors and co-factors at a specific time and in a specific cell type, making them outstanding models for intricate transcriptional regulation. Here we demonstrate that loss of SSDP, a key regulatory component of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes, alters transcription of a large group of genes. We used bioinformatics tools and genetic tests to examine the function of additional components of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes and their target genes during the development of specific organs. We demonstrate how differences in the availability of transcription factors in different cells can affect the function and composition of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes.

"Homologous recombination in the genetic transformation model organism Streptococcus pneumoniae is thought to be important in the adaptation and evolution of this pathogen. While competent pneumococci are able to scavenge DNA added to laboratory cultures, large-scale transfers of multiple kb are rare under these conditions. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to map transfers in recombinants arising from contact of competent cells with non-competent ‘target’ cells, using strains with known genomes, distinguished by a total of ~16,000 SNPs. Experiments designed to explore the effect of environment on large scale recombination events used saturating purified donor DNA, short-term cell assemblages on Millipore filters, and mature biofilm mixed cultures. WGS of 22 recombinants for each environment mapped all SNPs that were identical between the recombinant and the donor but not the recipient. The mean recombination event size was found to be significantly larger in cell-to-cell contact cultures (4051 bp in filter assemblage and 3938 bp in biofilm co-culture versus 1815 bp with saturating DNA). Up to 5.8% of the genome was transferred, through 20 recombination events, to a single recipient, with the largest single event incorporating 29,971 bp. We also found that some recombination events are clustered, that these clusters are more likely to occur in cell-to-cell contact environments, and that they cause significantly increased linkage of genes as far apart as 60,000 bp. We conclude that pneumococcal evolution through homologous recombination is more likely to occur on a larger scale in environments that permit cell-to-cell contact.
","Bacteria shuffle their genes far less often than humans do and genes or traits are more directly linked with the singular bacterial parent cell rather than the two parents that are involved in sexual reproduction. However, bacteria do occasionally have sex in the form of homologous recombination by taking up external DNA and incorporating it into their genomes. This happens far less regularly than sexual reproduction happens in human generations but is a known way that bacteria undergo ‘Horizontal gene transfer’. This means that genes can be acquired without being inherited. In this study we show that this form of horizontal gene transfer is more likely to happen in certain environments over others in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In particular, we show that this is more likely to happen in environments that closely mirror the nasopharynx which is the natural habitat of S. pneumoniae.

"Microbial pathogens impose selective pressures on their hosts, and combatting these pathogens is fundamental to the propagation of a species. Innate immunity is an ancient system that provides the foundation for pathogen resistance, with epithelial cells in humans increasingly appreciated to play key roles in innate defense. Here, we show that the nematode C. elegans displays genetic variation in epithelial immunity against intestinal infection by its natural pathogen, Nematocida parisii. This pathogen belongs to the microsporidia phylum, which comprises a large phylum of over 1400 species of fungal-related parasites that can infect all animals, including humans, but are poorly understood. Strikingly, we find that a wild C. elegans strain from Hawaii is able to clear intracellular infection by N. parisii, with this ability restricted to young larval animals. Notably, infection of older larvae does not impair progeny production, while infection of younger larvae does. The early-life immunity of Hawaiian larvae enables them to produce more progeny later in life, providing a selective advantage in a laboratory setting—in the presence of parasite it is able to out-compete a susceptible strain in just a few generations. We show that enhanced immunity is dominant to susceptibility, and we use quantitative trait locus mapping to identify four genomic loci associated with resistance. Furthermore, we generate near-isogenic strains to directly demonstrate that two of these loci influence resistance. Thus, our findings show that early-life immunity of C. elegans against microsporidia is a complex trait that enables the host to produce more progeny later in life, likely improving its evolutionary success.
","Infectious diseases caused by microbes create some of the strongest forces in evolution, by killing their hosts, and impairing their ability to produce progeny. Microsporidia are very common microbes that cause disease in all animals, including roundworms, insects, fish and people. We investigated microsporidia infection in the roundworm C. elegans, and found that strains from diverse parts of the world have differing levels of resistance against infection. Interestingly, a C. elegans strain from Hawaii can clear infection but only during the earliest stage of life. This resistance appears to be evolutionarily important, because it is during this early stage of life when infection can greatly reduce the number of progeny produced by the host. Consistent with this idea, if the Hawaiian strain is infected when young, it will ultimately produce more progeny than a susceptible strain of C. elegans. We find that this early life resistance of Hawaiian animals is due to a combination of genetic regions, which together provide enhanced immunity against a natural pathogen, thus enabling this strain to have more offspring.

"The use of conventional chemical insecticides and bacterial toxins to control lepidopteran pests of global agriculture has imposed significant selection pressure leading to the rapid evolution of insecticide resistance. Transgenic crops (e.g., cotton) expressing the Bt Cry toxins are now used world wide to control these pests, including the highly polyphagous and invasive cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. Since 2004, the Cry2Ab toxin has become widely used for controlling H. armigera, often used in combination with Cry1Ac to delay resistance evolution. Isolation of H. armigera and H. punctigera individuals heterozygous for Cry2Ab resistance in 2002 and 2004, respectively, allowed aspects of Cry2Ab resistance (level, fitness costs, genetic dominance, complementation tests) to be characterised in both species. However, the gene identity and genetic changes conferring this resistance were unknown, as was the detailed Cry2Ab mode of action. No cross-resistance to Cry1Ac was observed in mutant lines. Biphasic linkage analysis of a Cry2Ab-resistant H. armigera family followed by exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) marker mapping and candidate gene sequencing identified three independent resistance-associated INDEL mutations in an ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter gene we named HaABCA2. A deletion mutation was also identified in the H. punctigera homolog from the resistant line. All mutations truncate the ABCA2 protein. Isolation of further Cry2Ab resistance alleles in the same gene from field H. armigera populations indicates unequal resistance allele frequencies and the potential for Bt resistance evolution. Identification of the gene involved in resistance as an ABC transporter of the A subfamily adds to the body of evidence on the crucial role this gene family plays in the mode of action of the Bt Cry toxins. The structural differences between the ABCA2, and that of the C subfamily required for Cry1Ac toxicity, indicate differences in the detailed mode-of-action of the two Bt Cry toxins.
","Transgenic crops expressing the insecticidal protein Cry2Ab from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are used worldwide to suppress damage by lepidopteran pests, often used in combination with Cry1Ac toxin to delay resistance evolution. Until now, the Cry2Ab mode of action and the mechanism of resistance were unknown, with field-isolated Cry2Ab resistant Helicoverpa armigera showing no cross-resistance to Cry1Ac. In this study, biphasic linkage analysis of a Cry2Ab-resistant H. armigera family followed by EPIC marker mapping and candidate gene sequencing identified three independent INDEL mutations in an ATP-Binding Cassette transporter subfamily A gene (ABCA2). A deletion mutation was identified in the same gene of resistant H. punctigera. All four mutations are predicted to truncate the ABCA2 protein. This is the first molecular genetic characterization of insect resistance to the Cry2Ab toxin, and detection of diverse Cry2Ab resistance alleles will contribute to understanding the micro-evolutionary processes that underpinned lepidopteran Bt-resistance.

"We recently found that Yersinia pseudotuberculosis can be used as a model of persistent bacterial infections. We performed in vivo RNA-seq of bacteria in small cecal tissue biopsies at early and persistent stages of infection to determine strategies associated with persistence. Comprehensive analysis of mixed RNA populations from infected tissues revealed that Y. pseudotuberculosis undergoes transcriptional reprogramming with drastic down-regulation of T3SS virulence genes during persistence when the pathogen resides within the cecum. At the persistent stage, the expression pattern in many respects resembles the pattern seen in vitro at 26oC, with for example, up-regulation of flagellar genes and invA. These findings are expected to have impact on future rationales to identify suitable bacterial targets for new antibiotics. Other genes that are up-regulated during persistence are genes involved in anaerobiosis, chemotaxis, and protection against oxidative and acidic stress, which indicates the influence of different environmental cues. We found that the Crp/CsrA/RovA regulatory cascades influence the pattern of bacterial gene expression during persistence. Furthermore, arcA, fnr, frdA, and wrbA play critical roles in persistence. Our findings suggest a model for the life cycle of this enteropathogen with reprogramming from a virulent to an adapted phenotype capable of persisting and spreading by fecal shedding.
","To establish infection and colonize within a host, infecting pathogens have to cope with a variety of destructive surroundings. The food-borne pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis can cause persistent infection in mice. Upon infection, Y. pseudotuberculosis passes the anti-microbial gastrointestinal milieu and finally remains associated with lymphoid follicles in cecal tissue surrounded by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, indicating that the bacteria are exposed to multiple environmental cues. We performed complex RNA-seq of small cecal biopsies of infected mice to reveal Y. pseudotuberculosis gene expression in vivo. We found that Y. pseudotuberculosis underwent reprogramming from a virulent phenotype, expressing virulence genes during early infection, to an adapted phenotype capable of persisting in the harsh cecal environment. Persistence was characterized by a novel expression pattern with down-regulation of virulence genes and up-regulation of genes involved in anaerobiosis, chemotaxis, and protection against oxidative and acidic stress. Mutagenesis of selected genes revealed that the regulator rovA was critical for the establishment of infection, and that arcA, fnr, frdA, and wrbA play critical roles in maintaining infection for long periods of time. Our study shows the power of RNA deep sequencing, which can be used to reveal the in vivo expression patterns of small amounts of bacteria in complex intestinal environments.

"Cholera remains an important public health problem. Yet there are few reliable population-based estimates of laboratory-confirmed cholera incidence in endemic areas around the world.
We established treatment facility–based cholera surveillance in three sites in Jakarta (Indonesia), Kolkata (India), and Beira (Mozambique). The annual incidence of cholera was estimated using the population census as the denominator and the age-specific number of cholera cases among the study cohort as the numerator.
The lowest overall rate was found in Jakarta, where the estimated incidence was 0.5/1000 population/year. The incidence was three times higher in Kolkata (1.6/1000/year) and eight times higher in Beira (4.0/1000/year). In all study sites, the greatest burden was in children under 5 years of age.
There are considerable differences in cholera incidence across these endemic areas but in all sites, children are the most affected. The study site in Africa had the highest cholera incidence consistent with a growing impression of the large cholera burden in Africa. Burden estimates are useful when considering where and among whom interventions such as vaccination would be most needed.
","Cholera is an often forgotten disease affecting the world's forgotten people. When a large cholera outbreak occurs, the disease appears briefly on the radar of public attention. Some unfortunate populations around the world suffer recurrent episodes of cholera but their plight goes unnoticed. We established cholera surveillance in impoverished areas in Jakarta (Indonesia), Kolkata (India), and Beira (Mozambique) where the disease is known to occur regularly. The cholera burden was calculated using the site population as the denominator and the number of cholera cases as the numerator. The lowest overall rate was in Jakarta with 0.5 cases per 1000 population per year. The incidence was three times higher in Kolkata (1.6/1000/year) and eight times higher in Beira (4.0/1000/year), adding to the growing impression of the large cholera problem in Africa. In all sites, children are the most affected. Estimates such as these are useful when considering where and among whom interventions against the disease are most needed. Improvement of water supply and sanitation is the best strategy against cholera and other diarrheal diseases but may not be achievable in these impoverished areas in the near future. Other immediate, short- to medium-term strategies such as vaccination against cholera may be useful.

"Recent epidemics of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya have heightened the need to understand the seasonal and geographic range of transmission by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. We use mechanistic transmission models to derive predictions for how the probability and magnitude of transmission for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue change with mean temperature, and we show that these predictions are well matched by human case data. Across all three viruses, models and human case data both show that transmission occurs between 18–34°C with maximal transmission occurring in a range from 26–29°C. Controlling for population size and two socioeconomic factors, temperature-dependent transmission based on our mechanistic model is an important predictor of human transmission occurrence and incidence. Risk maps indicate that tropical and subtropical regions are suitable for extended seasonal or year-round transmission, but transmission in temperate areas is limited to at most three months per year even if vectors are present. Such brief transmission windows limit the likelihood of major epidemics following disease introduction in temperate zones.
","Understanding the drivers of recent Zika, dengue, and chikungunya epidemics is a major public health priority. Temperature may play an important role because it affects virus transmission by mosquitoes, through its effects on mosquito development, survival, reproduction, and biting rates as well as the rate at which mosquitoes acquire and transmit viruses. Here, we measure the impact of temperature on transmission by two of the most common mosquito vector species for these viruses, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We integrate data from several laboratory experiments into a mathematical model of temperature-dependent transmission, and find that transmission peaks at 26–29°C and can occur between 18–34°C. Statistically comparing model predictions with recent observed human cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika across the Americas suggests an important role for temperature, and supports model predictions. Using the model, we predict that most of the tropics and subtropics are suitable for transmission in many or all months of the year, but that temperate areas like most of the United States are only suitable for transmission for a few months during the summer (even if the mosquito vector is present).

"DExD/H box RNA helicases, such as the RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), are important components of the innate immune system. Here we demonstrate a pivotal and sex-specific role for the heterosomal isoforms of the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX3 in the immune system. Mice lacking DDX3X during hematopoiesis showed an altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen and a striking inability to combat infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Alterations in innate immune responses resulted from decreased effector cell availability and function as well as a sex-dependent impairment of cytokine synthesis. Thus, our data provide further in vivo evidence for an essential contribution of a non-RLR DExD/H RNA helicase to innate immunity and suggest it may contribute to sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammatory disease.
","The establishment of innate immunity to pathogens requires cells to sense microbial molecules and to initiate a de novo transcription-based antimicrobial response. With the identification of Rig I and Mda5, two RNA helicases were shown to serve as pivotal receptors of viral RNA. Subsequently, a considerable number of RNA helicases were proposed to function as sensors or signal transducers for both microbial RNA and DNA. X-chromosome-encoded RNA helicase DDX3X was discovered as an interactor of the S/T kinase TBK1 which regulates the production of type I Interferons (IFN-I). However, the importance of DDX3X for innate immunity in an organismic context remained elusive. Here we describe and analyze mice lacking DDX3X in hematopoietic cells. We show contributions of DDX3X to hematopoiesis and a striking loss in resistance against Listeria monocytogenes. Our data reveal that DDX3X is critically involved in enhancing the expression of numerous antimicrobial genes. Consistently, production of important cytokines such as IL12 or IFNγ is reduced. Furthermore, DDX3X-deficient macrophages show reduced ability to restrict L. monocytogenes growth. Owing to partial redundancy with its close Y-chromosomal homologue, DDX3Y, the observed effects differ between mouse sexes. Thus, DDX3X may contribute to sex differences in immunity to pathogens and inflammatory disease.

"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human alphaherpesvirus that causes varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Like all herpesviruses, the VZV DNA genome is replicated in the nucleus and packaged into nucleocapsids that must egress across the nuclear membrane for incorporation into virus particles in the cytoplasm. Our recent work showed that VZV nucleocapsids are sequestered in nuclear cages formed from promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in vitro and in human dorsal root ganglia and skin xenografts in vivo. We sought a method to determine the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of nucleocapsids in the nuclei of herpesvirus-infected cells as well as the 3D shape, volume and ultrastructure of these unique PML subnuclear domains. Here we report the development of a novel 3D imaging and reconstruction strategy that we term Serial Section Array-Scanning Electron Microscopy (SSA-SEM) and its application to the analysis of VZV-infected cells and these nuclear PML cages. We show that SSA-SEM permits large volume imaging and 3D reconstruction at a resolution sufficient to localize, count and distinguish different types of VZV nucleocapsids and to visualize complete PML cages. This method allowed a quantitative determination of how many nucleocapsids can be sequestered within individual PML cages (sequestration capacity), what proportion of nucleocapsids are entrapped in single nuclei (sequestration efficiency) and revealed the ultrastructural detail of the PML cages. More than 98% of all nucleocapsids in reconstructed nuclear volumes were contained in PML cages and single PML cages sequestered up to 2,780 nucleocapsids, which were shown by electron tomography to be embedded and cross-linked by an filamentous electron-dense meshwork within these unique subnuclear domains. This SSA-SEM analysis extends our recent characterization of PML cages and provides a proof of concept for this new strategy to investigate events during virion assembly at the single cell level.
","Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the cause of varicella and zoster, is a human herpesvirus that replicates in the host cell nucleus where viral genomes are packaged into virion nucleocapsids. We have recently identified antiviral PML (promyelocytic leukemia) nuclear cages that sequester VZV nucleocapsids and inhibit formation of infectious particles. Here we developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) imaging and reconstruction strategy, termed Serial Section Array-Scanning Electron Microscopy (SSA-SEM) that together with electron tomography made it possible to derive 3D reconstructions of complete herpesvirus infected host cell nuclei and of PML cages with ultrastructural precision for the first time. We determined the 3D distribution of several thousand nucleocapsids within reconstructed volumes of single host cell nuclei and in PML cages as well as their sequestration efficiency and sequestration capacity: more than 98% of nucleocapsids were entrapped within PML cages and individual PML cages could sequester nearly 3,000 nucleocapsids which were cross-linked by an irregular electron-dense meshwork within the PML cages. This 3D analysis provides a proof of concept for using SSA-SEM to investigate virion assembly at the whole cell level and further elucidates our observation that PML cages are antiviral nuclear domains which block VZV nucleocapsid egress from the infected cell nucleus.

"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a leading cause of disability in South Pacific regions, where >96% of the 1.7 million population are at risk of LF infection. As part of current global campaign, mass drug administration (MDA) has effectively reduced lymphatic filiariasis prevalence, but mosquito vector biology can complicate the MDA strategy. In some regions, there is evidence that the goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone. Obligate vector mosquitoes provide additional targets for breaking the LF transmission cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector throughout much of the South Pacific, Aedes polynesiensis.
Here we demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in an A. polynesiensis strain (‘CP’ strain) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate that CP males are equally competitive, resulting in population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A. polynesiensis populations.
The findings demonstrate strategy feasibility and encourage field tests of the vector elimination strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts.
","Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a global health problem, with over 120 million people affected annually. The current LF elimination program is focused on administering anti-filarial drugs to the entire at-risk population via annual mass drug administration (MDA). While the MDA program is proving effective in many areas, other areas may require augmentative measures such as vector control. An example of the latter is provided by some regions of the South Pacific where Aedes polynesiensis is the primary vector. Here, we describe a novel vector control approach based upon naturally occurring Wolbachia bacterial infections. Wolbachia are endosymbiotic intracellular bacteria that cause a form of sterility known as cytoplasmic incompatibility. We show that introgression crosses with mosquitoes that are infected with a different Wolbachia type results in an A. polynesiensis strain (designated ‘CP’) that is incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes. No difference in mating competitiveness is observed between CP males and wild type males in laboratory assays. The results support continued development of the strategy as a tool to improve public health.

"Cells of different organs at different ages have an intrinsic set of kinetics that dictates their behavior. Transformation into cancer cells will inherit these kinetics that determine initial cell and tumor population progression dynamics. Subject to genetic mutation and epigenetic alterations, cancer cell kinetics can change, and favorable alterations that increase cellular fitness will manifest themselves and accelerate tumor progression. We set out to investigate the emerging intratumoral heterogeneity and to determine the evolutionary trajectories of the combination of cell-intrinsic kinetics that yield aggressive tumor growth. We develop a cellular automaton model that tracks the temporal evolution of the malignant subpopulation of so-called cancer stem cells(CSC), as these cells are exclusively able to initiate and sustain tumors. We explore orthogonal cell traits, including cell migration to facilitate invasion, spontaneous cell death due to genetic drift after accumulation of irreversible deleterious mutations, symmetric cancer stem cell division that increases the cancer stem cell pool, and telomere length and erosion as a mitotic counter for inherited non-stem cancer cell proliferation potential. Our study suggests that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. Early increase in proliferation potential yields larger populations of non-stem cancer cells(CC) that compete with CSC and thus inhibit CSC division while a reduction in proliferation potential loosens such inhibition and facilitates frequent CSC division. The sub-population of cancer stem cells in itself becomes highly heterogeneous dictating population level dynamics that vary from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression. Our study suggests that the clonal diversity that is captured in single tumor biopsy samples represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes.
","We present an in silico computational model of tumor growth and evolution according to the cancer stem cell hypothesis. Inheritable traits of cells may be genetically or epigenetically altered, and traits that confer increased fitness to the cell will be selected for on the population level. Phenotypic evolution yields aggressive tumors with large heterogeneity, prompting the notion that the cancer stem cell population per se is highly heterogeneous. Within aggressive tumors cancer stem cells with low tumorigenic potential may be isolated. Simulations of our model suggest that the cells harvested in core needle biopsies represent less than 10% of the phenotypic heterogeneity of the total tumor population. Dependent on the cells captured in the sample, xenografted tumors may exhibit aggressive growth or long-term dormancy—dynamics that may suggest opposing treatment approaches for the same tumor when translated into clinical decision-making.

"Type IV pili are long, protein filaments built from a repeating subunit that protrudes from the surface of a wide variety of infectious bacteria. They are implicated in a vast array of functions, ranging from bacterial motility to microcolony formation to infection. One of the most well-studied type IV filaments is the gonococcal type IV pilus (GC-T4P) from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea. Cryo-electron microscopy has been used to construct a model of this filament, offering insights into the structure of type IV pili. In addition, experiments have demonstrated that GC-T4P can withstand very large tension forces, and transition to a force-induced conformation. However, the details of force-generation, and the atomic-level characteristics of the force-induced conformation, are unknown. Here, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation was used to exert a force in silico on an 18 subunit segment of GC-T4P to address questions regarding the nature of the interactions that lead to the extraordinary strength of bacterial pili. SMD simulations revealed that the buried pilin α1 domains maintain hydrophobic contacts with one another within the core of the filament, leading to GC-T4P's structural stability. At the filament surface, gaps between pilin globular head domains in both the native and pulled states provide water accessible routes between the external environment and the interior of the filament, allowing water to access the pilin α1 domains as reported for VC-T4P in deuterium exchange experiments. Results were also compared to the experimentally observed force-induced conformation. In particular, an exposed amino acid sequence in the experimentally stretched filament was also found to become exposed during the SMD simulations, suggesting that initial stages of the force induced transition are well captured. Furthermore, a second sequence was shown to be initially hidden in the native filament and became exposed upon stretching.
","There are a large number of infectious bacteria that can be harmful to humans. Some bacterial infections are facilitated by long, tether-like filaments called type IV pili which extend from the surface of bacterial cells and attach to the surface of host cells. Type IV pilus filaments can grow to be many micrometers in length (bacterial cells themselves, on average, are only a couple of micrometers in length and half a micrometer in diameter), and can exert very large forces (up to 100,000 times the bodyweight of the bacteria). Because they extend from the surface of the cell, type IV pili are very good candidates for drug targeting. Computer simulation was used to exert forces on a segment of one of these filaments, in an effort to mimic the effects of tension that would be experienced by the pilus upon binding during infection. Regions of the filament that become exposed to the external environment in the pulled state were determined, in an attempt to identify amino acid sequences that could act as targets for drug design.

"Following myonecrosis, muscle satellite cells proliferate, differentiate and fuse, creating new myofibers. The Runx1 transcription factor is not expressed in naïve developing muscle or in adult muscle tissue. However, it is highly expressed in muscles exposed to myopathic damage yet, the role of Runx1 in muscle regeneration is completely unknown. Our study of Runx1 function in the muscle’s response to myonecrosis reveals that this transcription factor is activated and cooperates with the MyoD and AP-1/c-Jun transcription factors to drive the transcription program of muscle regeneration. Mice lacking dystrophin and muscle Runx1 (mdx-/Runx1f/f), exhibit impaired muscle regeneration leading to age-dependent muscle waste, gradual decrease in motor capabilities and a shortened lifespan. Runx1-deficient primary myoblasts are arrested at cell cycle G1 and consequently differentiate. Such premature differentiation disrupts the myoblasts’ normal proliferation/differentiation balance, reduces the number and size of regenerating myofibers and impairs muscle regeneration. Our combined Runx1-dependent gene expression, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and histone H3K4me1/H3K27ac modification analyses revealed a subset of Runx1-regulated genes that are co-occupied by MyoD and c-Jun in mdx-/Runx1f/f muscle. The data provide unique insights into the transcriptional program driving muscle regeneration and implicate Runx1 as an important participant in the pathology of muscle wasting diseases.
","In response to muscle injury, the muscle initiates a repair process that calls for the proliferation of muscle stem cells, which differentiate and fuse to create the myofibers that regenerate the tissue. Maintaining the balance between myoblast proliferation and differentiation is crucial for proper regeneration, with disruption leading to impaired regeneration characteristic of muscle-wasting diseases. Our study highlights the important role the Runx1 transcription factor plays in muscle regeneration and in regulating the balance between muscle stem cell proliferation and differentiation. While not expressed in healthy muscle tissue, Runx1 level significantly increases in response to various types of muscle damage. This aligns with our finding that mice lacking Runx1 in their muscles suffer from impaired muscle regeneration. Their muscles contained a significantly low number of regenerating myofibers, which were also relatively smaller in size, resulting in loss of muscle mass and motor capabilities. Our results indicate that Runx1 regulates muscle regeneration by preventing premature differentiation of proliferating myoblasts, thereby facilitating the buildup of the myoblast pool required for proper regeneration. Through genome-wide gene-expression analysis we identify a set of Runx1-regulated genes responsible for muscle regeneration thereby implicating Runx1 in the pathology of muscle wasting diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

"Salmonella enterica replicates in macrophages through the action of effector proteins translocated across the vacuolar membrane by a type III secretion system (T3SS). Here we show that the SPI-2 T3SS effector SpvD suppresses proinflammatory immune responses. SpvD prevented activation of an NF-ĸB-dependent promoter and caused nuclear accumulation of importin-α, which is required for nuclear import of p65. SpvD interacted specifically with the exportin Xpo2, which mediates nuclear-cytoplasmic recycling of importins. We propose that interaction between SpvD and Xpo2 disrupts the normal recycling of importin-α from the nucleus, leading to a defect in nuclear translocation of p65 and inhibition of activation of NF-ĸB regulated promoters. SpvD down-regulated pro-inflammatory responses and contributed to systemic growth of bacteria in mice. This work shows that a bacterial pathogen can manipulate host cell immune responses by interfering with the nuclear transport machinery.

"Neural tube defects (NTDs) is a general term for central nervous system malformations secondary to a failure of closure or development of the neural tube. The resulting pathologies may involve the brain, spinal cord and/or vertebral column, in addition to associated structures such as soft tissue or skin. The condition is reported among the more common birth defects in humans, leading to significant infant morbidity and mortality. The etiology remains poorly understood but genetic, nutritional, environmental factors, or a combination of these, are known to play a role in the development of NTDs. The variable conditions associated with NTDs occur naturally in dogs, and have been previously reported in the Weimaraner breed. Taking advantage of the strong linkage-disequilibrium within dog breeds we performed genome-wide association analysis and mapped a genomic region for spinal dysraphism, a presumed NTD, using 4 affected and 96 unaffected Weimaraners. The associated region on canine chromosome 8 (pgenome = 3.0×10−5), after 100,000 permutations, encodes 18 genes, including NKX2-8, a homeobox gene which is expressed in the developing neural tube. Sequencing NKX2-8 in affected Weimaraners revealed a G to AA frameshift mutation within exon 2 of the gene, resulting in a premature stop codon that is predicted to produce a truncated protein. The exons of NKX2-8 were sequenced in human patients with spina bifida and rare variants (rs61755040 and rs10135525) were found to be significantly over-represented (p = 0.036). This is the first documentation of a potential role for NKX2-8 in the etiology of NTDs, made possible by investigating the molecular basis of naturally occurring mutations in dogs.
","Neural tube defects (NTDs) are birth defects resulting from errors in the closure of the neural tube, an embryonic structure which develops into tissues of the central nervous system during pregnancy. NTDs commonly lead to costly lifelong disabilities. They are considered to be caused by a combination of nutritional, inherited and environmental factors, and their interactions. However, an obvious mechanism is currently unknown. Genetic studies in human populations are made difficult by the multifactorial nature of NTDs and because multiple cases within a single family are rare. Animal models are helpful in dissecting the genetics of such complex traits; however existing rodent models do not explain all of the NTD cases in humans. Dogs are excellent biomedical models for humans since they receive comparable medical care, share our home environment, and develop naturally occurring diseases comparable to those in humans. We used a naturally occurring NTD in Weimaraner dogs, termed spinal dysraphism, to identify a mutation in an associated regulatory gene, NKX2-8. Mutations in NKX2-8 were subsequently documented in human patients with a generally similar NTD termed spina bifida. This is the first documented evidence that NKX2-8 has a role in NTDs. It is expected that this discovery will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms leading to NTDs.

"Programs for schistosomiasis control are advancing worldwide, with many benefits noted in terms of disease reduction. Yet risk of reinfection and recurrent disease remain, even in areas with high treatment coverage. In the search for means to better prevent new Schistosoma infections, attention has returned to an older strategy for transmission control, i.e., chemical mollusciciding, to suppress intermediate host snail species responsible for S. mansoni and S. haematobium transmission. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize prior experience in molluscicide-based control of Bulinus and Biomphalaria spp. snails, and estimate its impact on local human Schistosoma infection.
The review was registered at inception with PROSPERO (CRD42013006869). Studies were identified by online database searches and hand searches of private archives. Eligible studies included published or unpublished mollusciciding field trials performed before January 2014 involving host snails for S. mansoni or S. haematobium, with a primary focus on the use of niclosamide. Among 63 included papers, there was large variability in terms of molluscicide dosing, and treatment intervals varied from 3–52 weeks depending on location, water source, and type of application. Among 35 studies reporting on prevalence, random effects meta-analysis indicated that, on average, odds of infection were reduced 77% (OR 0.23, CI95% 0.17, 0.31) during the course of mollusciciding, with increased impact if combined with drug therapy, and progressively greater impact over time. In 17 studies reporting local incidence, risk of new infection was reduced 64% (RR 0.36 CI95% 0.25, 0.5), but additional drug treatment did not appear to influence incidence effects.
While there are hurdles to implementing molluscicide control, its impact on local transmission is typically strong, albeit incomplete. Based on past experience, regular focal mollusciciding is likely to contribute significantly to the move toward elimination of schistosomiasis in high risk areas.
","Infection with Schistosoma blood flukes is a leading cause of chronic parasitic disease in at-risk areas of Africa, South America, Asia, and the Philippines. Over past decades, many national programs have implemented regular drug treatment to control or prevent the advanced complications of Schistosoma infection. However, these periodic treatments do not stop transmission of the parasite, which occurs when human sewage contaminates local water bodies and parasite eggs infect intermediate host snails. In this systematic review, we collated past experience of using chemically-mediated snail control for prevention of schistosomiasis. This approach, used in many Schistosoma-affected countries before the advent of the current oral drug regimens, has the potential to significantly reduce transmission if properly applied. Our meta-analysis of 63 studies (performed 1953–1981) catalogued a wide variety of water treatments and schedules employed. Among studies reporting on human infection, we found that snail control reduced local human prevalence and incidence of infection in most, but not all locations. Estimates from the aggregated studies indicate that snail control (alone) typically reduced new infections by 64% and local prevalence declined over a period of years. This decline was accelerated and more profound (84% reduction) if drug treatment was also made available.

"Natural Killer (NK) cells contribute to the control of viral infection by directly killing target cells and mediating cytokine release. In C57BL/6 mice, the Ly49H activating NK cell receptor plays a key role in early resistance to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection through specific recognition of the MCMV-encoded MHC class I-like molecule m157 expressed on infected cells. Here we show that transgenic expression of Ly49H failed to provide protection against MCMV infection in the naturally susceptible A/J mouse strain. Characterization of Ly49H+ NK cells from Ly49h-A transgenic animals showed that they were able to mount a robust cytotoxic response and proliferate to high numbers during the course of infection. However, compared to NK cells from C57BL/6 mice, we observed an intrinsic defect in their ability to produce IFNγ when challenged by either m157-expressing target cells, exogenous cytokines or chemical stimulants. This effect was limited to NK cells as T cells from C57BL/6 and Ly49h-A mice produced comparable cytokine levels. Using a panel of recombinant congenic strains derived from A/J and C57BL/6 progenitors, we mapped the genetic basis of defective IFNγ production to a single 6.6 Mb genetic interval overlapping the Ifng gene on chromosome 10. Inspection of the genetic interval failed to reveal molecular differences between A/J and several mouse strains showing normal IFNγ production. The chromosome 10 locus is independent of MAPK signalling or decreased mRNA stability and linked to MCMV susceptibility. This study highlights the existence of a previously uncovered NK cell-specific cis-regulatory mechanism of Ifnγ transcript expression potentially relevant to NK cell function in health and disease.
","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that largely infects the human population leading to a significant cause of disease and death in the immunocompromised and elderly. The study of CMV in animal models has helped understand the pathogenic consequences of CMV infection and adds substantial understanding of the complex interplay of host and virus in living systems. Natural Killer (NK) cells have emerged as an important player during CMV infection trough their specific recognition of viral particles determinants and subsequent secretion of cytokines and cytolytic granules. In the present study, we have generated different mouse models to specifically investigate quantify viral recognition and cytokine expression by NK cells during CMV infection as a measure of NK cell function. We found that even after proper recognition of infected cells by NK cells, the adequate production of IFNγ is crucial to restrain viral infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that IFNγ production by NK cells is genetically determined and directly linked to the IFNγ locus. Hence, we provide the first evidence for of a unique mechanism of IFNγ production by NK cells which regulates susceptibility to viral infection.

"To better understand dengue fever in the elderly, we compared clinical features, World Health Organization (WHO) dengue classification and outcomes between adult (<60) and elderly (≥60) dengue patients. We explored the impact of co-morbidity and hospital-acquired infection (HAI) on clinical outcomes in the elderly. All patients managed at the Communicable Disease Centre, Singapore, between 2005 and 2008 with positive dengue polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or who fulfilled WHO 1997 or 2009 probable dengue criteria with positive dengue IgM were included.
Of the 6989 cases, 295 (4.4%) were elderly. PCR was positive in 29%. The elderly suffered more severe disease with more dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) (29.2% vs. 21.4%) and severe dengue (SD) (20.3% vs. 14.6%) (p<0.05). Classic dengue symptoms were more common in the adult group. The elderly were less likely to fulfill WHO 1997 (93.6% vs. 96.4%) (p = 0.014), but not WHO 2009 probable dengue (75.3% vs. 71.5%). Time to dengue diagnosis was similar. There was no significant difference in the frequency of warning signs between the two groups, but the elderly were more likely to have hepatomegaly (p = 0.006) and malaise/lethargy (p = 0.033) while the adults had significantly more mucosal bleeding (p<0.001). Intensive care admission occurred in 15 and death in three, with no age difference. Notably, the elderly stayed in hospital longer (median 5 vs. 4 days), and suffered more pneumonia (3.8% vs. 0.7%) and urinary infection (1.9% vs. 0.3%) (p = 0.003). Predictors of excess length of stay were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–2.88), critical illness (aOR 5.13, 95%CI 2.59–9.75), HAI (aOR 12.06, 95%CI 7.39–19.9), Charlson score (aOR 6.9, 95%CI 2.02–22.56) and severe dengue (DHF/dengue shock syndrome/SD) (aOR 2.24, 95%CI 1.83–2.74).
Elderly dengue patients present atypically and are at higher risk of DHF, SD and HAI. Aside from dengue severity, age, co-morbidity and HAI were associated with longer hospital stay.
","Dengue is a neglected tropical disease that is increasingly affecting elderly patients; however, there is a paucity of data on clinical presentation and outcomes in this group. The limited data suggests that elderly dengue patients have the highest case-fatality rate but the pathogenesis of mortality in elderly dengue patients remains unclear. To better understand dengue fever in the elderly we compared clinical features, WHO dengue classification and outcomes between adult (<60) and elderly (≥60) dengue patients and explored the impact of co-morbidity and HAI on clinical outcomes in the elderly. We found that diagnosis in the elderly may be challenging due to atypical presentation. Elderly patients have worse outcomes compared with their younger counterparts with increased rates of DHF and SD. Elderly patients have higher rates of HAI placing them at risk of infection-related mortality. Aside from dengue severity, age, co-morbidity and HAI were associated with longer hospital stay. This will place further burden on already stretched hospital systems.

"DJ-1, a Parkinson's disease (PD)–associated gene, has been shown to protect against oxidative stress in Drosophila. However, the molecular mechanism underlying oxidative stress-induced phenotypes, including apoptosis, locomotive defects, and lethality, in DJ-1-deficient flies is not fully understood. Here we showed that Daxx-like protein (DLP), a Drosophila homologue of the mammalian Death domain-associated protein (Daxx), was upregulated under oxidative stress conditions in the loss-of-function mutants of Drosophila DJ-1β, a Drosophila homologue of DJ-1. DLP overexpression induced apoptosis via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/Drosophila forkhead box subgroup O (dFOXO) pathway, whereas loss of DLP increased resistance to oxidative stress and UV irradiation. Moreover, the oxidative stress-induced phenotypes of DJ-1β mutants were dramatically rescued by DLP deficiency, suggesting that enhanced expression of DLP contributes to the DJ-1β mutant phenotypes. Interestingly, we found that dFOXO was required for the increase in DLP expression in DJ-1β mutants and that dFOXO activity was increased in the heads of DJ-1β mutants. In addition, subcellular localization of DLP appeared to be influenced by DJ-1 expression so that cytosolic DLP was increased in DJ-1β mutants. Similarly, in mammalian cells, Daxx translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol was suppressed by overexpressed DJ-1β under oxidative stress conditions; and, furthermore, targeted expression of DJ-1β to mitochondria efficiently inhibited the Daxx translocation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that DJ-1β protects flies against oxidative stress- and UV-induced apoptosis by regulating the subcellular localization and gene expression of DLP, thus implying that Daxx-induced apoptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of DJ-1-associated PD.
","DJ-1 is an antioxidant protein that has been implicated in autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD), although the mechanism by which DJ-1 deficiency causes PD remains elusive. Drosophila DJ-1 mutants are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and UV irradiation, and oxidative stress-induced cell death is significantly increased in dopaminergic neurons. In this study, we characterized a Drosophila homologue of death domain-associated protein (Daxx), Daxx-like protein (DLP), as a key player in the process of the oxidative stress-induced cell death in DJ-1 mutants. Upon oxidative stress, DLP expression was increased in the DJ-1 mutants, and locomotive defects and oxidative stress-induced phenotypes including apoptosis and lethality were dramatically rescued by DLP deficiency. More interestingly, we revealed that Drosophila forkhead box subgroup O was required for the increased DLP expression in DJ-1 mutants. Additionally, Drosophila DJ-1 suppressed DLP and Daxx translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol in both fly brain and mammalian cells. Interestingly, targeted expression of Drosophila DJ-1 to mitochondria efficiently inhibited Daxx translocation. Our results show that Drosophila DJ-1 protects dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stresses by regulating the subcellular localization and gene expression of DLP, providing a clue to understanding the molecular mechanism underlying oxidative stress-induced neuronal death in PD.

"When multiple samples are taken from the neoplastic tissues of a single patient, it is natural to compare their mutation content. This is often done by bulk genotyping of whole biopsies, but the chance that a mutation will be detected in bulk genotyping depends on its local frequency in the sample. When the underlying mutation count per cell is equal, homogenous biopsies will have more high-frequency mutations, and thus more detectable mutations, than heterogeneous ones. Using simulations, we show that bulk genotyping of data simulated under a neutral model of somatic evolution generates strong spurious evidence for non-neutrality, because the pattern of tissue growth systematically generates differences in biopsy heterogeneity. Any experiment which compares mutation content across bulk-genotyped biopsies may therefore suggest mutation rate or selection intensity variation even when these forces are absent. We discuss computational and experimental approaches for resolving this problem.
","Researchers who take multiple samples from a cancer or pre-cancer tissue and find that some samples show far more mutations than others are likely to conclude that the high-mutation samples reflect cells with an abnormal mutation or growth rate. We considered the common practice of testing a bulk sample for mutations, which finds only mutations that are common within the sample. Our computer simulations show that even when all cells have identical mutation and growth rates, testing bulk samples frequently leads to spurious detection of rate differences. This can lead to false conclusions about the causes and progress of cancer. We discuss possible solutions involving either genetic testing of single cells or the use of computer algorithms to detect rare mutations within a sample.

"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is linked to the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and the neuroinflammatory disease HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLV-1 Tax protein functions as a potent viral oncogene that constitutively activates the NF-κB transcription factor to transform T cells; however, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, using next-generation RNA sequencing we identified the IL-25 receptor subunit IL-17RB as an aberrantly overexpressed gene in HTLV-1 immortalized T cells. Tax induced the expression of IL-17RB in an IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB-dependent manner. Remarkably, Tax activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway in T cells was critically dependent on IL-17RB expression. IL-17RB and IL-25 were required for HTLV-1-induced immortalization of primary T cells, and the constitutive NF-κB activation and survival of HTLV-1 transformed T cells. IL-9 was identified as an important downstream target gene of the IL-17RB pathway that drives the proliferation of HTLV-1 transformed cells. Furthermore, IL-17RB was overexpressed in leukemic cells from a subset of ATL patients and also regulated NF-κB activation in some, but not all, Tax-negative ATL cell lines. Together, our results support a model whereby Tax instigates an IL-17RB-NF-κB feed-forward autocrine loop that is obligatory for HTLV-1 leukemogenesis.
","The retrovirus HTLV-1 is the causative agent of an aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder known as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The HTLV-1 Tax regulatory protein constitutively activates the host NF-κB transcription factor to promote T-cell proliferation, survival and cell transformation. However, it remains unknown precisely how Tax persistently activates NF-κB in T cells. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to identify genes that were differentially expressed upon HTLV-1 infection and immortalization of primary T cells. We found that IL-17RB, the receptor for the IL-25 cytokine, was highly induced in HTLV-1 transformed T cells and was required for NF-κB activation, cell proliferation and survival. Tax induced the expression of IL-17RB and established a positive feedback loop together with IL-25 that triggered persistent NF-κB activation and the upregulation of IL-9 and other genes critical for T-cell proliferation and survival. IL-17RB was also overexpressed in a subset of acute ATL patient specimens and therefore may potentially be targeted by monoclonal antibodies as a novel ATL therapy.

"Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, poses a significant global public health risk. In tropical countries such as India where periodic dengue outbreaks can be correlated to the high prevalence of the mosquito vector, circulation of all four dengue viruses (DENVs) and the high population density, a drug for dengue is being increasingly recognized as an unmet public health need.
Using the knowledge of traditional Indian medicine, Ayurveda, we developed a systematic bioassay-guided screening approach to explore the indigenous herbal bio-resource to identify plants with pan-DENV inhibitory activity. Our results show that the alcoholic extract of Cissampelos pariera Linn (Cipa extract) was a potent inhibitor of all four DENVs in cell-based assays, assessed in terms of viral NS1 antigen secretion using ELISA, as well as viral replication, based on plaque assays. Virus yield reduction assays showed that Cipa extract could decrease viral titers by an order of magnitude. The extract conferred statistically significant protection against DENV infection using the AG129 mouse model. A preliminary evaluation of the clinical relevance of Cipa extract showed that it had no adverse effects on platelet counts and RBC viability. In addition to inherent antipyretic activity in Wistar rats, it possessed the ability to down-regulate the production of TNF-α, a cytokine implicated in severe dengue disease. Importantly, it showed no evidence of toxicity in Wistar rats, when administered at doses as high as 2g/Kg body weight for up to 1 week.
Our findings above, taken in the context of the human safety of Cipa, based on its use in Indian traditional medicine, warrant further work to explore Cipa as a source for the development of an inexpensive herbal formulation for dengue therapy. This may be of practical relevance to a dengue-endemic resource-poor country such as India.
","India represents ~50% of the global population estimated to be at risk of dengue. Severe dengue, which is potentially fatal, correlates with very high virus load, reduction in platelet counts and haemorrhage. Antiviral therapy to reduce high virus load may be beneficial in attenuating disease severity. We have explored Indian traditional medicine, Ayurveda, to identify plants that could be a source of dengue inhibitory activity. We show that an alcoholic extract prepared from Cissampelos pareira Linn inhibited the replication of dengue viruses in living cells in culture and protected mice against dengue infection. It also showed antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. Importantly, this extract did not show any toxic effects in rats and did not affect platelets and red blood cells. This observation is critical as dengue fever is commonly treated with antipyretics. In a dengue-endemic resource-poor country as India, the C. pareira plant may serve as a source for the development of an inexpensive herbal formulation against dengue.

"Cooperation in social dilemmas is essential for the functioning of systems at multiple levels of complexity, from the simplest biological organisms to the most sophisticated human societies. Cooperation, although widespread, is fundamentally challenging to explain evolutionarily, since natural selection typically favors selfish behavior which is not socially optimal. Here we study the evolution of cooperation in three exemplars of key social dilemmas, representing the prisoner’s dilemma, hawk-dove and coordination classes of games, in structured populations defined by complex networks. Using individual-based simulations of the games on model and empirical networks, we give a detailed comparative study of the effects of the structural properties of a network, such as its average degree, variance in degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and assortativity coefficient, on the promotion of cooperative behavior in all three classes of games.
","Social dilemmas embody the tension between individual self-interest on the one hand and the public good on the other that underlie many of the greatest challenges facing human and animal societies, such as the maintenance of altruism and the responsible use of common resources. Understanding the mechanisms through which cooperative, socially optimal, behavior can be established in social dilemmas is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology and in many areas of the social sciences. Here we study how cooperative behavior can emerge in three key social dilemmas—known as the donation game, snowdrift game and sculling game—when interactions between individuals form a network. We show that in all three social dilemmas significantly higher levels of cooperative behavior typically emerge in such a situation as compared to what would be the case in the absence of any network structure. In particular, we show that certain structural properties that are common in real-world social networks have a significant effect in increasing the level of cooperative behavior that is present in all three social dilemmas.

"Cationic amino acid transporters (CAT) are important regulators of NOS2 and ARG1 activity because they regulate L-arginine availability. However, their role in the development of Th1/Th2 effector functions following infection has not been investigated. Here we dissect the function of CAT2 by studying two infectious disease models characterized by the development of polarized Th1 or Th2-type responses. We show that CAT2−/− mice are significantly more susceptible to the Th1-inducing pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. Although T. gondii infected CAT2−/− mice developed stronger IFN-γ responses, nitric oxide (NO) production was significantly impaired, which contributed to their enhanced susceptibility. In contrast, CAT2−/− mice infected with the Th2-inducing pathogen Schistosoma mansoni displayed no change in susceptibility to infection, although they succumbed to schistosomiasis at an accelerated rate. Granuloma formation and fibrosis, pathological features regulated by Th2 cytokines, were also exacerbated even though their Th2 response was reduced. Finally, while IL-13 blockade was highly efficacious in wild-type mice, the development of fibrosis in CAT2−/− mice was largely IL-13-independent. Instead, the exacerbated pathology was associated with increased arginase activity in fibroblasts and alternatively activated macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, by controlling NOS2 and arginase activity, CAT2 functions as a potent regulator of immunity.
","Recent studies conducted with amino transporter Slc7a2-deficient mice (CAT2) demonstrated that NOS2 activity in macrophages is regulated by CAT2. NOS2, which synthesizes nitric oxide, regulates numerous important activities, including resistance to infectious organisms, tumor development, and autoimmune diseases. It also competes with the enzyme Arginase-1 (Arg1) for the common substrate L-arginine. However, the role CAT2 in the regulation of Arg1 activity has not been previously examined. Therefore, we infected CAT2-deficient mice with the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni or with the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, two organisms that trigger highly divergent host immune responses. Strikingly, following infection with S. mansoni, CAT2−/− mice developed parasite egg–induced lesions in the liver that were 3 to 4 times larger than wild type and hepatic fibrosis (a feature of severe schistosomiasis) was exacerbated, indicating a general worsening of disease in the absence of CAT2. The CAT2−/− mice were also more susceptible to T. gondii infection, demonstrating that CAT2 is critical for the development of protective cell-mediated immunity. Thus, these studies identify CAT2 as a powerful regulator of host immune responses, which may have major implications for a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.

"Mycolactone, the macrolide exotoxin produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, causes extensive tissue destruction by inducing apoptosis of host cells. In this study, we aimed at the production of antibodies that could neutralize the cytotoxic activities of mycolactone.
Using the B cell hybridoma technology, we generated a series of monoclonal antibodies with specificity for mycolactone from spleen cells of mice immunized with the protein conjugate of a truncated synthetic mycolactone derivative. L929 fibroblasts were used as a model system to investigate whether these antibodies can inhibit the biological effects of mycolactone. By measuring the metabolic activity of the fibroblasts, we found that anti-mycolactone mAbs can completely neutralize the cytotoxic activity of mycolactone.
The toxin neutralizing capacity of anti-mycolactone mAbs supports the concept of evaluating the macrolide toxin as vaccine target.
","Mycolactones A/B (also simply referred to as mycolactone) are macrolide exotoxins produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of the neglected tropical skin disease Buruli ulcer (BU). The potent cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities of mycolactones lead to severe destruction of the subcutaneous fat tissue with minimal inflammation in the core of the lesion. Due to the lipid-like nature of mycolactones, the production of antibodies against these molecules has so far been unsuccessful. By using the classical approach of fusing immortal cells with spleen cells of mice immunized with a protein conjugate of a truncated non-toxic synthetic mycolactone, we were able to generate hybridoma cells producing mycolactone-specific monoclonal antibodies. Mammalian cell-based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that these antibodies have neutralizing activity and can fully block the cytotoxic activity of mycolactone, resulting in survival of the target cells. These findings support the concept to target mycolactone by a vaccine. Furthermore, the anti-mycolactone antibodies may represent useful tools for BU diagnostics development.

"Kinetic models of metabolic networks offer the promise of quantitative phenotype prediction. The mechanistic characterization of enzyme catalyzed reactions allows for tracing the effect of perturbations in metabolite concentrations and reaction fluxes in response to genetic and environmental perturbation that are beyond the scope of stoichiometric models. In this study, we develop a two-step computational pipeline for the rapid parameterization of kinetic models of metabolic networks using a curated metabolic model and available 13C-labeling distributions under multiple genetic and environmental perturbations. The first step involves the elucidation of all intracellular fluxes in a core model of E. coli containing 74 reactions and 61 metabolites using 13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C-MFA). Here, fluxes corresponding to the mid-exponential growth phase are elucidated for seven single gene deletion mutants from upper glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The computed flux ranges are then used to parameterize the same (i.e., k-ecoli74) core kinetic model for E. coli with 55 substrate-level regulations using the newly developed K-FIT parameterization algorithm. The K-FIT algorithm employs a combination of equation decomposition and iterative solution techniques to evaluate steady-state fluxes in response to genetic perturbations. k-ecoli74 predicted 86% of flux values for strains used during fitting within a single standard deviation of 13C-MFA estimated values. By performing both tasks using the same network, errors associated with lack of congruity between the two networks are avoided, allowing for seamless integration of data with model building. Product yield predictions and comparison with previously developed kinetic models indicate shifts in flux ranges and the presence or absence of mutant strains delivering flux towards pathways of interest from training data significantly impact predictive capabilities. Using this workflow, the impact of completeness of fluxomic datasets and the importance of specific genetic perturbations on uncertainties in kinetic parameter estimation are evaluated.
","Microbial production hosts are used for production of a wide range of commodity chemicals. Improving the conversion efficiency of microbial strains is critical to the economic viability and the continued push towards the use of environmentally neutral bioprocesses as a means for producing the chemicals society depends on. Metabolic models have played a key role in helping us to predict metabolic behavior in response to environmental and genetic perturbation that can maximize efficiency. Recently, kinetic models of metabolism have re-emerged as a means for characterizing metabolism, offering improvements over their stoichiometric counterparts in both the type of information that can be gleaned from them, and in prediction accuracy. Despite recent developments, a lack of raw experimental data needed for flux elucidation and, subsequently, kinetic parameterization, and high computation cost have prevented the development of a uniform workflow for construction of the most informative kinetic models. Here, we have incorporated raw 13C-isotopic labeling data and a computationally inexpensive parameterization algorithm into a kinetic parameterization pipeline to ensure that the resulting kinetic model (k-ecoli74) conforms to experimental data. We show how the use of an identical metabolic network for flux elucidation and kinetic parameterization influences predictive capabilities.

"There is evidence to suggest that the yaws bacterium (Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue) may exist in non-human primate populations residing in regions where yaws is endemic in humans. Especially in light of the fact that the World Health Organizaiton (WHO) recently launched its second yaws eradication campaign, there is a considerable need for reliable tools to identify treponemal infection in our closest relatives, African monkeys and great apes. It was hypothesized that commercially available serological tests detect simian anti-T. pallidum antibody in serum samples of baboons, with comparable sensitivity and specificity to their results on human sera. Test performances of five different treponemal tests (TTs) and two non-treponemal tests (NTTs) were evaluated using serum samples of 57 naturally T. pallidum-infected olive baboons (Papio anubis) from Lake Manyara National Park in Tanzania. The T. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TP-PA) was used as a gold standard for comparison. In addition, the overall infection status of the animals was used to further validate test performances. For most accurate results, only samples that originated from baboons of known infection status, as verified in a previous study by clinical inspection, PCR and immunohistochemistry, were included. All tests, TTs and NTTs, used in this study were able to reliably detect antibodies against T. pallidum in serum samples of infected baboons. The sensitivity of TTs ranged from 97.7-100%, while specificity was between 88.0-100.0%. The two NTTs detected anti-lipoidal antibodies in serum samples of infected baboons with a sensitivity of 83.3% whereas specificity was 100%. For screening purposes, the TT Espline TP provided the highest sensitivity and specificity and at the same time provided the most suitable format for use in the field. The enzyme immune assay Mastblot TP (IgG), however, could be considered as a confirmatory test.
","The success of any disease eradication campaign depends on considering possible non-human reservoirs of the disease. Although the first report of T. pallidum infection in baboons was published in the 1970’s and the zoonotic potential was demonstrated by inoculation of a West African simian strain into humans, nonhuman primates have not yet been considered as a possible reservoir for re-emerging yaws in Africa. Simian strains are genetically most closely related to the strains that cause yaws in humans. The identification of baboons as a reservoir for human infection in Africa would be revolutionary and aid important aspects to yaws eradication programs. Reliable serological tests and a useful standardized test algorithm for the screening of wild baboon populations are essential for studying potential transmission events between monkeys and humans.

"Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc. Prion strains are hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrPSc and prions can interfere with each other when a long-incubation period strain (i.e. blocking strain) inhibits the conversion of a short-incubation period strain (i.e. non-blocking). Prion strain interference influences prion strain dynamics and the emergence of a strain from a mixture; however, it is unknown if two long-incubation period strains can interfere with each other. Here, we show that co-infection of animals with combinations of long-incubation period strains failed to identify evidence of strain interference. To exclude the possibility that this inability of strains to interfere in vivo was due to a failure to infect common populations of neurons we used protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCAsi). Consistent with the animal bioassay studies, PMCAsi indicated that both co-infecting strains were amplifying independently, suggesting that the lack of strain interference is not due to a failure to target the same cells but is an inherent property of the strains involved. Importantly PMCA reactions seeded with long incubation-period strains contained relatively higher levels of remaining PrPC compared to reactions seeded with a short-incubation period strain. Mechanistically, we hypothesize the abundance of PrPC is not limiting in vivo or in vitro resulting in prion strains with relatively low prion conversion efficiency to amplify independently. Overall, this observation changes the paradigm of the interactions of prion strains and has implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture.
","This is the first example of prion strains that replicate independently in vitro and in vivo. This observation changes the paradigm of the interactions of prion strains and provides further evidence that strains are a dynamic mixture of substrains. Strain interference is influenced by the abundance of PrPC that is convertible by the strains involved. These observations have implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture.

"Leishmaniasis is a debilitating disease caused by the parasite Leishmania. There is extensive clinical polymorphism, including variable responsiveness to treatment. We study Leishmania donovani parasites isolated from visceral leishmaniasis patients in Nepal that responded differently to antimonial treatment due to differing intrinsic drug sensitivity of the parasites. Here, we present a proof-of-principle study in which we applied a metabolomics pipeline specifically developed for L. donovani to characterize the global metabolic differences between antimonial-sensitive and antimonial-resistant L. donovani isolates. Clones of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasite isolates from clinical samples were cultured in vitro and harvested for metabolomics analysis. The relative abundance of 340 metabolites was determined by ZIC-HILIC chromatography coupled to LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Our measurements cover approximately 20% of the predicted core metabolome of Leishmania and additionally detected a large number of lipids. Drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasites showed distinct metabolic profiles, and unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis clearly distinguished the two phenotypes. For 100 metabolites, the detected intensity differed more than three-fold between the 2 phenotypes. Many of these were in specific areas of lipid metabolism, suggesting that the membrane composition of the drug-resistant parasites is extensively modified. Untargeted metabolomics has been applied on clinical Leishmania isolates to uncover major metabolic differences between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant isolates. The identified major differences provide novel insights into the mechanisms involved in resistance to antimonial drugs, and facilitate investigations using targeted approaches to unravel the key changes mediating drug resistance.
","Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by a parasite called Leishmania donovani, which every year infects about half a million people and claims several thousand lives. Existing treatments are now becoming less effective due to the emergence of drug resistance. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms used by the parasite to adapt to drugs and achieve resistance is crucial for developing future treatment strategies. Unfortunately, the biological mechanism whereby Leishmania acquires drug resistance is poorly understood. Recent years have brought new technologies with the potential to increase greatly our understanding of drug resistance mechanisms. The latest mass spectrometry techniques allow the metabolome of parasites to be studied rapidly and in great detail. We have applied this approach to determine the metabolome of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasites isolated from patients with leishmaniasis. The data show that there are wholesale differences between the isolates and that the membrane composition has been drastically modified in drug-resistant parasites compared with drug-sensitive parasites. Our findings demonstrate that untargeted metabolomics has great potential to identify major metabolic differences between closely related parasite strains and thus should find many applications in distinguishing parasite phenotypes of clinical relevance.

"An increasing number of neuroscience papers capitalize on the assumption published in this journal that visual speech would be typically 150 ms ahead of auditory speech. It happens that the estimation of audiovisual asynchrony in the reference paper is valid only in very specific cases, for isolated consonant-vowel syllables or at the beginning of a speech utterance, in what we call “preparatory gestures”. However, when syllables are chained in sequences, as they are typically in most parts of a natural speech utterance, asynchrony should be defined in a different way. This is what we call “comodulatory gestures” providing auditory and visual events more or less in synchrony. We provide audiovisual data on sequences of plosive-vowel syllables (pa, ta, ka, ba, da, ga, ma, na) showing that audiovisual synchrony is actually rather precise, varying between 20 ms audio lead and 70 ms audio lag. We show how more complex speech material should result in a range typically varying between 40 ms audio lead and 200 ms audio lag, and we discuss how this natural coordination is reflected in the so-called temporal integration window for audiovisual speech perception. Finally we present a toy model of auditory and audiovisual predictive coding, showing that visual lead is actually not necessary for visual prediction.
","Since a paper was published in this journal, an increasing number of neuroscience papers capitalize on the assumption that visual speech would be typically 150 ms ahead of auditory speech. It happens that the estimation of audiovisual asynchrony in the mentioned paper is valid only in very specific cases, for isolated consonant-vowel syllables or at the beginning of a speech utterance. But the view that vision leads audition is globally oversimplified and often wrong. It should be replaced by the acknowledgement that the temporal relationship between auditory and visual cues is complex, including a range of configurations more or less reflected by the temporal integration window from 30 to 50 ms auditory lead to 170 to 200 ms visual lead. This has important consequences for computational models of audiovisual speech processing in the human brain.

"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing adjusts the transcriptional output of the genome by generating related mRNAs from a single primary transcript, thereby expanding protein diversity. A fundamental unanswered question is how splicing factors achieve specificity in the selection of target substrates despite the recognition of information-poor sequence motifs. The CUGBP2 splicing regulator plays a key role in the brain region-specific silencing of the NI exon of the NMDA R1 receptor. However, the sequence motifs utilized by this factor for specific target exon selection and its role in splicing silencing are not understood. Here, we use chemical modification footprinting to map the contact sites of CUGBP2 to GU-rich motifs closely positioned at the boundaries of the branch sites of the NI exon, and we demonstrate a mechanistic role for this specific arrangement of motifs for the regulation of branchpoint formation. General support for a branch site-perimeter–binding model is indicated by the identification of a group of novel target exons with a similar configuration of motifs that are silenced by CUGBP2. These results reveal an autoregulatory role for CUGBP2 as indicated by its direct interaction with functionally significant RNA motifs surrounding the branch sites upstream of exon 6 of the CUGBP2 transcript itself. The perimeter-binding model explains how CUGBP2 can effectively embrace the branch site region to achieve the specificity needed for the selection of exon targets and the fine-tuning of alternative splicing patterns.
","Alternative splicing is a precisely controlled process that determines whether an exon will be included or skipped in the mature mRNA transcript. Factors that control alternative splicing bind to RNA sequence motifs in the exon or flanking introns and guide tissue and developmental specific splicing events. CUGBP2 is a dual functional regulator of alternative splicing that can cause inclusion or skipping of a target exon, depending on the context of its binding motifs. Previously, the mechanisms of regulation by this protein and the positional significance of its target motifs have not been characterized. In this study, the authors dissected the mechanism of exon skipping by CUGBP2 and demonstrate that a specific configuration of motifs at the perimeters of a functional reference point are intimately involved in this event. Furthermore, this mechanism of regulation is shown to have general significance because novel CUGBP2 target exons contain a similar arrangement of motifs. The most interesting of this group is an exon within the CUGBP2 transcript itself. This study underscores the importance of a functional reference point in the specificity of regulation by an alternative splicing factor and reveals a novel autoregulatory role for CUGBP2.

"The Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is crucial for the development of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), a highly malignant CD4+ T cell neoplasm. Among the multiple aberrant Tax-induced effects on cellular processes, persistent activation of transcription factor NF-κB, which is activated only transiently upon physiological stimulation, is essential for leukemogenesis. We and others have shown that Tax induces activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is a critical step in NF-κB activation, by generating Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Tax-induced IKK activation is controversial and not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Tax recruits linear (Met1-linked) ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to the IKK complex and that Tax fails to induce IKK activation in cells that lack LUBAC activity. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that both Lys63-linked and Met1-linked polyubiquitin chains are associated with the IKK complex. Furthermore, treatment of the IKK-associated polyubiquitin chains with Met1-linked-chain-specific deubiquitinase (OTULIN) resulted in the reduction of high molecular weight polyubiquitin chains and the generation of short Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains, indicating that Tax can induce the generation of Lys63- and Met1-linked hybrid polyubiquitin chains. We also demonstrate that Tax induces formation of the active macromolecular IKK complex and that the blocking of Tax-induced polyubiquitin chain synthesis inhibited formation of the macromolecular complex. Taken together, these results lead us to propose a novel model in which the hybrid-chain-dependent oligomerization of the IKK complex triggered by Tax leads to trans-autophosphorylation-mediated IKK activation.
","NF-κB is a key transcription factor that regulates many physiologically important cellular processes. However, persistent activation of NF-κB leads to chronic inflammation, autoimmunity and malignancy. Infection with the human retrovirus HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia, and HTLV-1 Tax-mediated persistent NF-κB activation is crucial for leukemogenesis. Therefore, a better understanding of the precise mechanism underlying aberrant NF-κB activation is essential to develop new therapeutic approaches. Ubiquitination is one of the major post-translational modifications that regulate various intracellular signaling pathways. We and others have shown that Tax activates NF-κB through activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex by generating Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Tax-induced IKK activation remains less well understood. Here, we demonstrate precisely how HTLV-1 Tax utilizes the ubiquitin system to activate the IKK complex. The IKK complex-associated Lys63/Met1-linked hybrid polyubiquitin chains are generated through the Tax-mediated recruitment of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to the IKK complex. Furthermore, the hybrid chains are required for the Tax-induced formation of the active macromolecular IKK complex. Accordingly, we propose a novel model in which Tax triggers Lys63/Met1-linked hybrid-chain-dependent oligomerization of the IKK complex, leading to trans-autophosphorylation-mediated IKK activation.

"The impact of exposure to multiple pathogens concurrently or consecutively on immune function is unclear. Here, immune responses induced by combinations of the bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) and the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), which causes a murine hookworm infection and an experimental porin protein vaccine against STm, were examined.
Mice infected with both STm and Nb induced similar numbers of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes compared with singly infected mice, as determined by flow cytometry, although lower levels of secreted Th2, but not Th1 cytokines were detected by ELISA after re-stimulation of splenocytes. Furthermore, the density of FoxP3+ T cells in the T zone of co-infected mice was lower compared to mice that only received Nb, but was greater than those that received STm. This reflected the intermediate levels of IL-10 detected from splenocytes. Co-infection compromised clearance of both pathogens, with worms still detectable in mice weeks after they were cleared in the control group. Despite altered control of bacterial and helminth colonization in co-infected mice, robust extrafollicular Th1 and Th2-reflecting immunoglobulin-switching profiles were detected, with IgG2a, IgG1 and IgE plasma cells all detected in parallel. Whilst extrafollicular antibody responses were maintained in the first weeks after co-infection, the GC response was less than that in mice infected with Nb only. Nb infection resulted in some abrogation of the longer-term development of anti-STm IgG responses. This suggested that prior Nb infection may modulate the induction of protective antibody responses to vaccination. To assess this we immunized mice with porins, which confer protection in an antibody-dependent manner, before challenging with STm. Mice that had resolved a Nb infection prior to immunization induced less anti-porin IgG and had compromised protection against infection.
These findings demonstrate that co-infection can radically alter the development of protective immunity during natural infection and in response to immunization.
","Vaccination studies in animal models have focused on understanding responses in young, previously naïve mice. In reality, humans are vaccinated or respond to infection in the context of a life-time of accumulated exposure to multiple, systemic infections and other vaccines, some of which are themselves attenuated live organisms. This is even more pronounced in areas that are endemic for infectious diseases. We wished to examine the impact infectious history can have on the immune response against infection and the efficacy of vaccination. To do this, we used two classes of pathogens that model clinically important invasive infections. One pathogen is the bacterium, Salmonella Typhimurium against which we have also developed an experimental porin vaccine, and the second is an invasive helminth, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, that models aspects of hookworm infections. Our studies indicate that exposure to a second, unrelated pathogen can reduce the efficiency of immunity generated during natural infection and immunity generated after vaccination. These results are important as they help to identify potential strategies for improving immune-mediated control of infection and the success of vaccination in infection-endemic regions.

"Accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis relies on the presence of crossover events distributed among all chromosomes. MutSγ and MutLγ homologs (Msh4/5 and Mlh1/3) facilitate the formation of a prominent group of meiotic crossovers that mature within the context of an elaborate chromosomal structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC). SC proteins are required for intermediate steps in the formation of MutSγ-MutLγ crossovers, but whether the assembled SC structure per se is required for MutSγ-MutLγ-dependent crossover recombination events is unknown. Here we describe an interspecies complementation experiment that reveals that the mature SC is dispensable for the formation of Mlh3-dependent crossovers in budding yeast. Zip1 forms a major structural component of the budding yeast SC, and is also required for MutSγ and MutLγ-dependent crossover formation. Kluyveromyces lactis ZIP1 expressed in place of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ZIP1 in S. cerevisiae cells fails to support SC assembly (synapsis) but promotes wild-type crossover levels in those nuclei that progress to form spores. While stable, full-length SC does not assemble in S. cerevisiae cells expressing K. lactis ZIP1, aggregates of K. lactis Zip1 displayed by S. cerevisiae meiotic nuclei are decorated with SC-associated proteins, and K. lactis Zip1 promotes the SUMOylation of the SC central element protein Ecm11, suggesting that K. lactis Zip1 functionally interfaces with components of the S. cerevisiae synapsis machinery. Moreover, K. lactis Zip1-mediated crossovers rely on S. cerevisiae synapsis initiation proteins Zip3, Zip4, Spo16, as well as the Mlh3 protein, as do the crossovers mediated by S. cerevisiae Zip1. Surprisingly, however, K. lactis Zip1-mediated crossovers are largely Msh4/Msh5 (MutSγ)-independent. This separation-of-function version of Zip1 thus reveals that neither assembled SC nor MutSγ is required for Mlh3-dependent crossover formation per se in budding yeast. Our data suggest that features of S. cerevisiae Zip1 or of the assembled SC in S. cerevisiae normally constrain MutLγ to preferentially promote resolution of MutSγ-associated recombination intermediates.
","At the heart of reproductive cell formation is a nuclear division process (meiosis) whereby homologous chromosomes segregate from one another. Meiotic partner chromosomes establish exclusive associations via a patterned distribution of crossover recombination events. During the maturation of recombination intermediates into crossovers, homologous axes are aligned in the context of a striking proteinaceous structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC). While genetic data link the SC with crossovers, it is unclear whether the mature SC structure facilitates crossover formation. Here we describe an interspecies complementation experiment in which we replace the S. cerevisiae version of an SC structural protein with an ancestrally related version from K. lactis. Our experiment reveals that, while SC proteins are required, mature full-length SC is dispensable for the formation of SC-associated crossovers in budding yeast. We furthermore discovered that most, but not all, members of a conserved meiotic crossover pathway are required for the crossovers that form in this interspecies context. Our findings strengthen the notion that a primary function of many SC proteins is to facilitate crossover recombination, independent of a role in building the larger SC structure. Furthermore, these data suggest that during normal meiosis in S. cerevisiae the assembled SC may act to functionally couple key crossover recombination proteins to one another.

"Macrocyclic lactones (MLs) are widely used parasiticides against nematodes and arthropods, but resistance is frequently observed in parasitic nematodes of horses and livestock. Reports claiming resistance or decreased susceptibility in human nematodes are increasing. Since no target site directed ML resistance mechanisms have been identified, non-specific mechanisms were frequently implicated in ML resistance, including P-glycoproteins (Pgps, designated ABCB1 in vertebrates). Nematode genomes encode many different Pgps (e.g. 10 in the sheep parasite Haemonchus contortus). ML transport was shown for mammalian Pgps, Pgps on nematode egg shells, and very recently for Pgp-2 of H. contortus. Here, Pgp-9 from the equine parasite Cylicocyclus elongatus (Cyathostominae) was expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking seven endogenous efflux transporters. Pgp was detected on these yeasts by flow cytometry and chemiluminescence using the monoclonal antibody UIC2, which is specific for the active Pgp conformation. In a growth assay, Pgp-9 increased resistance to the fungicides ketoconazole, actinomycin D, valinomycin and daunorubicin, but not to the anthelmintic fungicide thiabendazole. Since no fungicidal activity has been described for MLs, their interaction with Pgp-9 was investigated in an assay involving two drugs: Yeasts were incubated with the highest ketoconazole concentration not affecting growth plus increasing concentrations of MLs to determine competition between or modulation of transport of both drugs. Already equimolar concentrations of ivermectin and eprinomectin inhibited growth, and at fourfold higher ML concentrations growth was virtually abolished. Selamectin and doramectin did not increase susceptibility to ketoconazole at all, although doramectin has been shown previously to strongly interact with human and canine Pgp. An intermediate interaction was observed for moxidectin. This was substantiated by increased binding of UIC2 antibodies in the presence of ivermectin, moxidectin, daunorubicin and ketoconazole but not selamectin. These results demonstrate direct effects of MLs on a recombinant nematode Pgp in an ML-specific manner.
","Macrocyclic lactones (MLs) are widely used drugs against parasitic nematodes, but drug resistance is rapidly increasing in prevalence and spatial distribution in parasites of ruminants and horses, and is suspected in human nematodes after mass drug applications. Changes in expression levels or the amino acid sequences of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transporters have frequently been implicated in ML resistance, but direct evidence for transport of MLs by nematode Pgps is still missing. Here, cloning of pgp-9 of the equine parasite Cylicocyclus elongatus and its functional recombinant expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain deficient in seven endogenous ABC transporters is described. Expression decreased susceptibility to several fungicidal mammalian Pgp substrates including e.g. actinomycin D and ketoconazole, but had no influence on susceptibility to the benzimidazole thiabendazole, which is active against both, yeasts and nematodes. Addition of some MLs strongly increased ketoconazole susceptibility in yeasts expressing C. elongatus Pgp-9, while other MLs had no effect. These interactions are a strong hint that some MLs act as substrates or at least as inhibitors of Pgp-9 mediated drug transport.

"Strongyloides stercoralis, the chief causative agent of human strongyloidiasis, is a nematode globally distributed but mainly endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. Chronic infection is often clinically asymptomatic but it can result in severe hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated strongyloidiasis in immunocompromised patients. There is a great diversity of techniques used in diagnosing the disease, but definitive diagnosis is accomplished by parasitological examination of stool samples for morphological identification of parasite. Until now, no molecular method has been tested in urine samples as an alternative to stool samples for diagnosing strongyloidiasis. This study aimed to evaluate the use of a new molecular LAMP assay in a well-established Wistar rat experimental infection model using both stool and, for the first time, urine samples. The LAMP assay was also clinically evaluated in patients´ stool samples.
Stool and urine samples were obtained daily during a 28-day period from rats infected subcutaneously with different infective third-stage larvae doses of S. venezuelensis. The dynamics of parasite infection was determined by daily counting the number of eggs per gram of feces from day 1 to 28 post-infection. A set of primers for LAMP assay based on a DNA partial sequence in the 18S rRNA gene from S. venezuelensis was designed. The set up LAMP assay (namely, Strong-LAMP) allowed the sensitive detection of S. venezuelensis DNA in both stool and urine samples obtained from each infection group of rats and was also effective in S. stercoralis DNA amplification in patients´ stool samples with previously confirmed strongyloidiasis by parasitological and real-time PCR tests.
Our Strong-LAMP assay is an useful molecular tool in research of a strongyloidiasis experimental infection model in both stool and urine samples. After further validation, the Strong-LAMP could also be potentially applied for effective diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in a clinical setting.
","Human strongyloidiasis, a soil-transmitted infection mainly caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, is one of the most neglected among the so-called neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The difficult diagnosis lead to an underreporting of infection rates. Strongyloidiasis can easily be misdiagnosed because many infections remain asymptomatic and the lack of sensitivity of the conventional fecal-based techniques for morphologically identification of infective larvae in feces. Although serologic tests are useful, a limitation in standardization to avoid cross-reactions still remains. There is an urgent need to improve more sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly in immunocompromised patients or candidates to immunosuppressive treatments. Several molecular approaches for Strongyloides spp. DNA detection have already been assayed, but they have a very limited use in routine diagnostic, particularly in endemic areas. In addition, all molecular approaches for Strongyloides spp. DNA detection have always been mainly assayed for stool samples and no other more advantageous biological samples, such as urine, have been investigated for molecular purposes. In this study we have developed, for the first time, a molecular assay using LAMP methodology as a simple, sensible and robust method for the detection of S. venezuelensis DNA in a well-established Wistar rats experimental infection in both stool and urine samples. The LAMP assay was also successfully evaluated in patients´ stool samples. Our LAMP assay (Strong-LAMP) is an useful molecular tool in a strongyloidiasis experimental infection model and could be a potential field-friendly diagnostic test in a clinical setting, following further validation.

"Blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma infect over 200 million people, causing granulomatous pathology with accompanying morbidity and mortality. As a consequence of extensive host-parasite co-evolution, schistosomes exhibit a complex relationship with their hosts, in which immunological factors are intimately linked with parasite development. Schistosomes fail to develop normally in immunodeficient mice, an outcome specifically dependent on the absence of CD4+ T cells. The role of CD4+ T cells in parasite development is indirect and mediated by interaction with innate cells, as repeated toll-like receptor 4 stimulation is sufficient to restore parasite development in immunodeficient mice in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Here we show that repeated stimulation of innate immunity by an endogenous danger signal can also restore parasite development and that both these stimuli, when administered repeatedly, lead to the regulation of innate responses. Supporting a role for regulation of innate responses in parasite development, we show that regulation of inflammation by neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies also restores parasite development in immunodeficient mice. Finally, we show that administration of IL-4 to immunodeficient mice to regulate inflammation by induction of type 2 responses also restores parasite development. These findings suggest that the type 2 response driven by CD4+ T cells during pre-patent infection of immunocompetent hosts is exploited by schistosomes to complete their development to reproductively mature adult parasites.
","Schistosomiasis is a devastating disease caused by Schistosoma blood flukes and is a leading parasitic cause of morbidity and mortality in the Developing World. The regulation of inflammatory responses to schistosome eggs trapped in tissues is critical for host survival and is established before egg deposition begins, with the production of the cytokine IL-4 being a hallmark of this process. Here we show that regulation of inflammatory responses also contributes to the development of schistosomes into egg-laying adult parasites. We demonstrate that failure of schistosome development in immunodeficient mice correlates with the absence of the chronic liver inflammation and subsequent immune regulation found in infected wild type mice. Restoration of liver inflammation in immunodeficient mice by repeated administration of liver toxins restored parasite development. Repeated administration of an endogenous inflammatory stimulus also restored parasite development, and also restored aspects of the immune regulation found in wild type mice. Finally, administration of IL-4 alone to immunodeficient animals also restored parasite development and the regulation of inflammation. We propose that schistosomes require immune regulation of inflammation to develop in the hostile immune environment within their hosts. Hence, targeting regulation of inflammation may represent a novel approach to treating or preventing schistosome infections.

"Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is a devastating skin disease, occurring mainly in remote West African communities with poor access to health care. Early case detection and subsequent antibiotic treatment are essential to counteract the progression of the characteristic chronic ulcerative lesions. Since the accuracy of clinical BU diagnosis is limited, laboratory reconfirmation is crucial. However, currently available diagnostic techniques with sufficient sensitivity and specificity require infrastructure and resources only accessible at a few reference centres in the African endemic countries. Hence, the development of a simple, rapid, sensitive and specific point-of-care diagnostic tool is one of the major research priorities for BU. In this study, we have identified a previously unknown M. ulcerans protein, MUL_3720, as a promising target for antigen capture-based detection assays. We show that MUL_3720 is highly expressed by M. ulcerans and has no orthologs in other prevalent pathogenic mycobacteria. We generated a panel of anti-MUL_3720 antibodies and used them to confirm a cell wall location for MUL_3720. These antibodies could also specifically detect M. ulcerans in infected human tissue samples as well as in lysates of infected mouse footpads. A bacterial 2-hybrid screen suggested a potential role for MUL_3720 in cell wall biosynthesis pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that a combination of MUL_3720 specific antibody reagents in a sandwich-ELISA format has sufficient sensitivity to make them suitable for the development of antigen capture-based diagnostic tests for BU.
","According to the recommendations of the World Health Organization, the clinical diagnosis of BU should be reconfirmed by at least two laboratory techniques. However, out of the four currently available tests, three (PCR, histopathology and cultivation of M. ulcerans) can only be performed at centralized reference laboratories; the fourth (microscopic detection of acid fast bacilli) lacks the required sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, a simple tool for early diagnosis of the disease, which can be implemented in rural health care facilities of the endemic countries, is of urgent need. In this study we aimed at the identification of M. ulcerans proteins as potential targets for the development of a simple and rapid diagnostic antigen detection assay. Among 36 proteins, MUL_3720 best met the predefined criteria of being highly expressed by M. ulcerans and not having orthologs in other pathogenic mycobacterial species prevalent in the endemic regions. Here we generated monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against this protein and carried out pilot studies for the development of an antigen capture-based diagnostic test.

"Cholera prevention and control interventions targeted to neighbors of cholera cases (case-area targeted interventions [CATIs]), including improved water, sanitation, and hygiene, oral cholera vaccine (OCV), and prophylactic antibiotics, may be able to efficiently avert cholera cases and deaths while saving scarce resources during epidemics. Efforts to quickly target interventions to neighbors of cases have been made in recent outbreaks, but little empirical evidence related to the effectiveness, efficiency, or ideal design of this approach exists. Here, we aim to provide practical guidance on how CATIs might be used by exploring key determinants of intervention impact, including the mix of interventions, “ring” size, and timing, in simulated cholera epidemics fit to data from an urban cholera epidemic in Africa.
We developed a micro-simulation model and calibrated it to both the epidemic curve and the small-scale spatiotemporal clustering pattern of case households from a large 2011 cholera outbreak in N’Djamena, Chad (4,352 reported cases over 232 days), and explored the potential impact of CATIs in simulated epidemics. CATIs were implemented with realistic logistical delays after cases presented for care using different combinations of prophylactic antibiotics, OCV, and/or point-of-use water treatment (POUWT) starting at different points during the epidemics and targeting rings of various radii around incident case households. Our findings suggest that CATIs shorten the duration of epidemics and are more resource-efficient than mass campaigns. OCV was predicted to be the most effective single intervention, followed by POUWT and antibiotics. CATIs with OCV started early in an epidemic focusing on a 100-m radius around case households were estimated to shorten epidemics by 68% (IQR 62% to 72%), with an 81% (IQR 69% to 87%) reduction in cases compared to uncontrolled epidemics. These same targeted interventions with OCV led to a 44-fold (IQR 27 to 78) reduction in the number of people needed to target to avert a single case of cholera, compared to mass campaigns in high-cholera-risk neighborhoods. The optimal radius to target around incident case households differed by intervention type, with antibiotics having an optimal radius of 30 m to 45 m compared to 70 m to 100 m for OCV and POUWT. Adding POUWT or antibiotics to OCV provided only marginal impact and efficiency improvements. Starting CATIs early in an epidemic with OCV and POUWT targeting those within 100 m of an incident case household reduced epidemic durations by 70% (IQR 65% to 75%) and the number of cases by 82% (IQR 71% to 88%) compared to uncontrolled epidemics. CATIs used late in epidemics, even after the peak, were estimated to avert relatively few cases but substantially reduced the number of epidemic days (e.g., by 28% [IQR 15% to 45%] for OCV in a 100-m radius). While this study is based on a rigorous, data-driven approach, the relatively high uncertainty about the ways in which POUWT and antibiotic interventions reduce cholera risk, as well as the heterogeneity in outbreak dynamics from place to place, limits the precision and generalizability of our quantitative estimates.
In this study, we found that CATIs using OCV, antibiotics, and water treatment interventions at an appropriate radius around cases could be an effective and efficient way to fight cholera epidemics. They can provide a complementary and efficient approach to mass intervention campaigns and may prove particularly useful during the initial phase of an outbreak, when there are few cases and few available resources, or in order to shorten the often protracted tails of cholera epidemics.
","The risk of cholera around households of cholera cases is higher than in the general population in the days after cholera symptoms start.
Rapid targeting of cholera interventions to neighbors of cholera cases may provide an effective and resource-efficient way to avert cholera cases and deaths and reduce the duration of epidemics.
Interventions targeted to neighbors of cases using combinations of antibiotics, oral cholera vaccine, and/or water, sanitation, and hygiene measures have been used in Africa and the Americas to fight cholera, yet limited evidence exists on the potential impact of this approach, the optimal mix of interventions, and the extent of the target population.
Using computational models, we simulated cholera epidemics similar to a large urban cholera outbreak in Chad and evaluated the potential impact of targeted interventions administered to people living within a fixed radius (e.g., 100 m) around reported cholera cases.
Targeted interventions with oral cholera vaccine were predicted to have the largest impact on reducing cases and shortening epidemics, followed by water treatment interventions and by prophylactic antibiotics, regardless of when interventions started during epidemics.
The combined use of oral cholera vaccine and water treatment within 100 m around cases starting early in epidemics were estimated to lead to 70% (interquartile range [IQR] 65% to 75%) fewer epidemic days and 82% (IQR 71% to 88%) fewer cases than uncontrolled epidemics.
Compared to traditional mass intervention campaigns, targeted interventions can have a similar or larger impact on epidemics and use less resources.
The optimal radius to target around incident case households differed by intervention type, with antibiotics having an optimal radius of 30 m to 45 m compared to 70 m to 100 m for oral cholera vaccine and point-of-use water treatment.
Interventions targeted to neighbors of cholera cases can be an effective and resource-efficient strategy to fight cholera epidemics; they may be particularly useful during the early phase of an outbreak, when the number of cases is still low, and to truncate the tails of outbreaks, after a mass intervention campaign.
While field studies and/or clinical trials are needed to measure the effectiveness of targeted interventions, these results provide a rationale to focus efforts on interventions with oral cholera vaccine and water treatment interventions in a roughly 100-m radius around case households.

"Although Mycobacterium leprae (M.leprae) is usually found in macrophages and nerves of the dermis of patients with multibacillary leprosy, it is also present in all layers of the epidermis, basal, suprabasal, prickle cells, and keratin layers. However, the mechanism by which M.leprae invades the dermis remains unknown, whereas the underlying mechanism by which M.leprae invades peripheral nerves, especially Schwann cells, is well defined. M. leprae binds to the α-dystroglycan (DG) of Schwann cells via the interaction of α-DG and laminin (LN) -α2 in the basal lamina, thus permitting it to become attached to and invade peripheral nerves. In the current study, we investigated the issue of how M.leprae is phagocytosed by human epidermal keratinocytes, neonatal (HEKn). LN-5 is the predominant form of laminin in the epidermis and allows the epidermis to be stably attached to the dermis via its interaction with α/β-DG as well as integrins that are produced by keratinocytes. We therefore focused on the role of LN-5 when M. leprae is internalized by HEKn cells. Our results show that M.leprae preferentially binds to LN-5-coated slides and this binding to LN-5 enhances its binding to HEKn cells. The findings also show that pre-treatment with an antibody against α-DG, integrin-β1, or -β4 inhibited the binding of LN-5-coated M.leprae to HEKn cells. These results suggest that M. leprae binds to keratinocytes by taking advantage of the interaction of LN-5 in the basal lamina of the epidermis and a surface receptor of keratinocytes, such as α-DG, integrin-β1, or -β4.

"In Drosophila, post-transcriptional gene silencing occurs when exogenous or endogenous double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) in association with a dsRNA-binding protein (dsRBP) cofactor called Loquacious (Loqs-PD). siRNAs are then loaded onto Argonaute-2 (Ago2) by the action of Dcr-2 with another dsRBP cofactor called R2D2. Loaded Ago2 executes the destruction of target RNAs that have sequence complementarity to siRNAs. Although Dcr-2, R2D2, and Ago2 are essential for innate antiviral defense, the mechanism of virus-derived siRNA (vsiRNA) biogenesis and viral target inhibition remains unclear. Here, we characterize the response mechanism mediated by siRNAs against two different RNA viruses that infect Drosophila. In both cases, we show that vsiRNAs are generated by Dcr-2 processing of dsRNA formed during viral genome replication and, to a lesser extent, viral transcription. These vsiRNAs seem to preferentially target viral polyadenylated RNA to inhibit viral replication. Loqs-PD is completely dispensable for silencing of the viruses, in contrast to its role in silencing endogenous targets. Biogenesis of vsiRNAs is independent of both Loqs-PD and R2D2. R2D2, however, is required for sorting and loading of vsiRNAs onto Ago2 and inhibition of viral RNA expression. Direct injection of viral RNA into Drosophila results in replication that is also independent of Loqs-PD. This suggests that triggering of the antiviral pathway is not related to viral mode of entry but recognition of intrinsic features of virus RNA. Our results indicate the existence of a vsiRNA pathway that is separate from the endogenous siRNA pathway and is specifically triggered by virus RNA. We speculate that this unique framework might be necessary for a prompt and efficient antiviral response.
","The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway utilizes small non-coding RNAs to silence gene expression. In insects, RNAi regulates endogenous genes and functions as an RNA-based immune system against viral infection. Here we have uncovered details of how RNAi is triggered by RNA viruses. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) generated as a replication intermediate or from transcription of the RNA virus can be used as substrate for the biogenesis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). Unlike other dsRNAs, virus RNA processing involves Dicer but not its canonical partner protein Loqs-PD. Thus, vsiRNA biogenesis is mechanistically different from biogenesis of endogenous siRNAs or siRNAs derived from other exogenous RNA sources. Our results suggest a specialization of the pathway dedicated to silencing of RNA viruses versus other types of RNAi silencing. The understanding of RNAi mechanisms during viral infection could have implications for the control of insect-borne viruses and the use of siRNAs to treat viral infections in humans.

"The DREAM (Dp/Retinoblastoma(Rb)-like/E2F/MuvB) transcriptional repressor complex acts as a gatekeeper of the mammalian cell cycle by establishing and maintaining cellular quiescence. How DREAM’s three functional components, the E2F-DP heterodimer, the Rb-like pocket protein, and the MuvB subcomplex, form and function at target gene promoters remains unknown. The current model invokes that the pocket protein links E2F-DP and MuvB and is essential for gene repression. We tested this model by assessing how the conserved yet less redundant DREAM system in Caenorhabditis elegans is affected by absence of the sole C. elegans pocket protein LIN-35. Using a LIN-35 protein null mutant, we analyzed the assembly of E2F-DP and MuvB at promoters that are bound by DREAM and the level of expression of those ""DREAM target genes"" in embryos. We report that LIN-35 indeed mediates the association of E2F-DP and MuvB, a function that stabilizes DREAM subunit occupancy at target genes. In the absence of LIN-35, the occupancy of E2F-DP and MuvB at most DREAM target genes decreases dramatically and many of those genes become upregulated. The retention of E2F-DP and MuvB at some target gene promoters in lin-35 null embryos allowed us to test their contribution to DREAM target gene repression. Depletion of MuvB, but not E2F-DP, in the sensitized lin-35 null background caused further upregulation of DREAM target genes. We conclude that the pocket protein functions primarily to support MuvB-mediated repression of DREAM targets and that transcriptional repression is the innate function of the evolutionarily conserved MuvB complex. Our findings provide important insights into how mammalian DREAM assembly and disassembly may regulate gene expression and the cell cycle.
","The 8-subunit DREAM transcriptional repressor complex contains 3 functional components that together control expression of cell cycle and developmental genes. How the E2F-DP transcription factor heterodimer, the pocket protein, and the highly conserved MuvB complex coalesce on chromatin and repress DREAM target genes has yet to be determined. We directly tested the prevailing model that the DREAM pocket protein links E2F-DP to MuvB and is required for gene repression. Using a protein null mutant of the sole C. elegans pocket protein LIN-35, we demonstrate that the pocket protein indeed links E2F-DP and MuvB, which aids in the stable occupancy of DREAM components near target genes. Depletion of additional DREAM components in lin-35 null worms revealed that the remaining chromatin-bound MuvB represses target genes. We conclude that the MuvB subcomplex mediates DREAM’s critical repressive function. Our functional genomics approach in the simplified C. elegans system reveals that the ancestral function of the pocket protein is to stabilize the innate repressive activity of MuvB, ensuring proper regulation of DREAM target genes through development.

"In a previous study PCR analysis of clinical samples from suspected cases of Buruli ulcer disease (BUD) from Togo and external quality assurance (EQA) for local microscopy were conducted at an external reference laboratory in Germany. The relatively poor performance of local microscopy as well as effort and time associated with shipment of PCR samples necessitated the implementation of stringent EQA measures and availability of local laboratory capacity. This study describes the approach to implementation of a national BUD reference laboratory in Togo.
Large scale outreach activities accompanied by regular training programs for health care professionals were conducted in the regions “Maritime” and “Central,” standard operating procedures defined all processes in participating laboratories (regional, national and external reference laboratories) as well as the interaction between laboratories and partners in the field. Microscopy was conducted at regional level and slides were subjected to EQA at national and external reference laboratories. For PCR analysis, sample pairs were collected and subjected to a dry-reagent-based IS2404-PCR (DRB-PCR) at national level and standard IS2404 PCR followed by IS2404 qPCR analysis of negative samples at the external reference laboratory.
The inter-laboratory concordance rates for microscopy ranged from 89% to 94%; overall, microscopy confirmed 50% of all suspected BUD cases. The inter-laboratory concordance rate for PCR was 96% with an overall PCR case confirmation rate of 78%. Compared to a previous study, the rate of BUD patients with non-ulcerative lesions increased from 37% to 50%, the mean duration of disease before clinical diagnosis decreased significantly from 182.6 to 82.1 days among patients with ulcerative lesions, and the percentage of category III lesions decreased from 30.3% to 19.2%.
High inter-laboratory concordance rates as well as case confirmation rates of 50% (microscopy), 71% (PCR at national level), and 78% (including qPCR confirmation at external reference laboratory) suggest high standards of BUD diagnostics. The increase of non-ulcerative lesions, as well as the decrease in diagnostic delay and category III lesions, prove the effect of comprehensive EQA and training measures involving also procedures outside the laboratory.
","Buruli ulcer disease (BUD), the third most common mycobacterial disease worldwide, is treated with standardized antimycobacterial therapy. According to WHO recommendations at least 50% of cases should be laboratory confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a previous study PCR analysis of clinical samples from suspected BUD cases from Togo and external quality assurance (EQA) for local microscopy were conducted at an external reference laboratory in Germany. The relatively poor performance of local microscopy as well as time and effort associated with shipment of clinical samples abroad necessitated the availability of a local BUD reference laboratory and the implementation of stringent EQA measures. All processes in the laboratories as well as in the field were defined by standard operating procedures, microscopy conducted at regional facilities was subjected to EQA at national and external reference level, and PCR samples were analyzed in parallel at national and external reference laboratories. Inter-laboratory concordance rates of >90% and case confirmation rates of 50% (microscopy) and >70% (PCR) respectively suggest high standards of BUD diagnostics. Furthermore, an increase of non-ulcerative lesions and a decrease in diagnostic delay and category III lesions reflect the impact of comprehensive EQA measures also involving procedures outside the laboratory on the quality of BUD control.

"Singapore experiences endemic dengue, with 2013 being the largest outbreak year known to date, culminating in 22,170 cases. Given the limited resources available, and that vector control is the key approach for prevention in Singapore, it is important that public health professionals know where resources should be invested in. This study aims to stratify the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore for effective deployment of resources.
Random Forest was used to predict the risk rank of dengue transmission in 1km2 grids, with dengue, population, entomological and environmental data. The predicted risk ranks are categorized and mapped to four color-coded risk groups for easy operation application. The risk maps were evaluated with dengue case and cluster data. Risk maps produced by Random Forest have high accuracy. More than 80% of the observed risk ranks fell within the 80% prediction interval. The observed and predicted risk ranks were highly correlated (ρ ≥0.86, P <0.01). Furthermore, the predicted risk levels were in excellent agreement with case density, a weighted Kappa coefficient of more than 0.80 (P <0.01). Close to 90% of the dengue clusters occur in high risk areas, and the odds of cluster forming in high risk areas were higher than in low risk areas.
This study demonstrates the potential of Random Forest and its strong predictive capability in stratifying the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore. Dengue risk map produced using Random Forest has high accuracy, and is a good surveillance tool to guide vector control operations.
","Dengue fever, the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease today, is caused by Dengue virus (DENV) and transmitted to human by Aedes mosquitoes, primarily the Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The key approach to mitigating dengue transmission is to control the Aedes population, and this often involve vector control strategies such as larval source reduction and preventive surveillance that are labour-intensive and require effective deployment of valuable resources. Spatial risk profiling of dengue transmission is therefore necessary to ensure the optimal utilization of limited resources, and achieving maximum impact of dengue vector control. Here, we developed a dengue risk map by stratifying the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore. Random Forest was used to predict the risk rank of dengue transmission in 1km2 grids, and the predicted risk ranks are then categorized and mapped to color-coded risk groups. The dengue risk map is a good surveillance tool to guide vector control operations. Valuable resources can be deployed in a strategic manner, mitigating the spread of dengue transmission.

"The burden of malaria in Vietnam has drastically reduced, prompting the National Malaria Control Program to officially engage in elimination efforts. Plasmodium vivax is becoming increasingly prevalent, remaining a major problem in the country's central and southern provinces. A better understanding of P. vivax genetic diversity and structure of local parasite populations will provide baseline data for the evaluation and improvement of current efforts for control and elimination. The aim of this study was to examine the population genetics and structure of P. vivax isolates from four communities in Tra Leng commune, Nam Tra My district in Quang Nam, Central Vietnam.
P. vivax mono infections collected from 234 individuals between April 2009 and December 2010 were successfully analyzed using a panel of 14 microsatellite markers. Isolates displayed moderate genetic diversity (He = 0.68), with no significant differences between study communities. Polyclonal infections were frequent (71.4%) with a mean multiplicity of infection of 1.91 isolates/person. Low but significant genetic differentiation (FST value from -0.05 to 0.18) was observed between the community across the river and the other communities. Strong linkage disequilibrium (IAS = 0.113, p < 0.001) was detected across all communities, suggesting gene flow within and among them. Using multiple approaches, 101 haplotypes were grouped into two genetic clusters, while 60.4% of haplotypes were admixed.
In this area of Central Vietnam, where malaria transmission has decreased significantly over the past decade, there was moderate genetic diversity and high occurrence of polyclonal infections. Local human populations have frequent social and economic interactions that facilitate gene flow and inbreeding among parasite populations, while decreasing population structure. Findings provide important information on parasites populations circulating in the study area and are relevant to current malaria elimination efforts.
","In Vietnam, Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is the second most frequent human malaria parasite and a major obstacle to countrywide malaria elimination. Knowing the local parasite structure is useful for elimination efforts. Therefore, we analyzed, with a panel of 14 microsatellite markers, 234 P. vivax mono infections in blood samples collected from 4 communities in central Vietnam. Genetic diversity in the population was moderate; a high occurrence of polyclonal infections and significant linkage disequilibrium were detected, suggesting inbreeding or recombination between highly related haplotypes. In addition, both genetic differentiation and population structure was low and only detected between communities at each side of the river. Those results suggest gene flow between study communities with the river defining a moderate geographical barrier. Future studies should determine how this genetic variation is maintained in an area of extremely low transmission.

"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a crucial regulator of a wide array of cellular processes, such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, but its role in Leishmania donovani infection is unknown.
In the present study, we observed that L. donovani infection in THP-1 derived macrophages (TDM) leads to decrease in the expression of S1pr2 and S1pr3 at mRNA level. We further observed that Leishmania infection inhibits the phosphorylation of sphingosine kinase 1 (sphK1) in a time-dependent manner. Exogenous S1P supplementation decreases L. donovani induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and increases p38 phosphorylation in TDM, resulting in a decrease in the intracellular parasite burden in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, sphK inhibition by DMS increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation leading to increased IL-10 and parasite load. To gain further insight, cytokines expression were checked in S1P supplemented TDM and we observed increase in IL-12, while decrease IL-10 expression at mRNA and protein levels. In addition, treatment of antagonist of S1PR2 and S1PR3 such as JTE-013 and CAY10444 respectively enhanced Leishmania-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and parasite load.
Our overall study not only reports the significant role of S1P signaling during L. donovani infection but also provides a novel platform for the development of new drugs against Leishmaniasis.
","Leishmania donovani is an intracellular parasite which is internalized by host macrophages by subverting several intracellular signaling events. During infection suppression of p38 MAPK and activation of ERK1/2 MAPK have been acclaimed for survival and proliferation of these protozoan parasites. In this study, we show novel signaling pathways that interact with these MAPK that further contributes to determine the final fate of the disease. Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that binds to a family of G-protein coupled receptors known as S1P receptors. TDM infected with Leishmania donovani showed a decrease in the expression of S1PR1-3. Moreover, the enzyme that catalyzes S1P production, Sphingosine Kinase 1, showed decreased activation in a time-dependent fashion in infected cells. Furthermore, exogenously supplementation of S1P clears intracellular parasite burden by a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and IL-10 at mRNA and protein level. On the other hand, S1P induces anti-leishmanial response by activating p38 phosphorylation and IL-12 at mRNA as well as at protein level. To further gain insight on the receptors subtypes involved in the anti-leishmanial response, we specifically blocked S1PR2 and S1PR3. In this study, we found a tremendous increase in the parasite load as a result of increased IL-10 secretion and ERK1/2 phosphorylation on combination of these inhibitor doses. Taking together, our study thus suggested the possible involvement of S1PR2-3 during Leishmania donovani infection in human macrophages. These findings thus elaborate our knowledge in understanding the interaction of signaling intermediates during Leishmania infection which may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic interventions.

"Cell competition is a phenomenon originally described as the competition between cell populations with different genetic backgrounds; losing cells with lower fitness are eliminated. With the progress in identification of related molecules, some reports described the relevance of cell mechanics during elimination. Furthermore, recent live imaging studies have shown that even in tissues composed of genetically identical cells, a non-negligible number of cells are eliminated during growth. Thus, mechanical cell elimination (MCE) as a consequence of mechanical cellular interactions is an unavoidable event in growing tissues and a commonly observed phenomenon. Here, we studied MCE in a genetically-homogeneous tissue from the perspective of tissue growth efficiency and homeostasis. First, we propose two quantitative measures, cell and tissue fitness, to evaluate cellular competitiveness and tissue growth efficiency, respectively. By mechanical tissue simulation in a pure population where all cells have the same mechanical traits, we clarified the dependence of cell elimination rate or cell fitness on different mechanical/growth parameters. In particular, we found that geometrical (specifically, cell size) and mechanical (stress magnitude) heterogeneities are common determinants of the elimination rate. Based on these results, we propose possible mechanical feedback mechanisms that could improve tissue growth efficiency and density/stress homeostasis. Moreover, when cells with different mechanical traits are mixed (e.g., in the presence of phenotypic variation), we show that MCE could drive a drastic shift in cell trait distribution, thereby improving tissue growth efficiency through the selection of cellular traits, i.e. intra-tissue “evolution”. Along with the improvement of growth efficiency, cell density, stress state, and phenotype (mechanical traits) were also shown to be homogenized through growth. More theoretically, we propose a mathematical model that approximates cell competition dynamics, by which the time evolution of tissue fitness and cellular trait distribution can be predicted without directly simulating a cell-based mechanical model.
","When genetically different cell populations are mixed, there is competition between cells such that losing cells are eliminated from a tissue. Such cell elimination is also observed during normal development in genetically-homogeneous tissues. In addition to the identification of key genes and molecular mechanisms related to these phenomena, the relevance of cell/tissue mechanics has been reported as a possible common mechanism of elimination. Here, we examined these mechanisms and possible functions of mechanical cell elimination (MCE) from the perspective of tissue growth efficiency and homeostasis. Using mechanical simulations of tissue growth processes, we identified key parameters of cellular mechanical/growth properties that determine elimination rates or cellular fitness (defined as the difference between cell division and elimination rate). Based on these results, we propose mechanical feedback mechanisms that could improve tissue growth efficiency and density/stress homeostasis. Furthermore, when cells with different mechanical traits are mixed, we found that MCE could drive a drastic shift in cell trait distribution, thereby improving tissue growth efficiency through the selection of cellular traits. With this, cell density, stress state, and phenotype were also shown to become homogenous. Our results will permit the elucidation of the mechanisms of intrinsic tissue defense against abnormal cells by their elimination through mechanical cell-cell interactions.

"Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gammaherpesvirus etiologically associated with KS, a highly disseminated angiogenic tumor of hyperproliferative spindle endothelial cells. KSHV encodes 25 mature microRNAs but their roles in KSHV-induced tumor dissemination and angiogenesis remain unknown. Here, we investigated KSHV-encoded miR-K12-6-3p (miR-K6-3p) promotion of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, which are the underlying mechanisms of tumor dissemination and angiogenesis. We found that ectopic expression of miR-K6-3p promoted endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Mass spectrometry, bioinformatics and luciferase reporter analyses revealed that miR-K6-3p directly targeted sequence in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of SH3 domain binding glutamate-rich protein (SH3BGR). Overexpression of SH3BGR reversed miR-K6-3p induction of cell migration and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, miR-K6-3p downregulated SH3BGR, hence relieved STAT3 from SH3BGR direct binding and inhibition, which was required for miR-K6-3p maximum activation of STAT3 and induction of cell migration and angiogenesis. Finally, deletion of miR-K6 from the KSHV genome abrogated its effect on the SH3BGR/STAT3 pathway, and KSHV-induced migration and angiogenesis. Our results illustrated that, by inhibiting SH3BGR, miR-K6-3p enhances cell migration and angiogenesis by activating the STAT3 pathway, and thus contributes to the dissemination and angiogenesis of KSHV-induced malignancies.
","Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS), caused by infection of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is a tumor of endothelial cells characterized by angiogenesis and invasiveness. In vitro, KSHV-infected endothelial cells display an increased invasiveness and angiogenicity. KSHV encodes twelve precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), which are processed into at least 25 mature miRNAs. However, the roles of these miRNAs in KSHV-induced tumor dissemination and angiogenesis remain unknown. Here, we investigated KSHV-encoded miR-K12-6-3p (miR-K6-3p) promotion of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, which are the underlying mechanisms of tumor dissemination and angiogenesis. We demonstrated that miR-K6-3p promoted cell migration and angiogenesis by directly targeting SH3 domain binding glutamate-rich protein (SH3BGR). Furthermore, we found that STAT3, which was negatively regulated by SH3BGR mediated miR-K6-3p-induced cell migration and angiogenesis. MiR-K6-3p downregulation of SH3BGR, hence relieved SH3BGR direct inhibition of STAT3 resulting in the activation of STAT3 and induction of cell migration and angiogenesis. These results identify miR-K6-3p and its the downstream pathway as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of KSHV-associated malignancies.

"From computational simulations of a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) model complexed with pharmacologically and structurally diverse ligands we identify different conformational states and dynamics adopted by the receptor bound to the full agonist 5-HT, the partial agonist LSD, and the inverse agonist Ketanserin. The results from the unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the three ligands affect differently the known GPCR activation elements including the toggle switch at W6.48, the changes in the ionic lock between E6.30 and R3.50 of the DRY motif in TM3, and the dynamics of the NPxxY motif in TM7. The computational results uncover a sequence of steps connecting these experimentally-identified elements of GPCR activation. The differences among the properties of the receptor molecule interacting with the ligands correlate with their distinct pharmacological properties. Combining these results with quantitative analysis of membrane deformation obtained with our new method (Mondal et al, Biophysical Journal 2011), we show that distinct conformational rearrangements produced by the three ligands also elicit different responses in the surrounding membrane. The differential reorganization of the receptor environment is reflected in (i)-the involvement of cholesterol in the activation of the 5-HT2AR, and (ii)-different extents and patterns of membrane deformations. These findings are discussed in the context of their likely functional consequences and a predicted mechanism of ligand-specific GPCR oligomerization.
","The 5-HT2A receptor for the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) belongs to family A (rhodopsin-like) G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), one of the most important classes of membrane proteins that are targeted by an extensive and diverse collection of external stimuli. Recently we learned that different ligands targeting the same GPCR can elicit different biological responses, but the mechanisms remain unknown. We address this fundamental question for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, because it is known to respond to the binding of structurally diverse ligands by producing similar stimuli in the cell, and to the binding of quite similar ligands with dramatically different responses. Molecular dynamics simulations of molecular models of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in complex with pharmacologically distinct ligands show the dynamic rearrangements of the receptor molecule to be different for these ligands, and the nature and extents of the rearrangements reflect the known pharmacological properties of the ligands as full, partial or inverse activators of the receptor. The different rearrangements of the receptor molecule are shown to produce different rearrangements of the surrounding membrane, a remodeling of the environment that can have differential ligand-determined effects on receptor function and association in the cell's membrane.

"Dengue (DEN) represents the most serious arthropod-borne viral disease. DEN clinical manifestations range from mild febrile illness to life-threatening hemorrhage and vascular leakage. Early epidemiological observations reported that infants born to DEN-immune mothers were at greater risk to develop the severe forms of the disease upon infection with any serotype of dengue virus (DENV). From these observations emerged the hypothesis of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease severity, whereby maternally acquired anti-DENV antibodies cross-react but fail to neutralize DENV particles, resulting in higher viremia that correlates with increased disease severity. Although in vitro and in vivo experimental set ups have indirectly supported the ADE hypothesis, direct experimental evidence has been missing. Furthermore, a recent epidemiological study has challenged the influence of maternal antibodies in disease outcome. Here we have developed a mouse model of ADE where DENV2 infection of young mice born to DENV1-immune mothers led to earlier death which correlated with higher viremia and increased vascular leakage compared to DENV2-infected mice born to dengue naïve mothers. In this ADE model we demonstrated the role of TNF-α in DEN-induced vascular leakage. Furthermore, upon infection with an attenuated DENV2 mutant strain, mice born to DENV1-immune mothers developed lethal disease accompanied by vascular leakage whereas infected mice born to dengue naïve mothers did no display any clinical manifestation. In vitro ELISA and ADE assays confirmed the cross-reactive and enhancing properties towards DENV2 of the serum from mice born to DENV1-immune mothers. Lastly, age-dependent susceptibility to disease enhancement was observed in mice born to DENV1-immune mothers, thus reproducing epidemiological observations.
Overall, this work provides direct in vivo demonstration of the role of maternally acquired heterotypic dengue antibodies in the enhancement of dengue disease severity and offers a unique opportunity to further decipher the mechanisms involved.
","Dengue (DEN) is an arthropod-transmitted viral disease which affects approximately 390 million individuals in the tropical and subtropical world annually. DEN clinical manifestations range from mild febrile illness (dengue fever) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Epidemiological observations indicate that infants born to dengue immune mothers are at greater risk to develop the severe form of the disease (DHF/DSS) upon infection with any serotype of dengue virus (DENV). It was proposed that the presence of maternally acquired DENV specific antibodies cross react but fail to neutralize DENV particles, resulting in higher viremia that correlates with increased disease severity. Direct experimental evidence supporting this antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) hypothesis has been missing. Furthermore, a recent epidemiological report has challenged the influence of maternally acquired antibodies in disease outcome. Here, we have developed a mouse model of ADE where DENV2-infected mice born to DENV1 immune mothers displayed enhanced disease severity compared to DENV2-infected mice born to dengue naïve mothers. This is a long-overdue direct experimental evidence of the role of maternally acquired antibodies in dengue disease outcome. It provides a unique opportunity to dissect the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon.

"In multicellular organisms, development, growth and reproduction require coordinated expression of numerous functional and regulatory genes. Insects, in addition to being the most speciose animal group with enormous biological and economical significance, represent outstanding model organisms for studying regulation of synchronized gene expression due to their rapid development and reproduction. Disease-transmitting female mosquitoes have adapted uniquely for ingestion and utilization of the huge blood meal required for swift reproductive events to complete egg development within a 72-h period. We investigated the network of regulatory factors mediating sequential gene expression in the fat body, a multifunctional organ analogous to the vertebrate liver and adipose tissue, of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses revealed that ~7500 transcripts are differentially expressed in four sequential waves during the 72-h reproductive period. A combination of RNA-interference gene-silencing and in-vitro organ culture identified the major regulators for each of these waves. Amino acids (AAs) regulate the first wave of gene activation between 3 h and 12 h post-blood meal (PBM). During the second wave, between 12 h and 36 h, most genes are highly upregulated by a synergistic action of AAs, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and the Ecdysone-Receptor (EcR). Between 36 h and 48 h, the third wave of gene activation—regulated mainly by HR3—occurs. Juvenile Hormone (JH) and its receptor Methoprene-Tolerant (Met) are major regulators for the final wave between 48 h and 72 h. Each of these key regulators also has repressive effects on one or more gene sets. Our study provides a better understanding of the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms related to temporal coordination of gene expression during reproduction. We have detected the novel function of 20E/EcR responsible for transcriptional repression. This study also reveals the previously unidentified large-scale effects of HR3 and JH/Met on transcriptional regulation during the termination of vitellogenesis and remodeling of the fat body.
","In addition to being vectors of devastating human diseases, mosquitoes represent outstanding model organisms for studying regulatory mechanisms of differential gene expression due to their rapid reproductive cycles. About 7500 transcripts are differentially expressed in four sequential waves during the 72-h reproductive period in the fat body, a critical reproductive organ. The major regulators for these waves of gene expression are the two very important insect hormones, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and Juvenile hormone (JH), their respective receptors Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Methoprene-Tolerant (Met), amino acids and the orphan nuclear receptor HR3. These key regulators are responsible for activation and repression of co-regulated gene sets, at different time points, within the 72-h reproductive period. Importantly, this study, apart from providing an insight into the regulatory complexity involved in the temporal coordination of gene expression, also reveals the previously unidentified roles of 20E/EcR, JH/Met and HR3 during the 72-h period post blood meal.

"Chromosome organizations of related bacterial genera are well conserved despite a very long divergence period. We have assessed the forces limiting bacterial genome plasticity in Escherichia coli by measuring the respective effect of altering different parameters, including DNA replication, compositional skew of replichores, coordination of gene expression with DNA replication, replication-associated gene dosage, and chromosome organization into macrodomains. Chromosomes were rearranged by large inversions. Changes in the compositional skew of replichores, in the coordination of gene expression with DNA replication or in the replication-associated gene dosage have only a moderate effect on cell physiology because large rearrangements inverting the orientation of several hundred genes inside a replichore are only slightly detrimental. By contrast, changing the balance between the two replication arms has a more drastic effect, and the recombinational rescue of replication forks is required for cell viability when one of the chromosome arms is less than half than the other one. Macrodomain organization also appears to be a major factor restricting chromosome plasticity, and two types of inverted configurations severely affect the cell cycle. First, the disruption of the Ter macrodomain with replication forks merging far from the normal replichore junction provoked chromosome segregation defects. The second major problematic configurations resulted from inversions between Ori and Right macrodomains, which perturb nucleoid distribution and early steps of cytokinesis. Consequences for the control of the bacterial cell cycle and for the evolution of bacterial chromosome configuration are discussed.
","Genomic analyses have revealed that bacterial genomes are dynamic entities that evolve through various processes including intrachromosome genetic rearrangements, gene duplication, and gene loss or acquisition by gene transfer. Nevertheless, comparison of bacterial chromosomes from related genera revealed a conservation of genetic organization. Most bacterial genomes are circular molecules, and DNA replication proceeds bidirectionally from a single origin to an opposite region where replication forks meet. The replication process imprints the bacterial chromosome because initiation and termination at defined loci result in strand biases due to the mutational differences occurring during leading and lagging strands synthesis. We analyze the strength of different parameters that may limit genome plasticity. We show that the preferential positioning of essential genes on the leading strand, the proximity of genes involved in transcription and translation to the origin of replication on the leading strand, and the presence of biased motifs along the replichores operate only as long-term positive selection determinants. By contrast, selection operates to maintain replication arms of similar lengths. Finally, we demonstrate that spatial structuring of the chromosome impedes strongly genome plasticity. Genetic evidence supports the presence of two steps in the cell cycle controlled by the spatial organization of the chromosome.

"We present a rigorous statistical model that infers the structure of P. falciparum mixtures—including the number of strains present, their proportion within the samples, and the amount of unexplained mixture—using whole genome sequence (WGS) data. Applied to simulation data, artificial laboratory mixtures, and field samples, the model provides reasonable inference with as few as 10 reads or 50 SNPs and works efficiently even with much larger data sets. Source code and example data for the model are provided in an open source fashion. We discuss the possible uses of this model as a window into within-host selection for clinical and epidemiological studies.
","Since the 1960’s researchers have observed that Plasmodium falciparum infections, the cause of most severe malaria, are frequently composed of several different strains of the parasite. In this work, the authors use Bayesian methods on whole genome sequence data to model the structure of these mixtures. Results from this method are consistent with previous approaches but provide finer resolution of these mixtures. As whole genome data in malaria research becomes increasingly common, this work will allow researchers to delve further into the within-host dynamics of the parasite, a much-discussed but previously difficult-to-access aspect of this disease.

"Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan causative of Chagas disease, is classified into six main Discrete Typing Units (DTUs): TcI-TcVI. This parasite has around 105 copies of the minicircle hypervariable region (mHVR) in their kinetoplastic DNA (kDNA). The genetic diversity of the mHVR is virtually unknown. However, cross-hybridization assays using mHVRs showed hybridization only between isolates belonging to the same genetic group. Nowadays there is no methodologic approach with a good sensibility, specificity and reproducibility for direct typing on biological samples. Due to its high copy number and apparently high diversity, mHVR becomes a good target for typing.
Around 22 million reads, obtained by amplicon sequencing of the mHVR, were analyzed for nine strains belonging to six T. cruzi DTUs. The number and diversity of mHVR clusters was variable among DTUs and even within a DTU. However, strains of the same DTU shared more mHVR clusters than strains of different DTUs and clustered together. In addition, hybrid DTUs (TcV and TcVI) shared similar percentages (1.9–3.4%) of mHVR clusters with their parentals (TcII and TcIII). Conversely, just 0.2% of clusters were shared between TcII and TcIII suggesting biparental inheritance of the kDNA in hybrids. Sequencing at low depth (20,000–40,000 reads) also revealed 95% of the mHVR clusters for each of the analyzed strains. Finally, the method revealed good correlation in cluster identity and abundance between different replications of the experiment (r = 0.999).
Our work sheds light on the sequence diversity of mHVRs at intra and inter-DTU level. The mHVR amplicon sequencing workflow described here is a reproducible technique, that allows multiplexed analysis of hundreds of strains and results promissory for direct typing on biological samples in a future. In addition, such approach may help to gain knowledge on the mechanisms of the minicircle evolution and phylogenetic relationships among strains.
","Chagas disease is an important public health problem in Latin America showing a wide diversity of clinical manifestations and epidemiological patterns. It is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite is genetically diverse and classified into six main lineages. However, the relationship between intra-specific genetic diversity and clinical or epidemiological features is not clear, mainly because low sensitivity for direct typing on biological samples. For this reason, genetic markers with high copy number are required to achieve sensitivity. Here, we deep sequenced and analyzed a DNA region present in the large mitochondria of the parasite (named as mHVR, 105 copies per parasite) from strains belonging to the six main lineages in order to analyze mHVR diversity and to evaluate its usefulness for typing. Despite the high sequence diversity, strains of the same lineage shared more sequences than strains of different lineages. Curiously, hybrid lineages shared mHVR sequences with both parents suggesting that mHVR (and DNA minicircles from the mitochondria) are inherited from both parentals. The mHVR amplicon sequencing workflow proposed here is reproducible and, potentially, it would be useful for typing hundreds of biological samples at time. It also provides a valuable approach to perform evolutionary and functional studies.

"HIV-1 Vpu prevents incorporation of tetherin (BST2/ CD317) into budding virions and targets it for ESCRT-dependent endosomal degradation via a clathrin-dependent process. This requires a variant acidic dileucine-sorting motif (ExxxLV) in Vpu. Structural studies demonstrate that recombinant Vpu/tetherin fusions can form a ternary complex with the clathrin adaptor AP-1. However, open questions still exist about Vpu’s mechanism of action. Particularly, whether endosomal degradation and the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFβTRCP1/2 to a conserved phosphorylated binding site, DSGNES, are required for antagonism. Re-evaluation of the phenotype of Vpu phosphorylation mutants and naturally occurring allelic variants reveals that the requirement for the Vpu phosphoserine motif in tetherin antagonism is dissociable from SCFβTRCP1/2 and ESCRT-dependent tetherin degradation. Vpu phospho-mutants phenocopy ExxxLV mutants, and can be rescued by direct clathrin interaction in the absence of SCFβTRCP1/2 recruitment. Moreover, we demonstrate physical interaction between Vpu and AP-1 or AP-2 in cells. This requires Vpu/tetherin transmembrane domain interactions as well as the ExxxLV motif. Importantly, it also requires the Vpu phosphoserine motif and adjacent acidic residues. Taken together these data explain the discordance between the role of SCFβTRCP1/2 and Vpu phosphorylation in tetherin antagonism, and indicate that phosphorylation of Vpu in Vpu/tetherin complexes regulates promiscuous recruitment of adaptors, implicating clathrin-dependent sorting as an essential first step in tetherin antagonism.
","Counteraction of tetherin, a host antiviral protein that blocks viral release from infected cells, is an essential attribute of HIV-1 and its related viruses. The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu binds to tetherin, preventing its incorporation into viral particles, and targets it for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This involves mis-trafficking of tetherin by a Vpu-dependent mechanism through the engagement of clathrin adaptor proteins. Although structural evidence exists for Vpu and tetherin interacting with clathrin adaptor 1 (AP-1), evidence that it is required for Vpu-mediated tetherin counteraction is still lacking. Tetherin degradation by Vpu also requires an E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCFβTRCP1/2 that binds to phosphorylated serine residues in the Vpu cytoplasmic tail. Again, discrepancies exist about the importance of this interaction in tetherin’s counteraction. Here we show that Vpu phosphorylation, in combination with its physical interaction with tetherin, regulates interaction with both AP-1 and the other major cellular clathrin adaptor, AP-2. These interactions can be decoupled from SCFβTRCP1/2 recruitment, thus indicating clathrin-dependent mis-trafficking as a critical step in tetherin antagonism by Vpu. Additionally, the ability to interact both with AP-1 and AP-2 in a tetherin-dependent manner indicates a redundancy in host cofactors used by Vpu that explains disparate previous observations of its mechanism of action.

"The mitochondrial F-type ATP synthase, a multisubunit nanomotor, is critical for maintaining cellular ATP levels. In T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites, many subunit components necessary for proper assembly and functioning of this enzyme appear to be missing. Here, we report the identification of 20 novel subunits of T. gondii F-type ATP synthase from mass spectrometry analysis of partially purified monomeric (approximately 600 kDa) and dimeric (>1 MDa) forms of the enzyme. Despite extreme sequence diversification, key FO subunits a, b, and d can be identified from conserved structural features. Orthologs for these proteins are restricted to apicomplexan, chromerid, and dinoflagellate species. Interestingly, their absence in ciliates indicates a major diversion, with respect to subunit composition of this enzyme, within the alveolate clade. Discovery of these highly diversified novel components of the apicomplexan F-type ATP synthase complex could facilitate the development of novel antiparasitic agents. Structural and functional characterization of this unusual enzyme complex will advance our fundamental understanding of energy metabolism in apicomplexan species.
","The mitochondrial F-type ATP synthase, which is a major source of ATP in eukaryotic cells, is a unique nanomotor. The enzyme consists of two subcomplexes called the F1 and FO sectors. The F1 sector is the site of ATP synthesis, while the FO sector couples proton translocation to the rotary motion of the enzyme. FO sector subunits also form the peripheral stalk (stator), which holds the nonrotating parts of the enzyme together. F1 sector subunits are highly conserved among eukaryotes, while most FO sector subunits appear to be diverse and remain unknown in many species, including in the important human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. In this study, we have partially purified the T. gondii F-type ATP synthase and analyzed its proteome, using mass spectrometry. This resulted in the identification of 20 novel subunits of the enzyme, including extremely diversified key FO sector subunits. Many of these novel T. gondii proteins are conserved in related apicomplexan parasites, such as the malaria parasite, and thus might be good drug targets. Conservation of many of these proteins in related free-living alveolate species provides insights on their evolutionary history and can potentially facilitate further biochemical and structural studies on this unusual enzyme.

"Mutations of WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) lead to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), and down-regulation of WDR62 expression causes the loss of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). However, how WDR62 is regulated and hence controls neurogenesis and brain size remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) forms a complex with WDR62 to promote c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling synergistically in the control of neurogenesis. The deletion of Mekk3, Wdr62, or Jnk1 resulted in phenocopied defects, including premature NPC differentiation. We further showed that WDR62 protein is positively regulated by MEKK3 and JNK1 in the developing brain and that the defects of wdr62 deficiency can be rescued by the transgenic expression of JNK1. Meanwhile, WDR62 is also negatively regulated by T1053 phosphorylation, leading to the recruitment of F-box and WD repeat domain-containing protein 7 (FBW7) and proteasomal degradation. Our findings demonstrate that the coordinated reciprocal and bidirectional regulation among MEKK3, FBW7, WDR62, and JNK1, is required for fine-tuned JNK signaling for the control of balanced NPC self-renewal and differentiation during cortical development.
","Microcephaly is a neural developmental disorder characterized by significantly reduced brain size and variable intellectual disability. WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) was identified as the second most common gene for autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) in human. Here, we studied the underlying regulatory mechanism of WDR62 and the impact on generation of new neurons. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (Mekk3), Wdr62, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (Jnk1) knockout (KO) mice have defects in the generation and maturation of neurons. We demonstrate that WDR62 stability is positively regulated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), MEKK3, but negatively regulated by the E3 ligase, F-box and WD repeat domain-containing protein 7 (FBW7). These positive and negative factors calibrate the strength of the activity of the JNK signaling pathway, which controls self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during brain development. This finding improves our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MCPH.

"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are among the most common types of genetic variation in complex genetic disorders. A growing number of studies link the functional role of SNPs with the networks and pathways mediated by the disease-associated genes. For example, many non-synonymous missense SNPs (nsSNPs) have been found near or inside the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interfaces. Determining whether such nsSNP will disrupt or preserve a PPI is a challenging task to address, both experimentally and computationally. Here, we present this task as three related classification problems, and develop a new computational method, called the SNP-IN tool (non-synonymous SNP INteraction effect predictor). Our method predicts the effects of nsSNPs on PPIs, given the interaction's structure. It leverages supervised and semi-supervised feature-based classifiers, including our new Random Forest self-learning protocol. The classifiers are trained based on a dataset of comprehensive mutagenesis studies for 151 PPI complexes, with experimentally determined binding affinities of the mutant and wild-type interactions. Three classification problems were considered: (1) a 2-class problem (strengthening/weakening PPI mutations), (2) another 2-class problem (mutations that disrupt/preserve a PPI), and (3) a 3-class classification (detrimental/neutral/beneficial mutation effects). In total, 11 different supervised and semi-supervised classifiers were trained and assessed resulting in a promising performance, with the weighted f-measure ranging from 0.87 for Problem 1 to 0.70 for the most challenging Problem 3. By integrating prediction results of the 2-class classifiers into the 3-class classifier, we further improved its performance for Problem 3. To demonstrate the utility of SNP-IN tool, it was applied to study the nsSNP-induced rewiring of two disease-centered networks. The accurate and balanced performance of SNP-IN tool makes it readily available to study the rewiring of large-scale protein-protein interaction networks, and can be useful for functional annotation of disease-associated SNPs. SNIP-IN tool is freely accessible as a web-server at http://korkinlab.org/snpintool/.
","Many genetic diseases in humans and animals are caused by combinations of single-letter mutations, or SNPs. When these mutations occur in a protein-coding region of a genome, they can have a profound effect on the protein's function and ultimately on a health-related phenotype. Recently, a growing number of evidence suggests that many of SNPs reside on or near the protein regions that are required for the interactions with other proteins. Some of these SNPs could rewire the protein-protein interactions altering the functions of the protein interaction complexes, while other SNPs are neutral to the interactions. Understanding the effect of SNPs on the protein-protein interactions is a challenging problem to solve, both experimentally and computationally. Here, we leverage the machine learning methods by training a computational predictor to tell apart the mutations that are harmful to protein-protein interactions from those ones that are not. We use these tools in two case studies of mutations affecting the protein-protein interaction networks centered around the genes associated with breast cancer and diabetes.

"To date there are no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While a number of candidate drugs have shown limited efficacy in vitro and/or in non-human primate studies, differences in experimental methodologies make it difficult to compare their therapeutic effectiveness. Using an in vitro model of Ebola Zaire replication with transcription-competent virus like particles (trVLPs), requiring only level 2 biosafety containment, we compared the activities of the type I interferons (IFNs) IFN-α and IFN-ß, a panel of viral polymerase inhibitors (lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (AZT) tenofovir (TFV), favipiravir (FPV), the active metabolite of brincidofovir, cidofovir (CDF)), and the estrogen receptor modulator, toremifene (TOR), in inhibiting viral replication in dose-response and time course studies. We also tested 28 two- and 56 three-drug combinations against Ebola replication. IFN-α and IFN-ß inhibited viral replication 24 hours post-infection (IC50 0.038μM and 0.016μM, respectively). 3TC, AZT and TFV inhibited Ebola replication when used alone (50–62%) or in combination (87%). They exhibited lower IC50 (0.98–6.2μM) compared with FPV (36.8μM), when administered 24 hours post-infection. Unexpectedly, CDF had a narrow therapeutic window (6.25–25μM). When dosed >50μM, CDF treatment enhanced viral infection. IFN-ß exhibited strong synergy with 3TC (97.3% inhibition) or in triple combination with 3TC and AZT (95.8% inhibition). This study demonstrates that IFNs and viral polymerase inhibitors may have utility in EVD. We identified several 2 and 3 drug combinations with strong anti-Ebola activity, confirmed in studies using fully infectious ZEBOV, providing a rationale for testing combination therapies in animal models of lethal Ebola challenge. These studies open up new possibilities for novel therapeutic options, in particular combination therapies, which could prevent and treat Ebola infection and potentially reduce drug resistance.
","Studies to evaluate the effectiveness of candidate antiviral drugs to inhibit Ebola virus infection have been hampered by the availability and access to level 4 containment facilities. Using a mini-genome model system that generates Ebola virus-like particles that infect cells, we have been able to screen a panel of candidate drugs for antiviral activity, under normal level 2 containment. We compared the activities of 8 different antivirals from 3 drug classes, including drugs repurposed for the treatment of Ebola: type I interferons and nucleoside analogs. Our data indicate that IFN-ß is a potent inhibitor of Ebola virus, contributing to the decision to conduct a clinical trial of IFN-ß treatment for Ebola virus disease in Guinea. Moreover, we identified that 2 and 3 drug combinations inhibit Ebola replication when administered 24 hours post-infection. Drug combinations have important implications for clinical use, since lower doses of each drug are administered, potentially decreasing side-effects and, based on different mechanisms of action, there is less likelihood for the emergence of drug resistance. These studies set the stage for both preclinical and clinical evaluation.

"Acute encephalitis is an important and severe disease in children in Vietnam. However, little is known about the etiology while such knowledge is essential for optimal prevention and treatment. To identify viral causes of encephalitis, in 2004 we conducted a one-year descriptive study at Children's Hospital Number One, a referral hospital for children in southern Vietnam including Ho Chi Minh City.
Children less than 16 years of age presenting with acute encephalitis of presumed viral etiology were enrolled. Diagnostic efforts included viral culture, serology and real time (RT)-PCRs. A confirmed or probable viral causative agent was established in 41% of 194 enrolled patients. The most commonly diagnosed causative agent was Japanese encephalitis virus (n = 50, 26%), followed by enteroviruses (n = 18, 9.3%), dengue virus (n = 9, 4.6%), herpes simplex virus (n = 1), cytomegalovirus (n = 1) and influenza A virus (n = 1). Fifty-seven (29%) children died acutely. Fatal outcome was independently associated with patient age and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission.
Acute encephalitis in children in southern Vietnam is associated with high mortality. Although the etiology remains unknown in a majority of the patients, the result from the present study may be useful for future design of treatment and prevention strategies of the disease. The recognition of GCS and age as predictive factors may be helpful for clinicians in managing the patient.
","Viral encephalitis is associated with high morbidity and mortality in Vietnam. However little is known about the causes of the disease due to a lack of diagnostic facilities in this relatively resource-poor setting. Knowledge about the etiologies and clinical outcome of viral encephalitis is necessary for future design of intervention studies targeted at improvement of clinical management, treatment and prevention of the disease. We report the viral agents, clinical outcome and prognostic factors of mortality of encephalitis in children admitted to a referral hospital for children in southern Vietnam. We show that about one third of the enrolled patients die acutely, and that mortality is independently associated with patient age and Glasgow Coma Scale on admission. Japanese encephalitis, dengue virus and enterovirus (including enterovirus 71) are the major viruses detected in our patients. However, more than half of the patients remain undiagnosed, while mortality in this group is as high as in the diagnosed group. This study will benefit clinicians and public health in terms of clinical management and prevention of childhood encephalitis in Vietnam.

"Integrin clustering plays a pivotal role in a host of cell functions. Hetero-dimeric integrin adhesion receptors regulate cell migration, survival, and differentiation by communicating signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane. Thus far, crystallographic structures of integrin components are solved only separately, and for some integrin types. Also, the sequence of interactions that leads to signal transduction remains ambiguous. Particularly, it remains controversial whether the homo-dimerization of integrin transmembrane domains occurs following the integrin activation (i.e. when integrin ectodomain is stretched out) or if it regulates integrin clustering. This study employs molecular dynamics modeling approaches to address these questions in molecular details and sheds light on the crucial effect of the plasma membrane. Conducting a normal mode analysis of the intact αllbβ3 integrin, it is demonstrated that the ectodomain and transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains are connected via a membrane-proximal hinge region, thus merely transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains are modeled. By measuring the free energy change and force required to form integrin homo-oligomers, this study suggests that the β-subunit homo-oligomerization potentially regulates integrin clustering, as opposed to α-subunit, which appears to be a poor regulator for the clustering process. If α-subunits are to regulate the clustering they should overcome a high-energy barrier formed by a stable lipid pack around them. Finally, an outside-in activation-clustering scenario is speculated, explaining how further loading the already-active integrin affects its homo-oligomerization so that focal adhesions grow in size.
","Focal adhesions are complex, dynamic structures of multiple proteins that act as the cell's mechanical anchorage to its surrounding. Integrins are proteins linking the cell inner and outer environments, which act as a bridge that crosses the cell membrane. Integrins respond to mechanical loads exerted to them by changing their conformations. Several diseases, such as atherosclerosis and different types of cancer, are caused by altered function of integrins. Essential to the formation of focal adhesions is the process of integrin clustering. Bidirectional integrin signaling involves conformational changes in this protein, clustering, and finally the assembly of a large intracellular adhesion complex. Integrin clustering is defined as the interaction of integrins to form lateral assemblies that eventually lead to focal adhesion formation. The effect of the plasma membrane on formation of integrin clusters has been largely neglected in current literature; subsequently some apparently contradictory data has been reported by a number of researchers in the field. Using a molecular dynamics modeling approach, a computational method that simulates systems in a full-atomic scale, we probe the role of the plasma membrane in integrin clustering and hypothesize a clustering scenario that explains the relationship between integrin activation and focal adhesion growth.

"Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is the species most frequently implicated with cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in the Americas; its diagnosis is based on the identification of amastigotes in lesions, which is limited by low parasite burden. Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) is a support tool for diagnosis, based on delayed type hypersensitivity responses to Leishmania antigens injected intradermally, used in endemic areas as a complement to diagnosis. A retrospective analysis of individuals evaluated for their first episode of tegumentary leishmaniasis at a reference center in Argentina during the period 2006–2015 was performed, with the goal of assessing its usefulness as a support tool in the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Demographic, clinical and diagnostic work-up were analyzed in individuals with clinically compatible lesions, lesion`s smear and LST. A total of 733 cases that met the case definition were included in the analysis; 678 (93%) localized cutaneous cases, 50 (7%) with mucosal involvement and 5 (<1%) disseminated. Diagnostic confirmation was reached in 474 (65%) cases through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 cases among this group having negative LST. Among smear negative cases, 190 were negative also by LST, but in 69 instances LST was positive. Across age groups, similar ratios of sensitivity between smear and LST were calculated. Lesions older than 21 days-old were found to correlate with positive results both for smear and LST significantly more than younger lesions. These findings support the clinical use of LST as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis across all age groups even in endemic areas. In this analysis, the correlation with smear was high. Standardization of this technique and further research into its most adequate preparation and utilization protocols across different sites will help in the management of suspicious clinical cases.
","American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) is a vector borne Neglected Tropical Disease with skin ulcers as the main clinical manifestation. Diagnosis is suspected when characteristic lesions occur in patients in areas known to be endemic and confirmed with microscopic identification of amastigotes in samples obtained from lesions. The Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) is an aid in the diagnosis based on the elicitation of delayed type hypersensitivity responses upon exposure to Leishmania antigens injected intradermally into the patient´s forearm and measured as the induration size after 48 hours. This analysis of 733 cases, which is the largest series of cases evaluating the role of LST in ACL highlights and establishes the usefulness of this complementary diagnostic tool with a strong correlation with lesion smear and a demonstration that false positive responses due to previous exposure to the parasite are not of concern. The results support the use of LST in endemic areas to assist in guiding clinical decisions regarding treatment initiation.

"As circulating monocytes enter the site of disease, the local microenvironment instructs their differentiation into tissue macrophages (MΦ). To identify mechanisms that regulate MΦ differentiation, we studied human leprosy as a model, since M1-type antimicrobial MΦ predominate in lesions in the self-limited form, whereas M2-type phagocytic MΦ are characteristic of the lesions in the progressive form. Using a heterotypic co-culture model, we found that unstimulated endothelial cells (EC) trigger monocytes to become M2 MΦ. However, biochemical screens identified that IFN-γ and two families of small molecules activated EC to induce monocytes to differentiate into M1 MΦ. The gene expression profiles induced in these activated EC, when overlapped with the transcriptomes of human leprosy lesions, identified Jagged1 (JAG1) as a potential regulator of MΦ differentiation. JAG1 protein was preferentially expressed in the lesions from the self-limited form of leprosy, and localized to the vascular endothelium. The ability of activated EC to induce M1 MΦ was JAG1-dependent and the addition of JAG1 to quiescent EC facilitated monocyte differentiation into M1 MΦ with antimicrobial activity against M. leprae. Our findings indicate a potential role for the IFN-γ-JAG1 axis in instructing MΦ differentiation as part of the host defense response at the site of disease in human leprosy.
","Mycobacterial diseases, such as leprosy, continue to be serious causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. They pose a unique treatment challenge due to their ability to modify the immune response in infected individuals. For example, in leprosy there are two distinct manifestations of the disease, each characterized by the immune response of the individual. One results in a more disseminated and severe form of the disease, lepromatous leprosy, and the other is a more limited form with marked antimicrobial activity, tuberculoid leprosy. These differences in the immune response can be characterized by the phenotype and activation state of the macrophage. We illustrate how the local endothelial microenvironment can “educate” macrophages, identifying Jagged1 and select small molecules that can regulate this pathway. Therefore, these studies identify a potential strategy to intervene in infection and inflammation, by targeting macrophage instruction at the site of disease. Through the integration of in vitro modeling and gene expression profiles at the site of disease, we found that Jagged 1 harnesses the endothelial microenvironment to instruct antimicrobial macrophage responses in leprosy.

"Identifying molecular connections between developmental processes and disease can lead to new hypotheses about health risks at all stages of life. Here we introduce a new approach to identifying significant connections between gene sets and disease genes, and apply it to several gene sets related to human development. To overcome the limits of incomplete and imperfect information linking genes to disease, we pool genes within disease subtrees in the MeSH taxonomy, and we demonstrate that such pooling improves the power and accuracy of our approach. Significance is assessed through permutation. We created a web-based visualization tool to facilitate multi-scale exploration of this large collection of significant connections (http://gda.cs.tufts.edu/development). High-level analysis of the results reveals expected connections between tissue-specific developmental processes and diseases linked to those tissues, and widespread connections to developmental disorders and cancers. Yet interesting new hypotheses may be derived from examining the unexpected connections. We highlight and discuss the implications of three such connections, linking dementia with bone development, polycystic ovary syndrome with cardiovascular development, and retinopathy of prematurity with lung development. Our results provide additional evidence that  plays a key role in the early pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome. Our evidence also suggests that the VEGF pathway and downstream NFKB signaling may explain the complex relationship between bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity, and may form a bridge between two currently-competing hypotheses about the molecular origins of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Further data exploration and similar queries about other gene sets may generate a variety of new information about the molecular relationships between additional diseases.
","Understanding the roles that genes involved in normal human development can play in disease processes is an important part of predicting disease risk and designing novel treatment approaches. In this study, we have identified classes of disease that are associated with a surprisingly large number of genes involved in any of several tissue-specific developmental processes. To do so, we developed a novel approach whose strength comes from pooling genetic information across related diseases, overcoming problems ordinarily posed by limited information about individual gene-disease relationships. We demonstrate the method's efficacy both by examining its ability to highlight connections between gene sets and disease classes that are known to be related, and by demonstrating that the approach recovers expected broad classes of connections, such as those between heart development and cardiovascular disorders. However, by examining unexpected connections in this data set, we are able to develop new understanding of some surprising disease relationships, such as the one between dementia and osteoporosis. Such connections may lead to a better overall understanding of the role of development in lifelong health, as well as to the design of new methods to treat a range of diseases.

"We have developed an easy-to-use and memory-efficient method called PhenotypeSeeker that (a) identifies phenotype-specific k-mers, (b) generates a k-mer-based statistical model for predicting a given phenotype and (c) predicts the phenotype from the sequencing data of a given bacterial isolate. The method was validated on 167 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (virulence), 200 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (ciprofloxacin resistance) and 459 Clostridium difficile isolates (azithromycin resistance). The phenotype prediction models trained from these datasets obtained the F1-measure of 0.88 on the K. pneumoniae test set, 0.88 on the P. aeruginosa test set and 0.97 on the C. difficile test set. The F1-measures were the same for assembled sequences and raw sequencing data; however, building the model from assembled genomes is significantly faster. On these datasets, the model building on a mid-range Linux server takes approximately 3 to 5 hours per phenotype if assembled genomes are used and 10 hours per phenotype if raw sequencing data are used. The phenotype prediction from assembled genomes takes less than one second per isolate. Thus, PhenotypeSeeker should be well-suited for predicting phenotypes from large sequencing datasets. PhenotypeSeeker is implemented in Python programming language, is open-source software and is available at GitHub (https://github.com/bioinfo-ut/PhenotypeSeeker/).
","Predicting phenotypic properties of bacterial isolates from their genomic sequences has numerous potential applications. A good example would be prediction of antimicrobial resistance and virulence phenotypes for use in medical diagnostics. We have developed a method that is able to predict phenotypes of interest from the genomic sequence of the isolate within seconds. The method uses a statistical model that can be trained automatically on isolates with known phenotype. The method is implemented in Python programming language and can be run on low-end Linux server and/or on laptop computers.

"Helminth co-infection in humans is common in tropical regions of the world where transmission of soil-transmitted helminths such as Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the hookworms Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale as well as other helminths such as Schistosoma mansoni often occur simultaneously.
We investigated whether co-infection with another helminth(s) altered the human immune response to crude antigen extracts from either different stages of N. americanus infection (infective third stage or adult) or different crude antigen extract preparations (adult somatic and adult excretory/secretory). Using these antigens, we compared the cellular and humoral immune responses of individuals mono-infected with hookworm (N. americanus) and individuals co-infected with hookworm and other helminth infections, namely co-infection with either A. lumbricoides, Schistosoma mansoni, or both. Immunological variables were compared between hookworm infection group (mono- versus co-infected) by bootstrap, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a data reduction method.
Contrary to several animal studies of helminth co-infection, we found that co-infected individuals had a further downmodulated Th1 cytokine response (e.g., reduced INF-γ), accompanied by a significant increase in the hookworm-specific humoral immune response (e.g. higher levels of IgE or IgG4 to crude antigen extracts) compared with mono- infected individuals. Neither of these changes was associated with a reduction of hookworm infection intensity in helminth co-infected individuals. From the standpoint of hookworm vaccine development, these results are relevant; i.e., the specific immune response to hookworm vaccine antigens might be altered by infection with another helminth.
","Parasitic infections in humans are common in tropical regions and under bad housing and sanitation conditions multiple parasitic infections are the rule rather than the exception. For helminth infections, which are thought to affect almost a quarter of the world's population, most common combinations include soil-transmitted helminths, such as hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm, as well as extra-intestinal infections by schistosomes. In order to develop and test a hookworm vaccine in endemic areas, the understanding of the impact of multiple helminth infections (co-infection) on the immune response against hookworm in infected individuals is crucial. The authors report in their article, that several parameters of the cellular (T cell markers, cytokines, chemokines) and humoral immune response (e.g. IgG4 and IgE antibodies) against hookworm are significantly affected or modulated in individuals co-infected with hookworm, roundworm and/or schistosomes. These results imply that the immune response against components of a hookworm vaccine might be altered by previous contact with other helminth species in endemic areas.

"While an increasing number of conserved small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are known to function in general bacterial physiology, the roles and modes of action of sRNAs from horizontally acquired genomic regions remain little understood. The IsrK sRNA of Gifsy-1 prophage of Salmonella belongs to the latter class. This regulatory RNA exists in two isoforms. The first forms, when a portion of transcripts originating from isrK promoter reads-through the IsrK transcription-terminator producing a translationally inactive mRNA target. Acting in trans, the second isoform, short IsrK RNA, binds the inactive transcript rendering it translationally active. By switching on translation of the first isoform, short IsrK indirectly activates the production of AntQ, an antiterminator protein located upstream of isrK. Expression of antQ globally interferes with transcription termination resulting in bacterial growth arrest and ultimately cell death. Escherichia coli and Salmonella cells expressing AntQ display condensed chromatin morphology and localization of UvrD to the nucleoid. The toxic phenotype of AntQ can be rescued by co-expression of the transcription termination factor, Rho, or RNase H, which protects genomic DNA from breaks by resolving R-loops. We propose that AntQ causes conflicts between transcription and replication machineries and thus promotes DNA damage. The isrK locus represents a unique example of an island-encoded sRNA that exerts a highly complex regulatory mechanism to tune the expression of a toxic protein.
","As the function of conserved core-genome-encoded small RNAs (sRNA) reflects the basic lifestyle of bacteria, the function of non-conserved island-encoded sRNAs remains enigmatic. The island-encoded sRNA IsrK belongs to Gifsy-1 prophage of Salmonella. Here, we report a complex mechanism in which the IsrK RNA functions as both sRNA and mRNA to control the production of the toxic AntQ protein. The isrK promoter directs the synthesis of two distinct RNA species: a full-length translationally inactive target mRNA and the correctly terminated, shorter IsrK sRNA. IsrK sRNA binds the full-length inactive mRNA producing an antiterminator protein, AntQ, which interferes with transcription termination. Expression of antQ results in bacterial growth arrest and ultimately cell death. Fluorescence microscopy of E. coli and Salmonella expressing antQ revealed condensed chromatin morphology as observed upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents. We propose that expression of the phage antiterminator protein results in conflicts between transcription and replication machineries and thus facilitates DNA damage. In summary, the RNA regulator IsrK presents a new regulatory principle in which a horizontally acquired sRNA controls genome integrity.

"Cell entry of many enveloped viruses occurs by engagement with cellular receptors, followed by internalization into endocytic compartments and pH-induced membrane fusion. A previously unnoticed step of receptor switching was found to be critical during cell entry of two devastating human pathogens: Ebola and Lassa viruses. Our recent studies revealed the functional role of receptor switching to LAMP1 for triggering membrane fusion by Lassa virus and showed the involvement of conserved histidines in this switching, suggesting that other viruses from this family may also switch to LAMP1. However, when we investigated viruses that are genetically close to Lassa virus, we discovered that they cannot bind LAMP1. A crystal structure of the receptor-binding module from Morogoro virus revealed structural differences that allowed mapping of the LAMP1 binding site to a unique set of Lassa residues not shared by other viruses in its family, illustrating a key difference in the cell-entry mechanism of Lassa virus that may contribute to its pathogenicity.
","To infect, enveloped viruses need to fuse their membrane with the host membrane. Fusion is mediated by special glycoprotein machineries that must be triggered only at the right time and at the right place. A major cue that viruses utilize for triggering is acidic pH. Until recently, such pH-induced triggering was assumed to be the only mechanism used by the Arenaviridae family. However, Lassa virus, a notorious pathogenic member of this family, was shown to use the binding to an intracellular receptor named LAMP1 to potentiate its pH-induced triggering. This two-step mechanism was a surprising finding that raised critical questions regarding the cell-entry mechanisms of other viruses from this family. Here we used a structure-guided approach to investigate whether other Arenaviridae utilize LAMP1 for cell entry. We mapped the LAMP1 binding site on the Lassa-derived glycoprotein and confirmed its identity using grafting experiments. This mapping revealed the unique sequence signature needed for LAMP1 binding. Sequence analysis suggests that no other members of the Arenaviridae bind LAMP1.

"We propose a biophysical model of Escherichia coli that predicts growth rate and an effective cellular composition from an effective, coarse-grained representation of its genome. We assume that E. coli is in a state of balanced exponential steady-state growth, growing in a temporally and spatially constant environment, rich in resources. We apply this model to a series of past measurements, where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio have been measured for seven E. coli strains with an rRNA operon copy number ranging from one to seven (the wild-type copy number). These experiments show that growth rate markedly decreases for strains with fewer than six copies. Using the model, we were able to reproduce these measurements. We show that the model that best fits these data suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied. Moreover, the model predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven results in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming that under such overcrowded conditions prolonged diffusion times tend to weaken binding affinities, the model predicts that growth rate will not increase substantially beyond the wild-type growth rate, as indicated by other experiments. Our model therefore suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy number of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does not substantially increase their growth rate. Other observations regarding strains with an altered rRNA operon copy number, such as nucleoid compaction and the rRNA operon feedback response, appear to be qualitatively consistent with this model. In addition, we discuss possible design principles suggested by the model and propose further experiments to test its validity.
","A bacterium like E. coli can be thought of as a self-replicating factory, where inventory synthesis, degradation, and management is concerted according to a well-defined set of rules encoded in the organism's genome. Since the organism's survival depends on this set of rules, these rules were most likely optimized by evolution. Therefore, by writing down these rules, what could one learn about Escherichia coli? We examined E. coli growing in the simplest imaginable environment, one constant in space and time and rich in resources, and attempted to identify the rules that relate the genome to the cell composition and self-replication time. With more than 4,400 genes, a full-scale model would be prohibitively complicated, and therefore we “coarse-grained” E. coli by lumping together genes and proteins of similar function. We used this model to examine measurements of strains with reduced copy number of ribosomal-RNA genes, and also to show that increasing this copy number overcrowds the cell with ribosomes and proteins. As a result, there appears to be an optimum copy number with respect to the wild-type genome, in agreement with observation. We hope that this model will improve and further challenge our understanding of bacterial physiology, also in more complicated environments.

"Blinding trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is targeted for global elimination by 2020. Knowledge of risk factors can help target control interventions.
As part of a cluster randomised controlled trial, we assessed the baseline prevalence of, and risk factors for, active trachoma and ocular C. trachomatis infection in randomly selected children aged 0–5 years from 48 Gambian and 36 Tanzanian communities. Both children's eyes were examined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) simplified grading system, and an ocular swab was taken from each child's right eye and processed by Amplicor polymerase chain reaction to test for the presence of C. trachomatis DNA. Prevalence of active trachoma was 6.7% (335/5033) in The Gambia and 32.3% (1008/3122) in Tanzania. The countries' corresponding Amplicor positive prevalences were 0.8% and 21.9%. After adjustment, risk factors for follicular trachoma (TF) in both countries were ocular or nasal discharge, a low level of household head education, and being aged ≥1 year. Additional risk factors in Tanzania were flies on the child's face, being Amplicor positive, and crowding (the number of children per household). The risk factors for being Amplicor positive in Tanzania were similar to those for TF, with the exclusion of flies and crowding. In The Gambia, only ocular discharge was associated with being Amplicor positive.
These results indicate that although the prevalence of active trachoma and Amplicor positives were very different between the two countries, the risk factors for active trachoma were similar but those for being Amplicor positive were different. The lack of an association between being Amplicor positive and TF in The Gambia highlights the poor correlation between the presence of trachoma clinical signs and evidence of C. trachomatis infection in this setting. Only ocular discharge was associated with evidence of C. trachomatis DNA in The Gambia, suggesting that at this low endemicity, this may be the most important risk factor.
ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00792922
","Trachoma is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and is the leading infectious cause of blindness. The World Health Organization's (WHO) control strategy includes antibiotic treatment of all community members, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvements. By determining how prevalent trachoma is, decisions can be made whether control activities need to be put in place. Knowing what factors make people more at risk of having trachoma can help target trachoma control efforts to those most at risk. We looked at the prevalence of active trachoma and C. trachomatis infection in the eyes of children aged 0–5 years in The Gambia and Tanzania. We also measured risk factors associated with having active trachoma or infection. The prevalence of both active trachoma and infection was lower in The Gambia (6.7% and 0.8%, respectively) than in Tanzania (32.3% and 21.9%, respectively). Risk factors for active trachoma were similar in the two countries. For infection, the risk factors in Tanzania were similar to those for TF, whereas in The Gambia, only ocular discharge was associated with infection. These results show that although the prevalence of active trachoma and infection is very different between the two countries, the risk factors for active trachoma are similar but those for infection are different.

"The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to thrive in its phagosomal niche is critical for its establishment of a chronic infection. This requires that Mtb senses and responds to intraphagosomal signals such as pH. We hypothesized that Mtb would respond to additional intraphagosomal factors that correlate with maturation. Here, we demonstrate that [Cl−] and pH correlate inversely with phagosome maturation, and identify Cl− as a novel environmental cue for Mtb. Mtb responds to Cl− and pH synergistically, in part through the activity of the two-component regulator phoPR. Following identification of promoters responsive to Cl− and pH, we generated a reporter Mtb strain that detected immune-mediated changes in the phagosomal environment during infection in a mouse model. Our study establishes Cl− and pH as linked environmental cues for Mtb, and illustrates the utility of reporter bacterial strains for the study of Mtb-host interactions in vivo.
","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis, a disease that remains a major global health problem. To ensure its long-term survival in the host, Mtb must be able to sense and respond to changes in its immediate environment, such as the pH differences that occur in the phagosome in which it lives. Knowledge of the external signals that Mtb recognizes during infection is critical for understanding the impact of the microenvironment on Mtb pathogenesis and persistence, and how Mtb interacts with its host cell. We show here that [Cl−] correlates inversely with pH as the phagosome matures, and identify [Cl−] as a novel cue that Mtb responds to, in synergism with pH. By constructing a Mtb strain that fluorescently reports on changes in [Cl−] and pH, we find using a mouse model of infection that environmental alterations in Mtb's phagosomal home are mediated at the local level by activities of the host immune system. Our study demonstrates how a pathogen can exploit linked environmental cues during infection, and shows the value of reporter bacterial strains for Mtb-host whole animal studies.

"Correct gene expression requires tight RNA quality control both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Using a splicing-defective allele of PASTICCINO2 (PAS2), a gene essential for plant development, we isolated suppressor mutations modifying pas2-1 mRNA profiles and restoring wild-type growth. Three suppressor of pas2 (sop) mutations modified the degradation of mis-spliced pas2-1 mRNA species, allowing the synthesis of a functional protein. Cloning of the suppressor mutations identified the core subunit of the exosome SOP2/RRP4, the exosome nucleoplasmic cofactor SOP3/HEN2 and a novel zinc-finger protein SOP1 that colocalizes with HEN2 in nucleoplasmic foci. The three SOP proteins counteract post-transcriptional (trans)gene silencing (PTGS), which suggests that they all act in RNA quality control. In addition, sop1 mutants accumulate some, but not all of the misprocessed mRNAs and other types of RNAs that are observed in exosome mutants. Taken together, our data show that SOP1 is a new component of nuclear RNA surveillance that is required for the degradation of a specific subset of nuclear exosome targets.
","Cells use various RNA quality control mechanisms to monitore the correct expression of their genome. Indeed, gene transcription can often generate faulty transcripts that are rapidly degraded to avoid possible deleterious effects to the cell. RNA degradation by the exosome is the main pathway for the removal of unwanted RNA in all kingdoms. Recognition of aberrant RNA involves a number of RNA binding proteins and other factors that target them for degradation by the exosome. Here, we used a genetic approach to identify proteins involved in the degradation of a mis-spliced RNA by the nuclear exosome in plants. Our screen identified two known components of nuclear RNA degradation pathway, namely the exosome core subunit RRP4 and the exosome-associated RNA helicase HEN2 that is required for the elimination of non-ribosomal RNAs by the nuclear exosome. Furthermore, we identified SOP1 as a novel putative exosome cofactor that is required for the degradation of some, but not all, of the substrates of HEN2.

"Atrial tachy-arrhytmias, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), are characterised by irregular electrical activity in the atria, generally associated with erratic excitation underlain by re-entrant scroll waves, fibrillatory conduction of multiple wavelets or rapid focal activity. Epidemiological studies have shown an increase in AF prevalence in the developed world associated with an ageing society, highlighting the need for effective treatment options. Catheter ablation therapy, commonly used in the treatment of AF, requires spatial information on atrial electrical excitation. The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a method for non-invasive identification of the presence of arrhythmia, due to irregularity in the ECG signal associated with atrial activation compared to sinus rhythm, but has limitations in providing specific spatial information. There is therefore a pressing need to develop novel methods to identify and locate the origin of arrhythmic excitation. Invasive methods provide direct information on atrial activity, but may induce clinical complications. Non-invasive methods avoid such complications, but their development presents a greater challenge due to the non-direct nature of monitoring. Algorithms based on the ECG signals in multiple leads (e.g. a 64-lead vest) may provide a viable approach. In this study, we used a biophysically detailed model of the human atria and torso to investigate the correlation between the morphology of the ECG signals from a 64-lead vest and the location of the origin of rapid atrial excitation arising from rapid focal activity and/or re-entrant scroll waves. A focus-location algorithm was then constructed from this correlation. The algorithm had success rates of 93% and 76% for correctly identifying the origin of focal and re-entrant excitation with a spatial resolution of 40 mm, respectively. The general approach allows its application to any multi-lead ECG system. This represents a significant extension to our previously developed algorithms to predict the AF origins in association with focal activities.
","Atrial tachy-arrhythmias are associated with irregular excitation waves arising from re-entrant excitation, multiple wavelets or rapid focal activity. Identifying the origin of the irregular activity may be vital for diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. Where invasive and non-invasive methods provide approaches for such identification, both have associated disadvantages. In this study, we used a biophysically detailed model of the human atria and torso to develop an algorithm based on the correlation between the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal from a 64-lead vest and the location of rapid focal and re-entrant excitation. Using the properties of the atrial activation and the ECG signals, we developed a focus-location algorithm which is able to distinguish rapid focal activity from re-entrant scroll waves centred in the same location. Based on simulated data, the algorithm had success rates of 93% and 76% for correctly identifying the origin of focal and re-entrant excitation, respectively, and 88% for distinguish focal and re-entrant excitation, with no false positives. Inherited from our previous algorithm, it is also easily generalizable to any multi-lead ECG system.

"Under-five mortality is declining in Ghana and many other countries. Very few studies have measured under-five mortality—and its social and environmental risk factors—at fine spatial resolutions, which is relevant for policy purposes. Our aim was to estimate under-five mortality and its social and environmental risk factors at the district level in Ghana.
We used 10% random samples of Ghana’s 2000 and 2010 National Population and Housing Censuses. We applied indirect demographic methods and a Bayesian spatial model to the information on total number of children ever born and children surviving to estimate under-five mortality (probability of dying by 5 y of age, 5q0) for each of Ghana’s 110 districts. We also used the census data to estimate the distributions of households or persons in each district in terms of fuel used for cooking, sanitation facility, drinking water source, and parental education. Median district 5q0 declined from 99 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 70 in 2010. The decline ranged from <5% in some northern districts, where 5q0 had been higher in 2000, to >40% in southern districts, where it had been lower in 2000, exacerbating existing inequalities. Primary education increased in men and women, and more households had access to improved water and sanitation and cleaner cooking fuels. Higher use of liquefied petroleum gas for cooking was associated with lower 5q0 in multivariate analysis.
Under-five mortality has declined in all of Ghana’s districts, but the cross-district inequality in mortality has increased. There is a need for additional data, including on healthcare, and additional environmental and socioeconomic measurements, to understand the reasons for the variations in mortality levels and trends.
","Deaths among children younger than five years old have been declining worldwide for the past few decades. Children’s death rates in sub-Saharan Africa, although also declining, remain higher than in other regions.
Ghana has performed better than most other sub-Saharan African countries in terms of reducing child deaths, but we lack information on how much child mortality varies in different parts of Ghana.
Also, it is not known how factors such as low education of mothers or not having clean water or improved toilet facilities that increase the risk of illness and death among children vary in different parts of Ghana.
The purpose of our study was to provide information on changes in the child death rate, and the social and environmental factors associated with it, for all of Ghana’s 110 districts between the years 2000 and 2010.
Information from two national censuses in 2000 and 2010 and sophisticated statistical models were used to make estimates of the child death rate in each district for the years 2000 and 2010 and for change between these two years.
The risk of children dying before they reach age five was higher in northern Ghana than it was in the southern part of the country.
Child death rates went down in every district in Ghana between 2000 and 2010, but progress was slower in northern Ghana than in the southern part of the country.
More women and men in the country had completed primary school education in 2010 than in 2000, and more homes had access to clean water and improved toilet facilities and cleaner cooking fuels like liquefied petroleum gas.
Use of liquefied petroleum gas for cooking may reduce the risk of child death in Ghana.
There should be strategies to help districts where young children are at a relatively higher risk of dying, largely those in northern Ghana, to catch up with those districts with lower child mortality.
Some of the actions needed may be related to social and environmental factors like education, clean sanitation, and cooking fuels. But it is likely that there is an important role for healthcare, which was not investigated in this study.
It is important for Ghana and other sub-Saharan African countries to improve the measurement and monitoring of child mortality and its social, environmental, and healthcare risk factors at the community level.

"The effectiveness of rabies vaccination in both humans and animals is determined by the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs). The Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT) is the method traditionally used for detection and quantification of VNAs. It is a functional in vitro test for assessing the ability of antibodies in serum to bind and prevent infection of cultured cells with rabies virus (RABV). The RFFIT is a labor intensive, low throughput and semi-quantitative assay performed by trained laboratorians. It requires staining of RABV-infected cells by rabies specific fluorescent antibodies and manual quantification of fluorescent fields for titer determination. Although the quantification of fluorescent fields observed in each sample is recorded, the corresponding images are not stored or captured to be used for future analysis. To circumvent several of these disadvantages, we have developed an alternative, automated high throughput neutralization test (HTNT) for determination of rabies VNAs based on green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression by a recombinant RABV and compared with the RFFIT. The HTNT assay utilizes the recombinant RABV ERA variant expressing GFP with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for efficient quantification. The HTNT is a quantitative method where the number of RABV-infected cells are determined and the images are stored for future analysis. Both RFFIT and HTNT results correlated 100% for a panel of human and animal positive and negative rabies serum samples. Although, the VNA titer values are generally agreeable, HTNT titers tend to be lower than that of RFFIT, probably due to the differences in quantification methods. Our data demonstrates the potential for HTNT assays in determination of rabies VNA titers.
","The potency of rabies vaccine is demonstrated by the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in serum. It is critical to evaluate immunologic status of individuals who work directly with rabies virus (RABV) (laboratorians) or at high risk of infection due to interaction with animals (veterinarians and animal control workers). In addition, rabies vaccination records and demonstration of VNAs in animals are mandatory before initiating pet travel to rabies-free counties or regions. Rabies VNAs are currently determined by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) and the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test, which measure the ability of antibodies to bind and prevent infection of RABV in vitro. Both assays require staining of infected cells using anti-rabies antibodies and manual observation of infected cells by a fluorescent microscope to determine VNA titers. In this study, we have developed a GFP reporter-based high throughput neutralization test (HTNT) for automated quantification of infected cells. This method has the advantages of allowing investigators to analyze and store the results, and can accommodate large sample sizes. Overall, the results from HTNT exhibited 100% correlation with that of RFFIT, albeit with differences in rabies VNA titer values due to quantification methods.

"Elongator is a six subunit protein complex, conserved from yeast to humans. Mutations in the human Elongator homologue, hELP1, are associated with the neurological disease familial dysautonomia. However, how Elongator functions in metazoans, and how the human mutations affect neural functions is incompletely understood. Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, ELPC-1 and ELPC-3, components of the Elongator complex, are required for the formation of the 5-carbamoylmethyl and 5-methylcarboxymethyl side chains of wobble uridines in tRNA. The lack of these modifications leads to defects in translation in C. elegans. ELPC-1::GFP and ELPC-3::GFP reporters are strongly expressed in a subset of chemosensory neurons required for salt chemotaxis learning. elpc-1 or elpc-3 gene inactivation causes a defect in this process, associated with a posttranscriptional reduction of neuropeptide and a decreased accumulation of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. elpc-1 and elpc-3 mutations are synthetic lethal together with those in tuc-1, which is required for thiolation of tRNAs having the 5′methylcarboxymethyl side chain. elpc-1; tuc-1 and elpc-3; tuc-1 double mutants display developmental defects. Our results suggest that, by its effect on tRNA modification, Elongator promotes both neural function and development.
","The efficiency of protein synthesis can be modulated by alterations of various components of the translation machinery. In translation, transfer RNAs act as adapter molecules that decode mRNA into protein and thereby play a central role in gene expression. In the tRNA maturation process, a subset of the normal nucleosides undergoes modifications. Modified nucleosides in the tRNA anticodon region are important for efficient translation. We found that, in the worm C. elegans, components of the Elongator complex are required for the formation of a certain set of tRNA modifications in the anticodon region. We observed a reduced efficiency of translation as well as a lower production of neurotransmitters in Elongator mutant worms. Elongator is conserved in eukaryotes, and mutations in a subunit of human Elongator cause a severe neurodegenerative disease, familial dysautonomia (FD). It is unclear in humans whether Elongator acts on the translational level through tRNA modification to regulate neuronal processes. Our observations in C. elegans, together with the role of yeast Elongator in translation, show that the function of Elongator in tRNA modification is conserved. Inactivation of Elongator may cause neuronal defects by affecting translation.

"Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily controlling energy homeostasis; however, its precise role in regulating antiviral innate immunity remains to be clarified. Here, we showed that ERRα deficiency conferred resistance to viral infection both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, ERRα inhibited the production of type-I interferon (IFN-I) and the expression of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Furthermore, we found that viral infection induced TBK1-dependent ERRα stabilization, which in turn associated with TBK1 and IRF3 to impede the formation of TBK1-IRF3, IRF3 phosphorylation, IRF3 dimerization, and the DNA binding affinity of IRF3. The effect of ERRα on IFN-I production was independent of its transcriptional activity and PCG-1α. Notably, ERRα chemical inhibitor XCT790 has broad antiviral potency. This work not only identifies ERRα as a critical negative regulator of antiviral signaling, but also provides a potential target for future antiviral therapy.

"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) cause severe diarrhoea in humans and neonatal farm animals. Annually, 380,000 human deaths, and multi-million dollar losses in the farming industry, can be attributed to ETEC infections. Illness results from the action of enterotoxins, which disrupt signalling pathways that manage water and electrolyte homeostasis in the mammalian gut. The resulting fluid loss is treated by oral rehydration. Hence, aqueous solutions of glucose and salt are ingested by the patient. Given the central role of enterotoxins in disease, we have characterised the regulatory trigger that controls toxin production. We show that, at the molecular level, the trigger is comprised of two gene regulatory proteins, CRP and H-NS. Strikingly, this renders toxin expression sensitive to both conditions encountered on host cell attachment and the components of oral rehydration therapy. For example, enterotoxin expression is induced by salt in an H-NS dependent manner. Furthermore, depending on the toxin gene, expression is activated or repressed by glucose. The precise sensitivity of the regulatory trigger to glucose differs because of variations in the regulatory setup for each toxin encoding gene.
","Diarrheagenic illness remains a major disease burden in the developing world. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the leading bacterial cause of such disease; hundreds of millions of cases occur every year. The severe watery diarrhoea associated with ETEC infections results from the action of enterotoxins. The toxins target human gut epithelial cells and trigger the loss of water and electrolytes into the gut lumen. Oral rehydration therapy can counteract this process. Hence, glucose and salt solutions promote rehydration of the patient. In this work we show that the gene regulatory mechanisms controlling toxin expression respond directly to sugar and salt. Furthermore, we describe a molecular mechanism to explain these effects. Hence, we provide a starting point for the optimisation of oral rehydration solutions to reduce toxin expression over the course of an ETEC infection.

"The nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae is an emerging model organism that allows evolutionary comparisons with C. elegans and exploration of its own unique biological attributes. To produce a high-resolution C. briggsae recombination map, recombinant inbred lines were generated from reciprocal crosses between two strains and genotyped at over 1,000 loci. A second set of recombinant inbred lines involving a third strain was also genotyped at lower resolution. The resulting recombination maps exhibit discrete domains of high and low recombination, as in C. elegans, indicating these are a general feature of Caenorhabditis species. The proportion of a chromosome's physical size occupied by the central, low-recombination domain is highly correlated between species. However, the C. briggsae intra-species comparison reveals striking variation in the distribution of recombination between domains. Hybrid lines made with the more divergent pair of strains also exhibit pervasive marker transmission ratio distortion, evidence of selection acting on hybrid genotypes. The strongest effect, on chromosome III, is explained by a developmental delay phenotype exhibited by some hybrid F2 animals. In addition, on chromosomes IV and V, cross direction-specific biases towards one parental genotype suggest the existence of cytonuclear epistatic interactions. These interactions are discussed in relation to surprising mitochondrial genome polymorphism in C. briggsae, evidence that the two strains diverged in allopatry, the potential for local adaptation, and the evolution of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. The genetic and genomic resources resulting from this work will support future efforts to understand inter-strain divergence as well as facilitate studies of gene function, natural variation, and the evolution of recombination in Caenorhabditis nematodes.
","The nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae is increasingly used for comparisons with its more famous relative, C. elegans. To improve genomic resources for C. briggsae, we created two sets of inbred lines derived from crosses between diverged C. briggsae strains. High-throughput genotyping of these has improved the resolution of the recombination map and genome assembly. It also allows detailed comparisons of recombination both within and between species. Unexpectedly, we found that alleles from one parental strain were much more likely to be fixed on three of the six chromosomes in one of the sets of lines. One of these biases is caused by a pronounced developmental delay in F2 progeny that is seen in both reciprocal crosses, whereas the other two manifest in only one of the two cross directions. This indicates that the parental strains have diverged in both nuclear and nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions, either because of local adaptation or restricted gene flow across much of the genome.

"Recent efforts to cure human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection have focused on developing latency reversing agents as a first step to eradicate the latent reservoir. The histone deacetylase inhibitor, vorinostat, has been shown to activate HIV RNA transcription in CD4+ T-cells and alter host cell gene transcription in HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy. In order to understand how latently infected cells respond dynamically to vorinostat treatment and determine the impact of vorinostat on reservoir size in vivo, we have constructed viral dynamic models of latency that incorporate vorinostat treatment. We fitted these models to data collected from a recent clinical trial in which vorinostat was administered daily for 14 days to HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART. The results show that HIV transcription is increased transiently during the first few hours or days of treatment and that there is a delay before a sustained increase of HIV transcription, whose duration varies among study participants and may depend on the long term impact of vorinostat on host gene expression. Parameter estimation suggests that in latently infected cells, HIV transcription induced by vorinostat occurs at lower levels than in productively infected cells. Furthermore, the estimated loss rate of transcriptionally induced cells remains close to baseline in most study participants, suggesting vorinostat treatment does not induce latently infected cell killing and thus reduce the latent reservoir in vivo.
","Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV infection must be taken for life due to the existence of long lived latently infected cells. Recent efforts have focused on developing latency reversing agents to eliminate latently infected cells by activating HIV production. In this work, we assess the impact of a latency reversing agent, vorinostat, by fitting dynamic models to data from a clinical trial. Results show that vorinostat treatment induces HIV transcription transiently and that the sustained induction of HIV transcription may depend on the temporal impact of vorinostat on host gene expression. Our results also suggest that vorinostat treatment is not sufficient to induce killing of latently infected cells in a majority of HIV-infected individuals on cART.

"The natural reservoir of Influenza A is waterfowl. Normally, waterfowl viruses are not adapted to infect and spread in the human population. Sometimes, through reassortment or through whole host shift events, genetic material from waterfowl viruses is introduced into the human population causing worldwide pandemics. Identifying which mutations allow viruses from avian origin to spread successfully in the human population is of great importance in predicting and controlling influenza pandemics. Here we describe a novel approach to identify such mutations. We use a sitewise non-homogeneous phylogenetic model that explicitly takes into account differences in the equilibrium frequencies of amino acids in different hosts and locations. We identify 172 amino acid sites with strong support and 518 sites with moderate support of different selection constraints in human and avian viruses. The sites that we identify provide an invaluable resource to experimental virologists studying adaptation of avian flu viruses to the human host. Identification of the sequence changes necessary for host shifts would help us predict the pandemic potential of various strains. The method is of broad applicability to investigating changes in selective constraints when the timing of the changes is known.
","Influenza A's natural reservoir is waterfowl. Sometimes avian virus genomic segments are able to shift to a human host, either in toto or by combining with those that underwent a previous host shift event. Such host shift events can cause worldwide pandemics in their immunologically naive hosts. In order for these host shifts to establish a stable lineage, the virus has to adapt to the new host. Identifying the changes that have occurred in the past can provide important clues about how this process happens, and how surveillance for new influenza threats should be targeted. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine whether an amino acid has changed due to adaptation to the new host or whether the change occurred through random drift. Here we describe a novel phylogenetic approach to identifying locations where the nature of the selective pressure exerted on the location has changed corresponding to the host shift event. We identify a set of locations on a number of the genomic segments. The approach we describe is of wide applicability when the timing of the change of selective constraints is known in advance.

"Ecological communities are undeniably diverse, both in terms of the species that compose them as well as the type of interactions that link species to each other. Despite this long recognition of the coexistence of multiple interaction types in nature, little is known about the consequences of this diversity for community functioning. In the ongoing context of global change and increasing species extinction rates, it seems crucial to improve our understanding of the drivers of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, using a multispecies dynamical model of ecological communities including various interaction types (e.g. competition for space, predator interference, recruitment facilitation in addition to feeding), we studied the role of the presence and the intensity of these interactions for species diversity, community functioning (biomass and production) and the relationship between diversity and functioning.Taken jointly, the diverse interactions have significant effects on species diversity, whose amplitude and sign depend on the type of interactions involved and their relative abundance. They however consistently increase the slope of the relationship between diversity and functioning, suggesting that species losses might have stronger effects on community functioning than expected when ignoring the diversity of interaction types and focusing on feeding interactions only.
","The question of how species diversity contributes to the functioning of ecological communities has intrigued ecologists for decades, and is especially relevant in the current context of species extinctions. Ecological communities are not only diverse in terms of the species that compose them but also in terms of the way they interact with each other: for example, species compete for space and for food, eat and facilitate each other. The diversity of ways species interact has rarely been taken into account in the study of ecological communities, although widely acknowledged. Here we show that the diversity of interaction types matters: it affects species diversity, community functioning and the relationship between them by strengthening this relationship. This means that when the diversity of interaction types is taken into account, species losses have stronger impacts on the functioning of ecological communities. Our results therefore suggest that species loss may have more important consequences than expected based on classical models that do not take the diversity of interaction types into account.

"Protection and recovery from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) have been associated with cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses, whereas no protective role has been attributed to humoral responses against specific parasitic antigens. In this report, we compared carefully selected groups of individuals with distinct responses to Leishmania chagasi to explore antigen-recognizing IgG present in resistant individuals.
VL patients with negative delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) were classified into the susceptible group. Individuals who had recovered from VL and converted to a DTH+ response, as well as asymptomatic infected individuals (DTH+), were categorized into the resistant group. Sera from these groups were used to detect antigens from L. chagasi by conventional and 2D Western blot assays. Despite an overall reduction in the reactivity of several proteins after DTH conversion, a specific group of proteins (approximately 110–130 kDa) consistently reacted with sera from DTH converters. Other antigens that specifically reacted with sera from DTH+ individuals were isolated and tandem mass spectrometry followed by database query with the protein search engine MASCO were used to identify antigens. The serological properties of recombinant version of the selected antigens were tested by ELISA. Sera from asymptomatic infected people (DTH+) reacted more strongly with a mixture of selected recombinant antigens than with total soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA), with less cross-reactivity against Chagas disease patients' sera.
Our results are the first evidence of leishmania proteins that are specifically recognized by sera from individuals who are putatively resistant to VL. In addition, these data highlight the possibility of using specific proteins in serological tests for the identification of asymptomatic infected individuals.
","One of the most striking features of infection by Leishmania chagasi is that infection leads to a spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to active disease. The existence of asymptomatic infected people has served as an incentive to believe that an effective vaccine is possible, but unfortunately no successful immunological characterization of such cases was obtained. Patients recovered from visceral leishmaniasis show a similar immunological profile to asymptomatic infected individuals and both exhibit a strong cell-mediated immune response against Leishmania antigens and are resistant to disease. Since the past decade several approaches were undertaken to try to shed light on the immunological profile associated with such “resistance” to infections, notwithstanding antigenic recognition profile associated to resistance to infection was not successfully explored. In the present manuscript we describe a specific IgG recognizing pattern associated with resistant individuals (asymptomatic infected people and recovery patients to visceral leishmaniasis). These data highlight the possibility of using specific proteins in serological tests for the identification of asymptomatic infected individuals.

"RNA interference (RNAi) pathways are widespread in metaozoans but the genes required show variable occurrence or activity in eukaryotic microbes, including many pathogens. While some Leishmania lack RNAi activity and Argonaute or Dicer genes, we show that Leishmania braziliensis and other species within the Leishmania subgenus Viannia elaborate active RNAi machinery. Strong attenuation of expression from a variety of reporter and endogenous genes was seen. As expected, RNAi knockdowns of the sole Argonaute gene implicated this protein in RNAi. The potential for functional genetics was established by testing RNAi knockdown lines lacking the paraflagellar rod, a key component of the parasite flagellum. This sets the stage for the systematic manipulation of gene expression through RNAi in these predominantly diploid asexual organisms, and may also allow selective RNAi-based chemotherapy. Functional evolutionary surveys of RNAi genes established that RNAi activity was lost after the separation of the Leishmania subgenus Viannia from the remaining Leishmania species, a divergence associated with profound changes in the parasite infectious cycle and virulence. The genus Leishmania therefore offers an accessible system for testing hypothesis about forces that may select for the loss of RNAi during evolution, such as invasion by viruses, changes in genome plasticity mediated by transposable elements and gene amplification (including those mediating drug resistance), and/or alterations in parasite virulence.
","RNAi interference pathways play fundamental roles in eukaryotes and provide important methods for the analysis of gene function. Occasionally RNAi has been lost, precluding its use as a tool, as well as raising the question of what forces could lead to loss of such a key pathway. Genomic and functional studies previously showed that within trypanosomatids protozoans RNAi was absent in both Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi. The genome of L. braziliensis, a member of the early diverging Leishmania subgenus Viannia, retained key genes required for RNAi such as an Argonaute. We demonstrated that in fact L. braziliensis shows strong RNAi activity with reporter and endogenous genes affecting flagellar function. These data suggest that RNAi may be productively applied for functional genomic studies in L. braziliensis. We mapped the evolutionary point at which RNAi was lost in lineage leading to Leishmania and Crithidia, and establish that RNAi must have been lost at least twice in the trypanosomatids, once on the lineage leading to T. cruzi and independently following the divergence of the Viannia subgenus from other Leishmania species. Lastly, we discuss hypotheses concerning the forces leading to the loss of RNAi in Leishmania evolution, including viral invasion, increased genome plasticity, and altered virulence.

"Microbial communities are typically large, diverse, and complex, and identifying and understanding the processes driving their structure has implications ranging from ecosystem stability to human health and well-being. Phylogenetic data gives us a new insight into these processes, providing a more informative perspective on functional and trait diversity than taxonomic richness alone. But the sheer scale of high resolution phylogenetic data also presents a new challenge to ecological theory. We bring a sampling theory perspective to microbial communities, considering a local community of co-occuring organisms as a sample from a larger regional pool, and apply our framework to make analytical predictions for local phylogenetic diversity arising from a given metacommunity and community assembly process. We characterize community assembly in terms of quantitative descriptions of clustered, random and overdispersed sampling, which have been associated with hypotheses of environmental filtering and competition. Using our approach, we analyze large microbial communities from the human microbiome, uncovering significant variation in diversity across habitats relative to the null hypothesis of random sampling.
","Microbial diversity analyses have revolutionized our knowledge of the microscopic world, from terrestrial and marine to human and urban environments. This growing field rests on the evolutionary relatedness of organisms, and at its frontier is the inference of ecological processes from phylogenetic diversity. However, the rapidly reducing cost of sequencing means that computational analysis of phylogenetic data is becoming increasingly intractable. We develop a new analytical method to address this issue, providing a computationally-efficient way to compare local phylogenetic diversity to a sample from a regional pool of organisms, under a given ecological process. Our approach has both pragmatic and far-reaching applications. Until now investigators have lacked even an analytical method to compare the diversity of unequally-sized communities without throwing data away, while on a deeper level our theory provides a new framework for connecting phylogenetic data to a wide range of ecological processes. As an application of our approach, we use our methods to distinguish between random, clustered and overdispersed sampling for human microbiome habitats. Finally, we identify a new, phylogenetic analogue of the widely used taxonomic measure of diversity, the Species Abundance Distribution, and we find that it has consistent behavior across microbiome habitats.

"The primitive face is composed of neural crest cell (NCC) derived prominences. The medial nasal processes (MNP) give rise to the upper lip and vomeronasal organ, and are essential for normal craniofacial development, but the mechanism of MNP development remains largely unknown. PDGFRα signaling is known to be critical for NCC development and craniofacial morphogenesis. In this study, we show that PDGFRα is required for MNP development by maintaining the migration of progenitor neural crest cells (NCCs) and the proliferation of MNP cells. Further investigations reveal that PI3K/Akt and Rac1 signaling mediate PDGFRα function during MNP development. We thus establish PDGFRα as a novel regulator of MNP development and elucidate the roles of its downstream signaling pathways at cellular and molecular levels.
","Craniofacial anomalies, including cleft lip and palate, are frequent birth defects. Although these are often associated with defects in neural crest development, the more severe phenotypic manifestations of midline defects is facial clefting, which is poorly understood. In this work, we show that the facial clefting phenotype of PDGFRα mutants is not associated with a defect in neural crest cell specification but rather a subsequent defect in the medial nasal process (MNP), a facial primordium derived from the frontonasal prominence. We further show that this defect is associated with alterations in both cell proliferation and cell migration, and that PI3K and Rac1 signaling are essential to maintain a normal level of cell proliferation. Last, we provide evidence that Rac1 regulates cell migration at the level of cell motility as well as chemotaxis under the regulation of PDGFRα. We thus establish PDGFRα as a novel regulator of MNP development and elucidate the roles of its downstream signaling pathways at cellular and molecular levels.

"The susceptibility of Anopheles mosquitoes to Plasmodium infections relies on complex interactions between the insect vector and the malaria parasite. A number of studies have shown that the mosquito innate immune responses play an important role in controlling the malaria infection and that the strength of parasite clearance is under genetic control, but little is known about the influence of environmental factors on the transmission success. We present here evidence that the composition of the vector gut microbiota is one of the major components that determine the outcome of mosquito infections. A. gambiae mosquitoes collected in natural breeding sites from Cameroon were experimentally challenged with a wild P. falciparum isolate, and their gut bacterial content was submitted for pyrosequencing analysis. The meta-taxogenomic approach revealed a broader richness of the midgut bacterial flora than previously described. Unexpectedly, the majority of bacterial species were found in only a small proportion of mosquitoes, and only 20 genera were shared by 80% of individuals. We show that observed differences in gut bacterial flora of adult mosquitoes is a result of breeding in distinct sites, suggesting that the native aquatic source where larvae were grown determines the composition of the midgut microbiota. Importantly, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in the mosquito midgut correlates significantly with the Plasmodium infection status. This striking relationship highlights the role of natural gut environment in parasite transmission. Deciphering microbe-pathogen interactions offers new perspectives to control disease transmission.
","During their development in the mosquito vector, Plasmodium parasites undergo complex developmental steps and incur severe bottlenecks. The largest parasite losses occur in the mosquito midgut where robust immune responses are activated. Variability in P. falciparum infection levels indicates that parasite transmission is the result of complex interactions between vectors and parasites, which rely on both genetic and environmental factors. However, in contrast to genetically encoded factors, the role of environmental factors in parasite transmission has received little attention. In this study, we characterized the midgut microbiota of mosquitoes derived from diverse breeding sites using pyrosequencing. We show that the composition of the midgut microbiota in adult mosquitoes exhibits great variability, which is likely determined by bacterial richness of the larval habitats. When field mosquitoes were collected at late immature stages in natural breeding sites and the emerging females challenged with Plasmodium falciparum in the laboratory, significant correlation was observed between P. falciparum infection and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae in the mosquito midgut. Greater understanding of these malaria-bacteria interactions may lead to novel malaria control strategies.

"The development of high-throughput biotechnologies allows the collection of omics data to study the biological mechanisms underlying complex diseases at different levels, such as genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. However, each technology is designed to collect a specific type of omics data. Thus, the association between a disease and one type of omics data is usually tested individually, but this strategy is suboptimal. To better articulate biological processes and increase the consistency of variant identification, omics data from various platforms need to be integrated. In this report, we introduce an approach that uses a modified Fisher’s method (denoted as Omnibus-Fisher) to combine separate p-values of association testing for a trait and SNPs, DNA methylation markers, and RNA sequencing, calculated by kernel machine regression into an overall gene-level p-value to account for correlation between omics data. To consider all possible disease models, we extend Omnibus-Fisher to an optimal test by using perturbations. In our simulations, a usual Fisher’s method has inflated type I error rates when directly applied to correlated omics data. In contrast, Omnibus-Fisher preserves the expected type I error rates. Moreover, Omnibus-Fisher has increased power compared to its optimal version when the true disease model involves all types of omics data. On the other hand, the optimal Omnibus-Fisher is more powerful than its regular version when only one type of data is causal. Finally, we illustrate our proposed method by analyzing whole-genome genotyping, DNA methylation data, and RNA sequencing data from a study of childhood asthma in Puerto Ricans.

"To investigate the DDT and deltamethrin susceptibility of Phlebotomus argentipes, the vector of Leishmania donovani, responsible for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), in two countries (India and Nepal) with different histories of insecticide exposure.
Standard WHO testing procedures were applied using 4% DDT and 0.05% deltamethrin impregnated papers. The effect of the physiological status (fed and unfed) of females on the outcome of the bioassays was assessed and the optimal time of exposure for deltamethrin was evaluated on a colony population. Field populations from both countries were tested.
Fed and unfed females responded in a similar way. For exposure time on field samples 60 min was adopted for both DDT and deltamethrin. In Bihar, knockdown and mortality with DDT was respectively 20 and 43%. In Nepal almost all sand flies were killed, except at the border with Bihar (mortality 62%). With 0.05% deltamethrin, between 96 and 100% of the sand flies were killed in both regions.
Based on literature and present data 4% DDT and 0.05% deltamethrin seem to be acceptable discriminating concentrations to separate resistant from susceptible populations. Resistance to DDT was confirmed in Bihar and in a border village of Nepal, but the sand flies were still susceptible in villages more inside Nepal where only synthetic pyrethroids are used for indoor spraying. The low effectiveness of indoor spraying with DDT in Bihar to control VL can be partially explained by this resistance hence other classes of insecticides should be tested. In both countries P. argentipes sand flies were susceptible to deltamethrin.
","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also know as kala azar, is one of the major public health concerns India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In the Indian subcontinent, VL is caused by Leishmania donovani which is transmitted by Phlebotomus argentipes. To date, Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) campaigns have been unable to control the disease. Vector resistance to the insecticides used has been postulated as one of the possible reasons explaining this failure. A number of studies in the region have shown a variable degree of resistance to DDT in areas where this insecticide has been widely used for IRS (mainly India). However there is no coordinated and standardized program to monitor resistance to insecticides in the region. In this study we tested P. argentipes susceptibility to DDT and deltamethrin in VL endemic villages in India and Nepal. The results confirmed the DDT resistance in India and in a border village of Nepal. P. argentipes from both countries were in general susceptible to deltamethrin, an insecticide used in some long lasting insecticidal nets.

"African Americans have a disproportionate risk for developing nephropathy. This disparity has been attributed to coding variants (G1 and G2) in apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1); however, there is little functional evidence supporting the role of this protein in renal function. Here, we combined genetics and in vivo modeling to examine the role of apol1 in glomerular development and pronephric filtration and to test the pathogenic potential of APOL1 G1 and G2. Translational suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of apol1 in zebrafish embryos results in podocyte loss and glomerular filtration defects. Complementation of apol1 morphants with wild-type human APOL1 mRNA rescues these defects. However, the APOL1 G1 risk allele does not ameliorate defects caused by apol1 suppression and the pathogenicity is conferred by the cis effect of both individual variants of the G1 risk haplotype (I384M/S342G). In vivo complementation studies of the G2 risk allele also indicate that the variant is deleterious to protein function. Moreover, APOL1 G2, but not G1, expression alone promotes developmental kidney defects, suggesting a possible dominant-negative effect of the altered protein. In sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, we reported previously a genetic interaction between APOL1 and MYH9. Testing this interaction in vivo by co-suppressing both transcripts yielded no additive effects. However, upon genetic or chemical induction of anemia, we observed a significantly exacerbated nephropathy phenotype. Furthermore, concordant with the genetic interaction observed in SCD patients, APOL1 G2 reduces myh9 expression in vivo, suggesting a possible interaction between the altered APOL1 and myh9. Our data indicate a critical role for APOL1 in renal function that is compromised by nephropathy-risk encoding variants. Moreover, our interaction studies indicate that the MYH9 locus is also relevant to the phenotype in a stressed microenvironment and suggest that consideration of the context-dependent functions of both proteins will be required to develop therapeutic paradigms.
","African Americans have a disproportionate risk for developing chronic kidney disease compared to European Americans. Previous studies have identified a region on chromosome 22 containing two genes, MYH9 and APOL1, which likely accounts for nearly all of this difference. Previous reports provided strong statistical evidence implicating APOL1 as the major contributor to nephropathy risk in African Americans, driven by two coding variants, termed G1 and G2. However, other groups still report statistical evidence for MYH9 association in kidney disease, and animal models have demonstrated biological relevance for MYH9 function in the kidney. Here, we show that suppressing apol1 in zebrafish embryos results in perturbed kidney function. Importantly, using this in vivo assay, we show that the G1 variant appears to cause a loss of APOL1 function, while the G2 variant results in an altered protein that may be acting antagonistically in the presence of normal APOL1. We also report a genetic interaction between apol1 and myh9 under anemic stress, which is consistent with our previous findings in sickle cell disease (SCD) nephropathy patients. Finally, we provide functional evidence in vivo that the G2-altered APOL1 may be interacting with MYH9 to confer nephropathy risk.

"What is the underlying mechanism behind the fat-tailed statistics observed for species abundance distributions? The two main hypotheses in the field are the adaptive (niche) theories, where species abundance reflects its fitness, and the neutral theory that assumes demographic stochasticity as the main factor determining community structure. Both explanations suggest quite similar species-abundance distributions, but very different histories: niche scenarios assume that a species population in the past was similar to the observed one, while neutral scenarios are characterized by strongly fluctuating populations. Since the genetic variations within a population depend on its abundance in the past, we present here a way to discriminate between the theories using the genetic diversity of noncoding DNA. A statistical test, based on the Fu-Li method, has been developed and enables such a differentiation. We have analyzed the results gathered from individual-based simulation of both types of histories and obtained clear distinction between the Fu-Li statistics of the neutral scenario and that of the niche scenario. Our results suggest that data for 10–50 species, with approximately 30 sequenced individuals for each species, may allow one to distinguish between these two theories.
","One purchases 100 wineglasses and 100 pairs of pants. After one year, 10 glasses and 10 pants survive. What can be said about the relative quality of the survivors? Well, clothes “die” as a result of accumulated wear; the surviving items are of better quality. The breaking of a wineglass is an external, random event: here the survivors are not the best, but the luckiest. To tell apart the superior from the fortunate, one should examine the development over time: the number of surviving items decays exponentially with time for the glasses and follows a sigmoid curve for the pants. An ongoing argument among macroecologists deals with similar issues. Adaptive theories suggest that the frequent species are the fittest, while the neutral theory explains the observed frequencies as a result of demographic stochasticity, assuming all species to have the same fitness. The histories suggested by the two scenarios are clearly different, but how can one probe the prehistoric abundance of species? In fact, past abundance is reflected in current genetic variance within a population. Here, we present a new technique, based on the Fu-Li F-statistic, which allows one to distinguish between niche and neutral scenarios and to resolve this important debate.

"The London Declaration on neglected tropical diseases was based in part on a new World Health Organization roadmap to “sustain, expand and extend drug access programmes to ensure the necessary supply of drugs and other interventions to help control by 2020”. Large drug donations from the pharmaceutical industry form the backbone to this aim, especially for soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) raising the question of how best to use these resources. Deworming for STHs is often targeted at school children because they are at greatest risk of morbidity and because it is remarkably cost-effective. However, the impact of school-based deworming on transmission in the wider community remains unclear.
We first estimate the proportion of parasites targeted by school-based deworming using demography, school enrolment, and data from a small number of example settings where age-specific intensity of infection (either worms or eggs) has been measured for all ages. We also use transmission models to investigate the potential impact of this coverage on transmission for different mixing scenarios.
In the example settings <30% of the population are 5 to <15 years old. Combining this demography with the infection age-intensity profile we estimate that in one setting school children output as little as 15% of hookworm eggs, whereas in another setting they harbour up to 50% of Ascaris lumbricoides worms (the highest proportion of parasites for our examples). In addition, it is estimated that from 40–70% of these children are enrolled at school.
These estimates suggest that, whilst school-based programmes have many important benefits, the proportion of infective stages targeted by school-based deworming may be limited, particularly where hookworm predominates. We discuss the consequences for transmission for a range of scenarios, including when infective stages deposited by children are more likely to contribute to transmission than those from adults.
","Large donations of drugs to treat soil-transmitted helminths (STHs, intestinal worms) means that many more school-aged children will be treated, improving their well-being and development. These children will have to be repeatedly treated since reinfection will occur due to contaminated environments in the absence of improvements in hygiene and sanitation. Repeated treatment of school-aged children may have the added benefit of reductions in levels of infection for the whole community. This will in part be determined by the proportion of the total worms harboured or eggs output by school-aged children, a product of how heavily infected school-aged children are and how many school-aged children there are in the community. In one setting school-aged children output as little as 15% of hookworm eggs whereas in another setting they harbour up to 50% of roundworms. Thus, whilst school-based programmes may have important health benefits, the community-level impact on transmission could be limited unless school-aged children over-contribute to infection. We use mathematical models to show that if children contribute more infective stages to the environment which adults are exposed to than adults do, the reductions in transmission resulting from treating children will be larger, but may still be limited.

"The role of biofilms in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial diseases remains largely unknown. Mycobacterium ulcerans, the etiological agent of Buruli ulcer, a disfiguring disease in humans, adopts a biofilm-like structure in vitro and in vivo, displaying an abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) that harbors vesicles. The composition and structure of the ECM differs from that of the classical matrix found in other bacterial biofilms. More than 80 proteins are present within this extracellular compartment and appear to be involved in stress responses, respiration, and intermediary metabolism. In addition to a large amount of carbohydrates and lipids, ECM is the reservoir of the polyketide toxin mycolactone, the sole virulence factor of M. ulcerans identified to date, and purified vesicles extracted from ECM are highly cytotoxic. ECM confers to the mycobacterium increased resistance to antimicrobial agents, and enhances colonization of insect vectors and mammalian hosts. The results of this study support a model whereby biofilm changes confer selective advantages to M. ulcerans in colonizing various ecological niches successfully, with repercussions for Buruli ulcer pathogenesis.
","Mycobacterium ulcerans is the etiologic agent of Buruli ulcer, a necrotic skin disease affecting humans living close to wetlands in tropical countries. This mycobacteria resides in water where it could colonize many ecological niches such as aquatic plants, herbivorous animals, and water bugs. The latter were shown to be able to transmit the bacteria to mammalian hosts. Here, we described that the bacilli could be structured with a thick envelope called the extracellular matrix (ECM). This peculiar coat contains in small vesicles a toxin named mycolactone, the main virulence factor of M. ulcerans. The ECM confers to the mycobacterium increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and plays a role in virulence. Indeed, a bacteria with ECM is more potent for colonization of insect vectors and mammalian hosts compared to bacteria. Unraveling the regulation of the production of the ECM together with the export of mycolactone will be an important step in developing new pharmacological approaches for the treatment of Buruli ulcer, which has been greatly handicapped by the lack of effectiveness of the current antibiotics.

"Adenoviral replication depends on viral as well as cellular proteins. However, little is known about cellular proteins promoting adenoviral replication. In our screens to identify such proteins, we discovered a cellular component of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway interacting with the central regulator of adenoviral replication. Our binding assays mapped a specific interaction between the N-terminal domains of both viral E1B-55K and USP7, a deubiquitinating enzyme. RNA interference-mediated downregulation of USP7 severely reduced E1B-55K protein levels, but more importantly negatively affected adenoviral replication. We also succeeded in resynthesizing an inhibitor of USP7, which like the knockdown background reduced adenoviral replication. Further assays revealed that not only adenoviral growth, but also adenoviral oncogene-driven cellular transformation relies on the functions of USP7. Our data provide insights into an intricate mechanistic pathway usurped by an adenovirus to promote its replication and oncogenic functions, and at the same time open up possibilities for new antiviral strategies.
","Adenoviral infections can result in severe outcomes leading to mortality especially in children undergoing immunosuppressive therapies. Unfortunately, no specific anti-adenoviral treatments are available to treat disseminated adenoviral infections. We have set out to identify host factors promoting adenoviral growth and could identify the cellular protein Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) being central to adenoviral infection. Here we show that USP7 interacts with the viral protein E1B-55K, a central regulator of adenoviral replication and adenoviral oncogene-mediated cellular transformation. We demonstrate that USP7 ensures stability and/or proper expression levels of adenoviral proteins at early and late time points of infection. Consistent with this, small-molecule inhibitors of USP7 showed efficient reduction of capsid protein levels and viral progeny numbers. Thus, USP7 inhibition might be a useful treatment option in the context of disseminated adenoviral infections. Moreover, we were also able to show that adenoviral oncogene-mediated cellular transformation can be hampered by USP7 disruption. In summary, this study shows that two different adenoviral disease mechanisms can be inhibited by targeting one host cellular factor.

"Bang sensitive (BS) Drosophila mutants display characteristic seizure-like phenotypes resembling, in some aspects, those of human seizure disorders such as epilepsy. The BS mutant parabss1, caused by a gain-of-function mutation of the voltage-gated Na+ channel gene, is extremely seizure-sensitive with phenotypes that have proven difficult to ameliorate by anti-epileptic drug feeding or by seizure-suppressor mutation. It has been presented as a model for intractable human epilepsy. Here we show that cacophony (cacTS2), a mutation of the Drosophila presynaptic Ca++ channel α1 subunit gene, is a particularly potent seizure-suppressor mutation, reverting seizure-like phenotypes for parabss1 and other BS mutants. Seizure-like phenotypes for parabss1 may be suppressed by as much as 90% in double mutant combinations with cacTS2. Unexpectedly, we find that parabss1 also reciprocally suppresses cacTS2 seizure-like phenotypes. The cacTS2 mutant displays these seizure-like behaviors and spontaneous high-frequency action potential firing transiently after exposure to high temperature. We find that this seizure-like behavior in cacTS2 is ameliorated by 85% in double mutant combinations with parabss1.
","Seizure disorders, such as epilepsy, are a serious health concern because of the large number of patients affected and a limited availability of treatment options. About 10% of the population will have at least one seizure during their lifetime, and 1% will experience persistent, recurrent epileptic seizures. Moreover, for about one-third of patients, epilepsy is intractable with seizures that are not controlled with any available drugs. Genetic seizure suppressors are modifier mutations that are capable of reverting seizure susceptibility to wild type levels when combined with seizure-prone mutants in double mutant individuals. Suppressors are valuable in providing an experimental approach that can provide insight into mechanisms underlying seizure susceptibility. Also, they identify novel gene products that may be targets for therapeutic drug development. In the present study we show that a severe seizure phenotype of the Drosophila paralyticbss1 (parabss1) mutant is 90% suppressed by the N-type calcium channel mutation cacophonyTS2 (cacTS2). The effect of suppression is not restricted to parabss1, but cacTS2 can also revert seizure-like phenotypes of other Drosophila mutants like easily-shocked (eas) and slamdance (sda). Thus, cacTS2 acts as a highly potent, general seizure suppressor mutation. A surprising finding in this study is co-suppression: parabss1 also suppresses a seizure phenotype in cacTS2 mutants induced by elevated temperature. A current view of complex diseases such as epilepsy, is that multiple genes and environmental factors can each contribute small, additive effects that can summate to produce a disease state when some threshold value is exceeded. Our findings indicate that different pathogenic ion channel mutations can sometimes form therapeutic combinations with effects that mask one another.

"Echinoderms, which are phylogenetically related to vertebrates and produce large numbers of transparent embryos that can be experimentally manipulated, offer many advantages for the analysis of the gene regulatory networks (GRN) regulating germ layer formation. During development of the sea urchin embryo, the ectoderm is the source of signals that pattern all three germ layers along the dorsal-ventral axis. How this signaling center controls patterning and morphogenesis of the embryo is not understood. Here, we report a large-scale analysis of the GRN deployed in response to the activity of this signaling center in the embryos of the Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, in which studies with high spatial resolution are possible. By using a combination of in situ hybridization screening, overexpression of mRNA, recombinant ligand treatments, and morpholino-based loss-of-function studies, we identified a cohort of transcription factors and signaling molecules expressed in the ventral ectoderm, dorsal ectoderm, and interposed neurogenic (“ciliary band”) region in response to the known key signaling molecules Nodal and BMP2/4 and defined the epistatic relationships between the most important genes. The resultant GRN showed a number of striking features. First, Nodal was found to be essential for the expression of all ventral and dorsal marker genes, and BMP2/4 for all dorsal genes. Second, goosecoid was identified as a central player in a regulatory sub-circuit controlling mouth formation, while tbx2/3 emerged as a critical factor for differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm. Finally, and unexpectedly, a neurogenic ectoderm regulatory circuit characterized by expression of “ciliary band” genes was triggered in the absence of TGF beta signaling. We propose a novel model for ectoderm regionalization, in which neural ectoderm is the default fate in the absence of TGF beta signaling, and suggest that the stomodeal and neural subcircuits that we uncovered may represent ancient regulatory pathways controlling embryonic patterning.
","Echinoderms (sea urchins, starfish, etc.) are marine invertebrates that share a close ancestry with vertebrates. Their embryos offer many advantages for the analysis of transcriptional circuits that control developmental programs. During early development of the common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a signaling center located within the ventral ectoderm sends two key signals, Nodal and BMP2/4, that control patterning of the embryo along the whole dorsal-ventral axis. How this signaling center works is not understood. We have conducted a large-scale functional analysis of the genes responsible for patterning of the ectoderm along the dorsal-ventral axis. We identified direct targets of Nodal and BMP2/4 and identified several key regulators that mediate the effects of these factors and drive essential and probably ancient regulatory circuits that together constitute a transcriptional program controlling morphogenesis of the embryo. In addition, we uncovered a striking parallel between the mouse embryo and the sea urchin embryo by showing that in both models a neurogenic ectoderm is the default state of ectoderm differentiation in the absence of Nodal and BMP signaling. Our results support the idea that inhibition of Nodal and BMP signaling was probably an ancient mechanism to specify neural cells in the ancestor of vertebrates.

"Genetic variation within and between species can be shaped by population-level processes and mutation; however, the relative impact of “survival of the fittest” and “arrival of the fittest” on phenotypic evolution remains unclear. Assessing the influence of mutation on evolution requires understanding the relative rates of different types of mutations and their genetic properties, yet little is known about the functional consequences of new mutations. Here, we examine the spectrum of mutations affecting a focal gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by characterizing 231 novel haploid genotypes with altered activity of a fluorescent reporter gene. 7% of these genotypes had a nonsynonymous mutation in the coding sequence for the fluorescent protein and were classified as “coding” mutants; 2% had a change in the S. cerevisiae TDH3 promoter sequence controlling expression of the fluorescent protein and were classified as “cis-regulatory” mutants; 10% contained two copies of the reporter gene and were classified as “copy number” mutants; and the remaining 81% showed altered fluorescence without a change in the reporter gene itself and were classified as “trans-acting” mutants. As a group, coding mutants had the strongest effect on reporter gene activity and always decreased it. By contrast, 50%–95% of the mutants in each of the other three classes increased gene activity, with mutants affecting copy number and cis-regulatory sequences having larger median effects on gene activity than trans-acting mutants. When made heterozygous in diploid cells, coding, cis-regulatory, and copy number mutant genotypes all had significant effects on gene activity, whereas 88% of the trans-acting mutants appeared to be recessive. These differences in the frequency, effects, and dominance among functional classes of mutations might help explain why some types of mutations are found to be segregating within or fixed between species more often than others.
","Genetic dissection of phenotypic differences within and between species has shown that mutations affecting either the expression or function of a gene product can contribute to phenotypic evolution; mutations that alter gene copy number have also been shown to be an important source of phenotypic variation. Predicting when and why one type of mutation is more likely to underlie a phenotypic change than another remains a pressing challenge for evolution biology. Understanding the relative frequency and properties of different types of mutations will help resolve this issue. To this end, we isolated 231 mutants with altered activity of a focal gene. Mutants were classified into one of four functional classes (i.e., coding, cis-regulatory, trans-acting, or copy number) based on the location and nature of mutation(s), or lack thereof, within the focal gene. Mutant effects on focal gene activity were assessed in both haploid and diploid cells. These data identified differences in the frequency, effects, and dominance (relative to the wild-type allele) among functional classes of mutants that help explain patterns of genetic variation within and between species.

"Mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum ‘chloroquine resistance transporter’ (PfCRT) confer resistance to chloroquine (CQ) and related antimalarials by enabling the protein to transport these drugs away from their targets within the parasite’s digestive vacuole (DV). However, CQ resistance-conferring isoforms of PfCRT (PfCRTCQR) also render the parasite hypersensitive to a subset of structurally-diverse pharmacons. Moreover, mutations in PfCRTCQR that suppress the parasite’s hypersensitivity to these molecules simultaneously reinstate its sensitivity to CQ and related drugs. We sought to understand these phenomena by characterizing the functions of PfCRTCQR isoforms that cause the parasite to become hypersensitive to the antimalarial quinine or the antiviral amantadine. We achieved this by measuring the abilities of these proteins to transport CQ, quinine, and amantadine when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and complemented this work with assays that detect the drug transport activity of PfCRT in its native environment within the parasite. Here we describe two mechanistic explanations for PfCRT-induced drug hypersensitivity. First, we show that quinine, which normally accumulates inside the DV and therewithin exerts its antimalarial effect, binds extremely tightly to the substrate-binding site of certain isoforms of PfCRTCQR. By doing so it likely blocks the normal physiological function of the protein, which is essential for the parasite’s survival, and the drug thereby gains an additional killing effect. In the second scenario, we show that although amantadine also sequesters within the DV, the parasite’s hypersensitivity to this drug arises from the PfCRTCQR-mediated transport of amantadine from the DV into the cytosol, where it can better access its antimalarial target. In both cases, the mutations that suppress hypersensitivity also abrogate the ability of PfCRTCQR to transport CQ, thus explaining why rescue from hypersensitivity restores the parasite’s sensitivity to this antimalarial. These insights provide a foundation for understanding clinically-relevant observations of inverse drug susceptibilities in the malaria parasite.
","In acquiring resistance to one drug, many pathogens and cancer cells become hypersensitive to other drugs. This phenomenon could be exploited to combat existing drug resistance and to delay the emergence of resistance to new drugs. However, much remains to be understood about the mechanisms that underlie drug hypersensitivity in otherwise drug-resistant microbes. Here, we describe two mechanisms by which the Plasmodium falciparum ‘chloroquine resistance transporter’ (PfCRT) causes the malaria parasite to become hypersensitive to structurally-diverse drugs. First, we show that an antimalarial drug that normally exerts its killing effect within the parasite’s digestive vacuole is also able to bind extremely tightly to certain forms of PfCRT. This activity will block the natural, essential function of the protein and thereby provide the drug with an additional killing effect. The second mechanism arises when a cytosolic-acting drug that normally sequesters within the digestive vacuole is leaked back into the cytosol via PfCRT. In both cases, mutations that suppress hypersensitivity also abrogate the ability of PfCRT to transport chloroquine, thus explaining why rescue from hypersensitivity restores the parasite’s sensitivity to this antimalarial. These insights provide a foundation for understanding and exploiting the hypersensitivity of chloroquine-resistant parasites to several of the current antimalarials.

"Exogenous CD1d-binding glycolipid (α-Galactosylceramide, α-GC) stimulates TCR signaling and activation of type-1 natural killer–like T (NKT) cells. Activated NKT cells play a central role in the regulation of adaptive and protective immune responses against pathogens and tumors. In the present study, we tested the effect of Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LT) on NKT cells both in vivo and in vitro. LT is a binary toxin known to suppress host immune responses during anthrax disease and intoxicates cells by protective antigen (PA)-mediated intracellular delivery of lethal factor (LF), a potent metalloprotease. We observed that NKT cells expressed anthrax toxin receptors (CMG-2 and TEM-8) and bound more PA than other immune cell types. A sub-lethal dose of LT administered in vivo in C57BL/6 mice decreased expression of the activation receptor NKG2D by NKT cells but not by NK cells. The in vivo administration of LT led to decreased TCR-induced cytokine secretion but did not affect TCR expression. Further analysis revealed LT-dependent inhibition of TCR-stimulated MAP kinase signaling in NKT cells attributable to LT cleavage of the MAP kinase kinase MEK-2. We propose that Bacillus anthracis–derived LT causes a novel form of functional anergy in NKT cells and therefore has potential for contributing to immune evasion by the pathogen.
","The bacterium Bacillus anthracis is the causative agent of anthrax infection. Anthrax is a life-threatening disease caused by inhalation or ingestion of spores, or transmission through wounds and abrasions. The bacterium secretes toxins, proteins that enter numerous cell types in an infected individual altering their function and contributing to the disease process. Consequently, we and other researchers are dedicated to identifying cells affected by anthrax toxins and to understanding the implications for the function of those cells. We have observed that anthrax toxins adversely affect a type of cell in the immune system known as a natural killer–like T (NKT) cell. NKT cells are found in the bone marrow, blood, spleen, lymph nodes and liver and are required for optimal immune responses. We report that anthrax toxins effectively shut down NKT cells, preventing them from functioning normally. We propose that this has serious consequences because anyone infected with Bacillus anthracis will be less able to mount an immune response against it.

"Do the frequencies of disease mutations in human populations reflect a simple balance between mutation and purifying selection? What other factors shape the prevalence of disease mutations? To begin to answer these questions, we focused on one of the simplest cases: recessive mutations that alone cause lethal diseases or complete sterility. To this end, we generated a hand-curated set of 417 Mendelian mutations in 32 genes reported to cause a recessive, lethal Mendelian disease. We then considered analytic models of mutation-selection balance in infinite and finite populations of constant sizes and simulations of purifying selection in a more realistic demographic setting, and tested how well these models fit allele frequencies estimated from 33,370 individuals of European ancestry. In doing so, we distinguished between CpG transitions, which occur at a substantially elevated rate, and three other mutation types. Intriguingly, the observed frequency for CpG transitions is slightly higher than expectation but close, whereas the frequencies observed for the three other mutation types are an order of magnitude higher than expected, with a bigger deviation from expectation seen for less mutable types. This discrepancy is even larger when subtle fitness effects in heterozygotes or lethal compound heterozygotes are taken into account. In principle, higher than expected frequencies of disease mutations could be due to widespread errors in reporting causal variants, compensation by other mutations, or balancing selection. It is unclear why these factors would have a greater impact on disease mutations that occur at lower rates, however. We argue instead that the unexpectedly high frequency of disease mutations and the relationship to the mutation rate likely reflect an ascertainment bias: of all the mutations that cause recessive lethal diseases, those that by chance have reached higher frequencies are more likely to have been identified and thus to have been included in this study. Beyond the specific application, this study highlights the parameters likely to be important in shaping the frequencies of Mendelian disease alleles.
","What determines the frequencies of disease mutations in human populations? To begin to answer this question, we focus on one of the simplest cases: mutations that cause completely recessive, lethal Mendelian diseases. We first review theory about what to expect from mutation and selection in a population of finite size and generate predictions based on simulations using a plausible demographic scenario of recent human evolution. For a highly mutable type of mutation, transitions at CpG sites, we find that the predictions are close to the observed frequencies of recessive lethal disease mutations. For less mutable types, however, predictions substantially under-estimate the observed frequency. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy and point to a complication that, to our knowledge, is not widely appreciated: that there exists ascertainment bias in disease mutation discovery. Specifically, we suggest that alleles that have been identified to date are likely the ones that by chance have reached higher frequencies and are thus more likely to have been mapped. More generally, our study highlights the factors that influence the frequencies of Mendelian disease alleles.

"The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates diverse cellular activities related to cell growth, migration, survival, and vesicular trafficking. It is known that Ebola virus requires endocytosis to establish an infection. However, the cellular signals that mediate this uptake were unknown for Ebola virus as well as many other viruses. Here, the involvement of PI3K in Ebola virus entry was studied. A novel and critical role of the PI3K signaling pathway was demonstrated in cell entry of Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV). Inhibitors of PI3K and Akt significantly reduced infection by ZEBOV at an early step during the replication cycle. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt-1 was induced shortly after exposure of cells to radiation-inactivated ZEBOV, indicating that the virus actively induces the PI3K pathway and that replication was not required for this induction. Subsequent use of pseudotyped Ebola virus and/or Ebola virus-like particles, in a novel virus entry assay, provided evidence that activity of PI3K/Akt is required at the virus entry step. Class 1A PI3Ks appear to play a predominant role in regulating ZEBOV entry, and Rac1 is a key downstream effector in this regulatory cascade. Confocal imaging of fluorescently labeled ZEBOV indicated that inhibition of PI3K, Akt, or Rac1 disrupted normal uptake of virus particles into cells and resulted in aberrant accumulation of virus into a cytosolic compartment that was non-permissive for membrane fusion. We conclude that PI3K-mediated signaling plays an important role in regulating vesicular trafficking of ZEBOV necessary for cell entry. Disruption of this signaling leads to inappropriate trafficking within the cell and a block in steps leading to membrane fusion. These findings extend our current understanding of Ebola virus entry mechanism and may help in devising useful new strategies for treatment of Ebola virus infection.
","Each year, filoviruses such as Ebola virus claim many human lives and decimate gorilla populations in Africa. Infection results in an acute fever often associated with profuse internal and external bleeding and death rates of up to 90%. Due to these symptoms and high pathogenicity, these viruses have been heavily publicized in the media. The first step of infection is entry, where the virus is taken up and penetrates into the cell, from which it spreads throughout the body. While it is known that the cell must engulf the virus by the process of endocytosis, we know little about how the virus triggers this event. Here, we use a novel technology to measure penetration of Ebola virus into the cell in real time and show that Ebola virus stimulates phosphoinositide-3 kinase, a signaling molecule known to induce endocytosis. Importantly, drugs that interfere with this signaling inhibit infection by Ebola virus and block virus spread. This work provides a mechanistic insight into how Ebola virus manipulates the cell to start an infection, may explain part of virus induced pathogenesis, and provides a potential way to treat this deadly disease.

"Oncomelania hupensis is the unique intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, which causes schistosomiasis endemic in the Far East, and especially in mainland China. O. hupensis largely determines the parasite's geographical range. How O. hupensis's genetic diversity is distributed geographically in mainland China has never been well examined with DNA sequence data.
In this study we investigate the genetic variation among O. hupensis from different geographical origins using the combined complete internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and ITS2 regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. 165 O. hupensis isolates were obtained in 29 localities from 7 provinces across mainland China: lake/marshland and hill regions in Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Jiangsu provinces, located along the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, and mountainous regions in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses showed distinct genetic diversity and no shared haplotypes between populations from lake/marshland regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and populations from mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The genetic distance between these two groups is up to 0.81 based on Fst, and branch time was estimated as 2–6 Ma. As revealed in the phylogenetic tree, snails from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces were also clustered separately. Geographical separation appears to be an important factor accounting for the diversification of the two groups of O. hupensis in mainland China, and probably for the separate clades between snails from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. In lake/marshland and hill regions along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, three clades were identified in the phylogenetic tree, but without any obvious clustering of snails from different provinces.
O. hupensis in mainland China may have considerable genetic diversity, and a more complex population structure than expected. It will be of significant importance to consider the genetic diversity of O. hupensis when assessing co-evolutionary interactions with S. japonicum.
","The intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum in Asia is the snail Oncomelania hupensis, which can be separated phenotypically into ribbed- and smooth-shelled morphotypes. In China, the typical morphotype is ribbed-shelled, with its distribution restricted to mainland China. Smooth-shelled snails with varix are also distributed in China, which are considered to belong to the same subspecies as the ribbed-shelled snails. In this study we investigate the genetic variation among O. hupensis from different geographical origins using combined complete ITS1 and ITS2 regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Snails including ribbed-shelled and smooth-shelled (but with varix on the shell) from the lake/marshland region of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and smooth-shelled snails from mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, were genetically distinct with no shared haplotypes detected. Furtheremore, the snails from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces were clustered in separate clades in the phylogenetic tree, and three clades were observed for snails from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The population diversity of O. hupensis in China is thus considered large, and evolutionary relationships in the host-parasite system of O. hupensis-S. japonicum may be of interest for further research.

"Exposure to man-made electromagnetic fields (EMFs), which increasingly pollute our environment, have consequences for human health about which there is continuing ignorance and debate. Whereas there is considerable ongoing concern about their harmful effects, magnetic fields are at the same time being applied as therapeutic tools in regenerative medicine, oncology, orthopedics, and neurology. This paradox cannot be resolved until the cellular mechanisms underlying such effects are identified. Here, we show by biochemical and imaging experiments that exposure of mammalian cells to weak pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) stimulates rapid accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a potentially toxic metabolite with multiple roles in stress response and cellular ageing. Following exposure to PEMF, cell growth is slowed, and ROS-responsive genes are induced. These effects require the presence of cryptochrome, a putative magnetosensor that synthesizes ROS. We conclude that modulation of intracellular ROS via cryptochromes represents a general response to weak EMFs, which can account for either therapeutic or pathological effects depending on exposure. Clinically, our findings provide a rationale to optimize low field magnetic stimulation for novel therapeutic applications while warning against the possibility of harmful synergistic effects with environmental agents that further increase intracellular ROS.
","Repetitive low-intensity magnetic stimulation has been used in the treatment of disease for over 50 years. Associated benefits have included alleviation of depression, memory loss, and symptoms of Parkinson disease, as well as accelerated bone and wound healing and the treatment of certain cancers, independently of surgery or drugs. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that repetitive magnetic field exposure in human cells stimulates production of biological stress response chemicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). At moderate doses, we find that reactive oxygen actively stimulates cellular repair and stress response pathways, which might account for the observed therapeutic effects to repetitive magnetic stimulation. We further show that this response requires the function of a well-characterized, evolutionarily conserved flavoprotein receptor known as cryptochrome, which has been implicated in magnetic sensing in organisms ranging from plants to flies, including migratory birds. We conclude that exposure to weak magnetic fields induces the production of ROS in human cells and that this process requires the presence of the cryptochrome receptor.

"Microbial populations founded by a single clone and propagated under resource limitation can become polymorphic. We sought to elucidate genetic mechanisms whereby a polymorphism evolved in Escherichia coli under glucose limitation and persisted because of cross-feeding among multiple adaptive clones. Apart from a 29 kb deletion in the dominant clone, no large-scale genomic changes distinguished evolved clones from their common ancestor. Using transcriptional profiling on co-evolved clones cultured separately under glucose-limitation we identified 180 genes significantly altered in expression relative to the common ancestor grown under similar conditions. Ninety of these were similarly expressed in all clones, and many of the genes affected (e.g., mglBAC, mglD, and lamB) are in operons coordinately regulated by CRP and/or rpoS. While the remaining significant expression differences were clone-specific, 93% were exhibited by the majority clone, many of which are controlled by global regulators, CRP and CpxR. When transcriptional profiling was performed on adaptive clones cultured together, many expression differences that distinguished the majority clone cultured in isolation were absent, suggesting that CpxR may be activated by overflow metabolites removed by cross-feeding strains in co-culture. Relative to their common ancestor, shared expression differences among adaptive clones were partly attributable to early-arising shared mutations in the trans-acting global regulator, rpoS, and the cis-acting regulator, mglO. Gene expression differences that distinguished clones may in part be explained by mutations in trans-acting regulators malT and glpK, and in cis-acting sequences of acs. In the founder, a cis-regulatory mutation in acs (acetyl CoA synthetase) and a structural mutation in glpR (glycerol-3-phosphate repressor) likely favored evolution of specialists that thrive on overflow metabolites. Later-arising mutations that led to specialization emphasize the importance of compensatory rather than gain-of-function mutations in this system. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of regulatory change, founder genotype, and the biotic environment in the adaptive evolution of microbes.
","Experimental evolution of asexual species has shown that multiple genotypes can arise from a single ancestor and stably coexist (e unibus plurum). Although facilitated by environmental heterogeneity, this phenomenon also occurs in simple, homogeneous environments provisioned with a single limiting nutrient. We sought to discover genetic mechanisms that enabled an E. coli population founded by a single clone to become an interacting community composed of multiple clones. The founder of this population contained mutations that impair regulation of acetate and glycerol metabolism and likely favored the evolution of cross-feeding. Adaptive clones share cis- and trans-regulatory mutations shown elsewhere to enhance fitness under glucose limitation. Certain mutations that distinguish adaptive clones and underlie evolution of specialists were compensatory rather than gain-of-function, and all that we detected resulted in gene expression changes rather than protein structure changes. Evolved clones exhibited both common and clone-specific gene expression changes relative to their common ancestor; the pattern of gene expression in the dominant clone cultured alone differed from the pattern observed when it was cultured with variants feeding on its overflow metabolites. These findings illuminate the roles played by founder genotype, differential gene regulation, and the biotic environment in the adaptive evolution of bacteria.

"The process of assigning a finite set of tags or labels to a collection of observations, subject to side conditions, is notable for its computational complexity. This labeling paradigm is of theoretical and practical relevance to a wide range of biological applications, including the analysis of data from DNA microarrays, metabolomics experiments, and biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We present a novel algorithm, called Probabilistic Interaction Network of Evidence (PINE), that achieves robust, unsupervised probabilistic labeling of data. The computational core of PINE uses estimates of evidence derived from empirical distributions of previously observed data, along with consistency measures, to drive a fictitious system M with Hamiltonian H to a quasi-stationary state that produces probabilistic label assignments for relevant subsets of the data. We demonstrate the successful application of PINE to a key task in protein NMR spectroscopy: that of converting peak lists extracted from various NMR experiments into assignments associated with probabilities for their correctness. This application, called PINE-NMR, is available from a freely accessible computer server (http://pine.nmrfam.wisc.edu). The PINE-NMR server accepts as input the sequence of the protein plus user-specified combinations of data corresponding to an extensive list of NMR experiments; it provides as output a probabilistic assignment of NMR signals (chemical shifts) to sequence-specific backbone and aliphatic side chain atoms plus a probabilistic determination of the protein secondary structure. PINE-NMR can accommodate prior information about assignments or stable isotope labeling schemes. As part of the analysis, PINE-NMR identifies, verifies, and rectifies problems related to chemical shift referencing or erroneous input data. PINE-NMR achieves robust and consistent results that have been shown to be effective in subsequent steps of NMR structure determination.
","What mathematicians call the “labeling problem” underlies difficulties in interpreting many classes of complex biological data. To derive valid inferences from multiple, noisy datasets, one must consider all possible combinations of the data to find the solution that best matches the experimental evidence. Exhaustive searches totally outstrip current computer resources, and, as a result, it has been necessary to resort to approximations such as branch and bound or Monte Carlo simulations, which have the disadvantages of being limited to use in separate steps of the analysis and not providing the final results in a probabilistic fashion that allows the quality of the answers to be evaluated. The Probabilistic Interaction Network of Evidence (PINE) algorithm that we present here offers a general solution to this problem. We have demonstrated the usefulness of the PINE approach by applying it to one of the major bottlenecks in NMR spectroscopy. The PINE-NMR server takes as input the sequence of a protein and the peak lists from one or more multidimensional NMR experiments and provides as output a probabilistic assignment of the NMR signals to specific atoms in the protein's covalent structure and a self-consistent probabilistic analysis of the protein's secondary structure.

"Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), expresses two proteins with homology to human glycogen synthase kinase 3β (HsGSK-3) designated TbruGSK-3 short and TbruGSK-3 long. TbruGSK-3 short has previously been validated as a potential drug target and since this enzyme has also been pursued as a human drug target, a large number of inhibitors are available for screening against the parasite enzyme. A collaborative industrial/academic partnership facilitated by the World Health Organisation Tropical Diseases Research division (WHO TDR) was initiated to stimulate research aimed at identifying new drugs for treating HAT.
A subset of over 16,000 inhibitors of HsGSK-3 β from the Pfizer compound collection was screened against the shorter of two orthologues of TbruGSK-3. The resulting active compounds were tested for selectivity versus HsGSK-3β and a panel of human kinases, as well as in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity. Structural analysis of the human and trypanosomal enzymes was also performed.
We identified potent and selective compounds representing potential attractive starting points for a drug discovery program. Structural analysis of the human and trypanosomal enzymes also revealed hypotheses for further improving selectivity of the compounds.
","Over 60 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of infection with the parasite Trypanosoma brucei which causes Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. The disease results in systemic and neurological disability to its victims. At present, only four drugs are available for treatment of HAT. However, these drugs are expensive, limited in efficacy and are severely toxic, hence the need to develop new therapies. Previously, the short TbruGSK-3 short has been validated as a potential target for developing new drugs against HAT. Because this enzyme has also been pursued as a drug target for other diseases, several inhibitors are available for screening against the parasite enzyme. Here we present the results of screening over 16,000 inhibitors of human GSK-3β (HsGSK-3) from the Pfizer compound collection against TbruGSK-3 short. The resulting active compounds were tested for selectivity versus HsGSK-3β and a panel of human kinases, as well as their ability to inhibit proliferation of the parasite in vitro. We have identified attractive compounds that now form potential starting points for drug discovery against HAT. This is an example of how a tripartite partnership involving pharmaceutical industries, academic institutions and non-government organisations such as WHO TDR, can stimulate research for neglected diseases.

"Leishmaniasis remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropics. Available therapies are problematic due to toxicity, treatment duration and emerging drug resistance. Mouse models of leishmaniasis have demonstrated that disease outcome depends critically on the balance between effector and regulatory CD4+ T cell responses, something mirrored in descriptive studies of human disease. Recombinant IL-2/diphtheria toxin fusion protein (rIL-2/DTx), a drug that is FDA-approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, has been reported to deplete regulatory CD4+ T cells.
We investigated the potential efficacy of rIL-2/DTx as adjunctive therapy for experimental infection with Leishmania major. Treatment with rIL-2/DTx suppressed lesional regulatory T cell numbers and was associated with significantly increased antigen-specific IFN-γ production, enhanced lesion resolution and decreased parasite burden. Combined administration of rIL-2/DTx and sodium stibogluconate had additive biological and therapeutic effects, allowing for reduced duration or dose of sodium stibogluconate therapy.
These data suggest that pharmacological suppression of immune counterregulation using a commercially available drug originally developed for cancer therapy may have practical therapeutic utility in leishmaniasis. Rational reinvestigation of the efficacy of drugs approved for other indications in experimental models of neglected tropical diseases has promise in providing new candidates to the drug discovery pipeline.
","Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease that causes a large burden of morbidity and mortality in the tropics. Caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania that are transmitted by sandflies, leishmaniasis causes a wide spectrum of human disease. The severe end of the spectrum, visceral leishmaniasis, causes an annual mortality of approximately 50,000, largely in India and Sudan. Available therapies for leishmaniasis are problematic due to emerging drug resistance, toxicity and/or the need for lengthy courses of treatment. There is thus an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches to this neglected tropical disease. To address this problem, the authors examined whether a commercially available drug developed for cancer therapy (Ontak), reported to have immunological activity of relevance to the immunobiology of Leishmania infection, exhibited efficacy in mouse models of leishmaniasis. The study found therapeutic efficacy for the drug alone in these models, as well as additive therapeutic efficacy in combination with standard antimicrobial therapy. Rational reinvestigation of the efficacy of already approved drugs in experimental models of neglected tropical diseases has promise in providing needed new candidates to the drug discovery pipeline.

"The regulatory roles of sphingolipids in diverse cell functions have been characterized extensively. However, the dynamics and interactions among the different sphingolipid species are difficult to assess, because de novo biosynthesis, metabolic inter-conversions, and the retrieval of sphingolipids from membranes form a complex, highly regulated pathway system. Here we analyze the heat stress response of this system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate how the cell dynamically adjusts its enzyme profile so that it is appropriate for operation under stress conditions before changes in gene expression become effective. The analysis uses metabolic time series data, a complex mathematical model, and a custom-tailored optimization strategy. The results demonstrate that all enzyme activities rapidly increase in an immediate response to the elevated temperature. After just a few minutes, different functional clusters of enzymes follow distinct activity patterns. Interestingly, starting after about six minutes, both de novo biosynthesis and all exit routes from central sphingolipid metabolism become blocked, and the remaining metabolic activity consists entirely of an internal redistribution among different sphingoid base and ceramide pools. After about 30 minutes, heat stress is still in effect and the enzyme activity profile is still significantly changed. Importantly, however, the metabolites have regained concentrations that are essentially the same as those under optimal conditions.
","Sphingolipids play dual roles by serving as components of membrane rafts and by regulating numerous key cell functions. Although sphingolipids have been studied extensively, the details of their functioning are difficult to understand, because their synthesis, pathways of inter-conversion, and utilization constitute a complex, dynamically changing system. We analyze the role of yeast sphingolipids in the response to heat stress. Data show that the profile of these lipids changes almost immediately with the initiation of the stress, but it is a priori unclear how this response is organized. Using experimental data, a sophisticated dynamic model, and a novel optimization strategy, we show how changes in enzyme activities are temporally organized. Intriguingly, the results show that the cells take up as much material as possible in the first few minutes of heat stress and then shut down entry and exit routes of the biosynthetic pathway system. After about 30 minutes, when heat stress is still in effect, the enzyme activity profile is still significantly changed, but the metabolites have regained concentrations that are essentially the same as those under optimal conditions. The results demonstrate how novel insights are achievable with an effective combination of experimental and theoretical research.

"Genes or their encoded products are not expected to mingle with each other unless in some disease situations. In cancer, a frequent mechanism that can produce gene fusions is chromosomal rearrangement. However, recent discoveries of RNA trans-splicing and cis-splicing between adjacent genes (cis-SAGe) support for other mechanisms in generating fusion RNAs. In our transcriptome analyses of 28 prostate normal and cancer samples, 30% fusion RNAs on average are the transcripts that contain exons belonging to same-strand neighboring genes. These fusion RNAs may be the products of cis-SAGe, which was previously thought to be rare. To validate this finding and to better understand the phenomenon, we used LNCaP, a prostate cell line as a model, and identified 16 additional cis-SAGe events by silencing transcription factor CTCF and paired-end RNA sequencing. About half of the fusions are expressed at a significant level compared to their parental genes. Silencing one of the in-frame fusions resulted in reduced cell motility. Most out-of-frame fusions are likely to function as non-coding RNAs. The majority of the 16 fusions are also detected in other prostate cell lines, as well as in the 14 clinical prostate normal and cancer pairs. By studying the features associated with these fusions, we developed a set of rules: 1) the parental genes are same-strand-neighboring genes; 2) the distance between the genes is within 30kb; 3) the 5′ genes are actively transcribing; and 4) the chimeras tend to have the second-to-last exon in the 5′ genes joined to the second exon in the 3′ genes. We then randomly selected 20 neighboring genes in the genome, and detected four fusion events using these rules in prostate cancer and non-cancerous cells. These results suggest that splicing between neighboring gene transcripts is a rather frequent phenomenon, and it is not a feature unique to cancer cells.
","Genes are considered the units of hereditary information; thus, neither genes nor their encoded products are expected to mingle with each other unless in some disease situations. However, the genes are not alone in the genome. Genes have neighbors, some close, some far. With RNA-seq, many fusion RNAs involving neighboring genes are being identified. However, little is done to validate and characterize the fusion RNAs. Using one prostate cell line and a discovery pipeline for cis-splicing between adjacent genes (cis-SAGe), we found 16 new such events. We then developed a set of rules based on the characteristics of these fusion RNAs, and applied them to 20 random neighboring gene pairs. Four turned out to be true. The majority of the fusions are found in cancer cells, as well as in non-cancer cells. These results suggest that the genes are “leaky”, and the fusions are not limited to cancer cells.

"Erythropoiesis is one of the best understood examples of cellular differentiation. Morphologically, erythroid differentiation proceeds in a nearly identical fashion between humans and mice, but recent evidence has shown that networks of gene expression governing this process are divergent between species. We undertook a systematic comparative analysis of six histone modifications and four transcriptional master regulators in primary proerythroblasts and erythroid cell lines to better understand the underlying basis of these transcriptional differences. Our analyses suggest that while chromatin structure across orthologous promoters is strongly conserved, subtle differences are associated with transcriptional divergence between species. Many transcription factor (TF) occupancy sites were poorly conserved across species (∼25% for GATA1, TAL1, and NFE2) but were more conserved between proerythroblasts and cell lines derived from the same species. We found that certain cis-regulatory modules co-occupied by GATA1, TAL1, and KLF1 are under strict evolutionary constraint and localize to genes necessary for erythroid cell identity. More generally, we show that conserved TF occupancy sites are indicative of active regulatory regions and strong gene expression that is sustained during maturation. Our results suggest that evolutionary turnover of TF binding sites associates with changes in the underlying chromatin structure, driving transcriptional divergence. We provide examples of how this framework can be applied to understand epigenomic variation in specific regulatory regions, such as the β-globin gene locus. Our findings have important implications for understanding epigenomic changes that mediate variation in cellular differentiation across species, while also providing a valuable resource for studies of hematopoiesis.
","The process whereby blood progenitor cells differentiate into red blood cells, known as erythropoiesis, is very similar between mice and humans. Yet, while studies of this process in mouse have substantially improved our knowledge of human erythropoiesis, recent work has shown a significant divergence in global gene expression across species, suggesting that extrapolation from mouse models to human is not always straightforward. In order to better understand these differences, we have performed a comparative epigenomic analysis of six histone modifications and four master transcription factors. By globally comparing chromatin structure across primary cells and model cell lines in both species, we discovered that while chromatin structure is well conserved at orthologous promoters, subtle changes are predictive of species-specific gene expression. Furthermore, we discovered that the genomic localizations of master transcription factors are poorly conserved, and species-specific losses or gains are associated with changes to the underlying chromatin structure and concomitant gene expression. By using our comparative epigenomics framework, we identified a putative human-specific cis-regulatory module that drives expression of human, but not mouse, GDF15, a gene implicated in iron homeostasis. Our results provide a resource to aid researchers in interpreting genetic and epigenetic differences between species.

"Endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) in mice are significant genomic mutagens, causing ∼10% of all reported spontaneous germ line mutations in laboratory strains. The majority of these mutations are due to insertions of two high copy ERV families, the IAP and ETn/MusD elements. This significant level of ongoing retrotranspositional activity suggests that inbred mice are highly variable in content of these two ERV groups. However, no comprehensive genome-wide studies have been performed to assess their level of polymorphism. Here we compared three test strains, for which sufficient genomic sequence is available, to each other and to the reference C57BL/6J genome and detected very high levels of insertional polymorphism for both ERV families, with an estimated false discovery rate of only 0.4%. Specifically, we found that at least 60% of IAP and 25% of ETn/MusD elements detected in any strain are absent in one or more of the other three strains. The polymorphic nature of a set of 40 ETn/MusD elements found within gene introns was confirmed using genomic PCR on DNA from a panel of mouse strains. For some cases, we detected gene-splicing abnormalities involving the ERV and obtained additional evidence for decreased gene expression in strains carrying the insertion. In total, we identified nearly 700 polymorphic IAP or ETn/MusD ERVs or solitary LTRs that reside in gene introns, providing potential candidates that may contribute to gene expression differences among strains. These extreme levels of polymorphism suggest that ERV insertions play a significant role in genetic drift of mouse lines.
","The laboratory mouse is the most widely used mammal for biological research. Hundreds of inbred mouse strains have been developed that vary in characteristics such as susceptibility to cancer or other diseases. There is much interest in uncovering differences between strains that result in different traits and, to aid this effort, millions of single nucleotide differences or polymorphisms between strains have been cataloged. To date, there has been less emphasis placed on other sources of genetic variation. In this study, we have conducted a genome-wide analysis to examine the level of polymorphism of mouse endogenous retroviral sequences (ERVs). ERVs are derived from infectious retroviruses that now exist in the genome and are inherited as part of chromosomes. Unlike in humans, genomic insertions of ERVs cause many new mutations in mice but their extent of variation between strains has been difficult to study because of their high copy numbers. By comparing genomic sequences of four common mouse strains, we found very high levels of polymorphism for two large active families of ERVs. Moreover, we documented nearly 700 polymorphic ERVs located within gene introns and found evidence that some of these affect gene transcript levels. This study demonstrates that ERV polymorphisms are a major source of genetic variability among mouse strains and likely contribute to strain-specific traits.

"During transcription, most eukaryotic genes generate multiple alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) sites, leading to the production of transcript isoforms with variable lengths in the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR). In contrast to somatic cells, male germ cells, especially pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids, express a distinct reservoir of mRNAs with shorter 3’UTRs that are essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility. However, the mechanisms underlying the enrichment of shorter 3’UTR transcripts in the developing male germ cells remain unknown. Here, we report that UPF2-mediated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) plays an essential role in male germ cells by eliminating ubiquitous genes-derived, longer 3’UTR transcripts, and that this role is independent of its canonical role in degrading “premature termination codon” (PTC)-containing transcripts in somatic cell lineages. This report provides physiological evidence supporting a noncanonical role of the NMD pathway in achieving global 3’UTR shortening in the male germ cells during spermatogenesis.
","3’UTR length control has been identified as a critical mechanism through which the cell establishes and maintains its functional identity. Developing male germ cells, especially spermatocytes and spermatids, display a transcriptome enriched in short 3’UTR transcripts, which has been demonstrated to be essential for spermatogenesis. However, it remains unknown how global 3’UTR shortening is achieved. Here, we report that most of the genes, especially those ubiquitously expressed, are transcribed into multiple isoforms in spermatocytes, and when spermatocytes develop into round spermatids, those long 3’UTR transcripts are selectively degraded by UPF2-dependent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), leading to enrichment of the shorter 3’UTR transcripts. We provide physiological evidence supporting a non-canonical role of NMD in the control of 3’UTR length in male germ cells.

"Sodium-Galactose Transporter (SGLT) is a secondary active symporter which accumulates sugars into cells by using the electrochemical gradient of Na+ across the membrane. Previous computational studies provided insights into the release process of the two ligands (galactose and sodium ion) into the cytoplasm from the inward-facing conformation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus sodium/galactose transporter (vSGLT). Several aspects of the transport mechanism of this symporter remain to be clarified: (i) a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of the exit path of the two ligands is still lacking; (ii) contradictory conclusions have been drawn concerning the gating role of Y263; (iii) the role of Na+ in modulating the release path of galactose is not clear. In this work, we use bias-exchange metadynamics simulations to characterize the free energy profile of the galactose and Na+ release processes toward the intracellular side. Surprisingly, we find that the exit of Na+ and galactose is non-concerted as the cooperativity between the two ligands is associated to a transition that is not rate limiting. The dissociation barriers are of the order of 11–12 kcal/mol for both the ion and the substrate, in line with kinetic information concerning this type of transporters. On the basis of these results we propose a branched six-state alternating access mechanism, which may be shared also by other members of the LeuT-fold transporters.
","Membrane proteins are crucial for the communication of the cell with the environment. Among these, symporters are in charge of the transport of molecules (like sugars, amino acids, osmolytes) inside the cells, exploiting the concentration gradient of an ion to perform the task. Here we investigate by atomistic simulations the transport mechanism of the Sodium-Galactose symporter. Our results allow constructing a detailed and quantitative model of the release process of the two ligands. Surprisingly, we find that the galactose is released to the cytosol independently from the ion, unambiguously indicating that the coupling in their transport mechanism is associated to the steps preceding the release process. A large family of symporters shares the same fold and potentially the same transport mechanism. As such our results are important also because they can provide insights on common mechanistic features of these transporters.

"Rabies continues to be a major public health problem in the Philippines, where 200–300 human cases were reported annually between 2001 and 2011. Understanding the phylogeography of rabies viruses is important for establishing a more effective and feasible control strategy.
We performed a molecular analysis of rabies viruses in the Philippines using rabied animal brain samples. The samples were collected from 11 of 17 regions, which covered three island groups (Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao). Partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequencing was performed on 57 samples and complete glycoprotein (G) gene sequencing was performed on 235 samples collected between 2004 and 2010.
The Philippine strains of rabies viruses were included in a distinct phylogenetic cluster, previously named Asian 2b, which appeared to have diverged from the Chinese strain named Asian 2a. The Philippine strains were further divided into three major clades, which were found exclusively in different island groups: clades L, V, and M in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, respectively. Clade L was subdivided into nine subclades (L1–L9) and clade V was subdivided into two subclades (V1 and V2). With a few exceptions, most strains in each subclade were distributed in specific geographic areas. There were also four strains that were divided into two genogroups but were not classified into any of the three major clades, and all four strains were found in the island group of Luzon.
We detected three major clades and two distinct genogroups of rabies viruses in the Philippines. Our data suggest that viruses of each clade and subclade evolved independently in each area without frequent introduction into other areas. An important implication of these data is that geographically targeted dog vaccination using the island group approach may effectively control rabies in the Philippines.

The three major clades L, V, and M were found specifically in the Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao island groups, respectively. Additionally, two minor genogroups were located in the Luzon island group. These data suggest that although human mediated transmission may have occurred, these virus clades evolved independently after a single introduction into each island group. All of the analyzed Philippine strains were clustered into Asian 2b, which diverged from the Chinese strain Asian 2a. No recent introduction of rabies into the Philippines from other countries was apparent. The elimination of rabies by 2020 is a national goal in the Philippines, necessitating urgent development of a more effective and feasible strategy for controlling rabies. Our findings indicate that a geographically targeted dog vaccination campaign may effectively control rabies in island nations such as the Philippines.

"Speech production involves the movement of the mouth and other regions of the face resulting in visual motion cues. These visual cues enhance intelligibility and detection of auditory speech. As such, face-to-face speech is fundamentally a multisensory phenomenon. If speech is fundamentally multisensory, it should be reflected in the evolution of vocal communication: similar behavioral effects should be observed in other primates. Old World monkeys share with humans vocal production biomechanics and communicate face-to-face with vocalizations. It is unknown, however, if they, too, combine faces and voices to enhance their perception of vocalizations. We show that they do: monkeys combine faces and voices in noisy environments to enhance their detection of vocalizations. Their behavior parallels that of humans performing an identical task. We explored what common computational mechanism(s) could explain the pattern of results we observed across species. Standard explanations or models such as the principle of inverse effectiveness and a “race” model failed to account for their behavior patterns. Conversely, a “superposition model”, positing the linear summation of activity patterns in response to visual and auditory components of vocalizations, served as a straightforward but powerful explanatory mechanism for the observed behaviors in both species. As such, it represents a putative homologous mechanism for integrating faces and voices across primates.
","The evolution of speech is one of our most fascinating and enduring mysteries—enduring partly because all the critical features of speech (brains, vocal tracts, ancestral speech-like sounds) do not fossilize. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that speech is, by default, a multimodal phenomenon: we use both faces and voices together to communicate. Thus, understanding the evolution of speech requires a comparative approach using closely-related extant primate species and recognition that vocal communication is audiovisual. Using computer-generated avatar faces, we compared the integration of faces and voices in monkeys and humans performing an identical detection task. Both species responded faster when faces and voices were presented together relative to the face or voice alone. While the details sometimes appeared to differ, the behavior of both species could be well explained by a “superposition” model positing the linear summation of activity patterns in response to visual and auditory components of vocalizations. Other, more popular computational models of multisensory integration failed to explain our data. Thus, the superposition model represents a putative homologous mechanism for integrating faces and voices across primate species.

"The birth of new genes is an important motor of evolutionary innovation. Whereas many new genes arise by gene duplication, others originate at genomic regions that did not contain any genes or gene copies. Some of these newly expressed genes may acquire coding or non-coding functions and be preserved by natural selection. However, it is yet unclear which is the prevalence and underlying mechanisms of de novo gene emergence. In order to obtain a comprehensive view of this process, we have performed in-depth sequencing of the transcriptomes of four mammalian species—human, chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse—and subsequently compared the assembled transcripts and the corresponding syntenic genomic regions. This has resulted in the identification of over five thousand new multiexonic transcriptional events in human and/or chimpanzee that are not observed in the rest of species. Using comparative genomics, we show that the expression of these transcripts is associated with the gain of regulatory motifs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and of U1 snRNP sites downstream of the TSS. In general, these transcripts show little evidence of purifying selection, suggesting that many of them are not functional. However, we find signatures of selection in a subset of de novo genes which have evidence of protein translation. Taken together, the data support a model in which frequently-occurring new transcriptional events in the genome provide the raw material for the evolution of new proteins.
","For the past 20 years scientists have puzzled over a strange-yet-ubiquitous genomic phenomenon; in every genome there are sets of genes which are unique to that particular species i.e. lacking homologues in any other species. How have these genes originated? The advent of massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has provided new clues to this question, with the discovery of an unexpectedly high number of transcripts that do not correspond to typical protein-coding genes, and which could serve as a substrate for this process. Here we have examined RNA-Seq data from 8 mammalian species in order to define a set of putative newly-born genes in human and chimpanzee and investigate what drives their expression. This is the largest-scale project to date that tries to address this scientific question. We have found thousands of transcripts that are human and/or chimpanzee-specific and which are likely to have originated de novo from previously non-transcribed regions of the genome. We have observed an enrichment in transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions of these genes when compared to other species; this is consistent with the idea that the gain of new regulatory motifs results in de novo gene expression. We also show that some of the genes encode new functional proteins expressed in brain or testis, which may have contributed to phenotypic novelties in human evolution.

"The evolution of drug-resistance in pathogens is a major global health threat. Elucidating the molecular basis of pathogen drug-resistance has been the focus of many studies but rarely is it known whether a drug-resistance mechanism identified is universal for the studied pathogen; it has seldom been clarified whether drug-resistance mechanisms vary with the pathogen's genotype. Nevertheless this is of critical importance in gaining an understanding of the complexity of this global threat and in underpinning epidemiological surveillance of pathogen drug resistance in the field. This study aimed to assess the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity that emerges in natural parasite populations under drug treatment pressure. We studied lines of the protozoan parasite Leishmania (L.) donovani with differential susceptibility to antimonial drugs; the lines being derived from clinical isolates belonging to two distinct genetic populations that circulate in the leishmaniasis endemic region of Nepal. Parasite pathways known to be affected by antimonial drugs were characterised on five experimental levels in the lines of the two populations. Characterisation of DNA sequence, gene expression, protein expression and thiol levels revealed a number of molecular features that mark antimonial-resistant parasites in only one of the two populations studied. A final series of in vitro stress phenotyping experiments confirmed this heterogeneity amongst drug-resistant parasites from the two populations. These data provide evidence that the molecular changes associated with antimonial-resistance in natural Leishmania populations depend on the genetic background of the Leishmania population, which has resulted in a divergent set of resistance markers in the Leishmania populations. This heterogeneity of parasite adaptations provides severe challenges for the control of drug resistance in the field and the design of molecular surveillance tools for widespread applicability.
","Drug resistance is a serious problem that strikes at the core of infectious disease control. The mechanisms developed by pathogens to become resistant against existing drug treatments have been studied for many years but these studies have frequently scrutinized a few lines of the pathogen and rarely is it known whether the mechanisms identified occur in all pathogen populations present in endemic regions. In this study we assessed the diversity amongst drug-resistant parasites which emerged under treatment pressure in a natural parasite population. An extensive molecular and phenotypic characterisation of a collection of Leishmania donovani parasites isolated from leishmaniasis patients revealed that the parasites which are resistant to treatment have heterogeneous characters. The results provide evidence that how a parasite develops resistance under treatment pressure depends upon its genetic background. These findings provide key insights into the challenge that drug resistance poses for the control of infectious diseases like leishmaniasis.

"One view of adaptation is that it proceeds by the slow and steady accumulation of beneficial mutations with small effects. It is difficult to test this model, since in most cases the genetic basis of adaptation can only be studied a posteriori with traits that have evolved for a long period of time through an unknown sequence of steps. In this paper, we show how ace-1, a gene involved in resistance to organophosphorous insecticide in the mosquito Culex pipiens, has evolved during 40 years of an insecticide control program. Initially, a major resistance allele with strong deleterious side effects spread through the population. Later, a duplication combining a susceptible and a resistance ace-1 allele began to spread but did not replace the original resistance allele, as it is sublethal when homozygous. Last, a second duplication, (also sublethal when homozygous) began to spread because heterozygotes for the two duplications do not exhibit deleterious pleiotropic effects. Double overdominance now maintains these four alleles across treated and nontreated areas. Thus, ace-1 evolution does not proceed via the steady accumulation of beneficial mutations. Instead, resistance evolution has been an erratic combination of mutation, positive selection, and the rearrangement of existing variation leading to complex genetic architecture.
","Adaptation is not always a straightforward process, and often results from natural selection tinkering with available variation. We present in this study just such a tortuous natural selection pathway, which allows the mosquito Culex pipiens to resist organophosphorous insecticides. In the Montpellier area, following the use of insecticide to control mosquito populations, a high-resistance allele of the insecticide target enzyme appeared. But this allele also displayed strong deleterious side effects. Recently, several duplicated haplotypes began to spread in natural population that put in tandem a susceptible and a resistant allele. We show that the duplicated haplotypes actually display reduced side effects compared to the resistant allele when in the heterozygous state, but also new and strong costs in the homozygote. This pattern leads to an unexpected equilibrium between four different alleles across treated and nontreated areas. The story of resistance in C. pipiens is indeed far from a slow progression toward a “perfect” adaptation. Rather, selection for resistance to insecticide is a long process of trial and error leading to an uncommon genetic architecture.

"Axonal transport is responsible for the movement of signals and cargo between nerve termini and cell bodies. Pathogens also exploit this pathway to enter and exit the central nervous system. In this study, we characterised the binding, endocytosis and axonal transport of an adenovirus (CAV-2) that preferentially infects neurons. Using biochemical, cell biology, genetic, ultrastructural and live-cell imaging approaches, we show that interaction with the neuronal membrane correlates with coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) surface expression, followed by endocytosis involving clathrin. In axons, long-range CAV-2 motility was bidirectional with a bias for retrograde transport in nonacidic Rab7-positive organelles. Unexpectedly, we found that CAR was associated with CAV-2 vesicles that also transported cargo as functionally distinct as tetanus toxin, neurotrophins, and their receptors. These results suggest that a single axonal transport carrier is capable of transporting functionally distinct cargoes that target different membrane compartments in the soma. We propose that CAV-2 transport is dictated by an innate trafficking of CAR, suggesting an unsuspected function for this adhesion protein during neuronal homeostasis.
","Adenoviruses commonly cause subclinical morbidity in the ocular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts, and less frequently, adenovirus-induced disease can be fatal for newborns and immunocompromised hosts. In addition, adenoviruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS) and cause associated encephalitis and tumours. On the flip side, during the last two decades, adenovirus vectors have become powerful tools to treat and address diseases of the CNS. Despite the fact that axonal transport of adenoviruses was reported more than 15 years ago, nothing was known concerning how adenoviruses access the CNS. The characterization of their interactions with brain cells was therefore long overdue. In this study, we describe the axonal trafficking of an adenovirus that preferentially infects neurons and reaches the CNS through long-range axonal transport. We show that this adenovirus exploits an endogenous vesicular pathway used by the adhesion molecule CAR (coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor). Our study characterizes this endogenous route of access, which is likely to be crucial to neuronal survival, neurodegenerative diseases, gene transfer vectors, and adenovirus-induced morbidity.

"Critical transitions are sudden, often irreversible, changes that can occur in a large variety of complex systems; signals that warn of critical transitions are therefore highly desirable. We propose a new method for early warning signals that integrates multiple sources of information and data about the system through the framework of a generalized model. We demonstrate our proposed approach through several examples, including a previously published fisheries model. We regard our method as complementary to existing early warning signals, taking an approach of intermediate complexity between model-free approaches and fully parameterized simulations. One potential advantage of our approach is that, under appropriate conditions, it may reduce the amount of time series data required for a robust early warning signal.
","Fisheries, coral reefs, productive farmland, planetary climate, neural activity in the brain, and financial markets are all complex systems that can be susceptible to sudden changes leading to drastic re-organization or collapse. A variety of signals based on analysis of time-series data have been proposed that would provide warning of these so-called critical transitions. We propose a new method for calculating early warning signals that is complementary to existing approaches. The key step is to incorporate other available information about the system through the framework of a so-called generalized model. Our new approach may help to anticipate future catastrophic regime shifts in nature and society, allowing humankind to avert or to mitigate the consequences of the impending change.

"Emerging evidence indicates that gene products implicated in human cancers often cluster together in “hot spots” in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Additionally, small sub-networks within PPI networks that demonstrate synergistic differential expression with respect to tumorigenic phenotypes were recently shown to be more accurate classifiers of disease progression when compared to single targets identified by traditional approaches. However, many of these studies rely exclusively on mRNA expression data, a useful but limited measure of cellular activity. Proteomic profiling experiments provide information at the post-translational level, yet they generally screen only a limited fraction of the proteome. Here, we demonstrate that integration of these complementary data sources with a “proteomics-first” approach can enhance the discovery of candidate sub-networks in cancer that are well-suited for mechanistic validation in disease. We propose that small changes in the mRNA expression of multiple genes in the neighborhood of a protein-hub can be synergistically associated with significant changes in the activity of that protein and its network neighbors. Further, we hypothesize that proteomic targets with significant fold change between phenotype and control may be used to “seed” a search for small PPI sub-networks that are functionally associated with these targets. To test this hypothesis, we select proteomic targets having significant expression changes in human colorectal cancer (CRC) from two independent 2-D gel-based screens. Then, we use random walk based models of network crosstalk and develop novel reference models to identify sub-networks that are statistically significant in terms of their functional association with these proteomic targets. Subsequently, using an information-theoretic measure, we evaluate synergistic changes in the activity of identified sub-networks based on genome-wide screens of mRNA expression in CRC. Cross-classification experiments to predict disease class show excellent performance using only a few sub-networks, underwriting the strength of the proposed approach in discovering relevant and reproducible sub-networks.
","Intensive research on cancer has led to an understanding of many individual genes that may be important for the initiation and progression of tumors. However, since cancer is a progressive disease that results from accumulation of multiple mutations likely acting in concert, individual markers can only provide limited insights into cellular mechanisms that underlie tumorigenesis. For this reason, recent studies focus on identification of “sub-network markers”, that is, functionally associated genes that exhibit coordinate changes in molecular expression during cancer progression. However, expression of genes is most frequently interrogated at the mRNA level, which captures functional activity of genes only to a limited extent. Screening of protein expression, on the other hand, provides information on the abundance of functional gene products, but its scale is often limited compared to screening of mRNA expression. In this article, we develop a proteomics-driven computational method that searches for sub-network markers in human colorectal cancer, based on a seed of differentially expressed proteins identified by proteomic screening. Our results show that significant changes in the expression of these proteins is likely to be associated with coordinate changes in the expression of the genes whose products are functionally associated with these proteins. This analysis leads to novel insights in the synergistic processes that underlie tumorigenesis.

"The ecological importance of the duplication and diversification of gene clusters that synthesize secondary metabolites in fungi remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the duplication and subsequent diversification of a gene cluster produced two polyketide synthase gene clusters in the cosmopolitan fungal genus Metarhizium. Diversification occurred in the promoter regions and the exon-intron structures of the two Pks paralogs (Pks1 and Pks2). These two Pks genes have distinct expression patterns, with Pks1 highly expressed during conidiation and Pks2 highly expressed during infection. Different upstream signaling pathways were found to regulate the two Pks genes. Pks1 is positively regulated by Hog1-MAPK, Slt2-MAPK and Mr-OPY2, while Pks2 is positively regulated by Fus3-MAPK and negatively regulated by Mr-OPY2. Pks1 and Pks2 have been subjected to positive selection and synthesize different secondary metabolites. PKS1 is involved in synthesis of an anthraquinone derivative, and contributes to conidial pigmentation, which plays an important role in fungal tolerance to UV radiation and extreme temperatures. Disruption of the Pks2 gene delayed formation of infectious structures and increased the time taken to kill insects, indicating that Pks2 contributes to pathogenesis. Thus, the duplication of a Pks gene cluster and its subsequent functional diversification has increased the adaptive flexibility of Metarhizium species.
","In fungi, gene clusters that synthesize secondary metabolites are hotspots for the generation of fungal metabolic diversity through gene duplication, but their ecological importance remains poorly understood. Metarhizium species are adapted to life as insect pathogens, plant symbionts and saprophytes, enabling the function of individual genes to be studied in diverse fungal lifestyles. We discovered that a duplication of a Pks (polyketide synthase) gene cluster in Metarhizium species has facilitated its ecological opportunism. Sequence diversifications occurred in the promoter regions, the intro-exon structures, and the coding sequences of the two Pks paralogs, and they synthesize different secondary metabolites, have different expression patterns, and are regulated by different signaling pathways. PKS1s involved in synthesis of conidial pigments and tolerance to several abiotic stresses. The Pks2 gene is involved in formation of infectious structures (appressoria), enabling these fungi to kill insects faster. This Pks gene cluster duplication event may have been important for the adaptation of Metarhizium species to diverse environments.

"Cellulose represents the most abundant biopolymer in nature and has great economic importance. Cellulose chains pack laterally into crystalline forms, stacking into a complicated crystallographic structure. However, the mechanism of cellulose crystallization is poorly understood. Here, via functional characterization, we report that Brittle Culm1 (BC1), a COBRA-like protein in rice, modifies cellulose crystallinity. BC1 was demonstrated to be a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein and can be released into cell walls by removal of the GPI anchor. BC1 possesses a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) at its N-terminus. In vitro binding assays showed that this CBM interacts specifically with crystalline cellulose, and several aromatic residues in this domain are essential for binding. It was further demonstrated that cell wall-localized BC1 via the CBM and GPI anchor is one functional form of BC1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) assays revealed that mutations in BC1 and knockdown of BC1 expression decrease the crystallite width of cellulose; overexpression of BC1 and the CBM-mutated BC1s caused varied crystallinity with results that were consistent with the in vitro binding assay. Moreover, interaction between the CBM and cellulose microfibrils was largely repressed when the cell wall residues were pre-stained with two cellulose dyes. Treating wild-type and bc1 seedlings with the dyes resulted in insensitive root growth responses in bc1 plants. Combined with the evidence that BC1 and three secondary wall cellulose synthases (CESAs) function in different steps of cellulose production as revealed by genetic analysis, we conclude that BC1 modulates cellulose assembly by interacting with cellulose and affecting microfibril crystallinity.
","Cellulose is an important natural resource with great economic value. Plant cellulose packs laterally into a complicated crystallographic structure, which determines cellulose quality and commercial uses. However, the mechanism of cellulose crystallization is poorly understood. Here we report that Brittle Culm1 (BC1), a COBRA-like (COBL) protein of rice, modifies cellulose crystallinity. Although previous studies have indicated the involvement of COB and COBL proteins in cellulose biosynthesis, the underlying molecular basis for this remains elusive. We demonstrate that BC1 localizes to the cell-wall and functions in a process that is distinct from that of the three secondary wall cellulose synthases (CESAs). A carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) at the N-terminus of BC1 interacts specifically with crystalline cellulose and regulates microfibril crystallite size. We conclude that BC1 modulates cellulose structure by binding to cellulose and affecting microfibril crystallinity. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of cellulose assembly and further our understanding of the roles of COB and COBLs in cell wall biogenesis.

"Phages shape the structure of natural bacterial communities and can be effective therapeutic agents. Bacterial resistance to phage infection, however, limits the usefulness of phage therapies and could destabilise community structures, especially if individual resistance mutations provide cross-resistance against multiple phages. We currently understand very little about the evolution of cross-resistance in bacteria–phage interactions. Here we show that the network structure of cross-resistance among spontaneous resistance mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa evolved against each of 27 phages is highly modular. The cross-resistance network contained both symmetric (reciprocal) and asymmetric (nonreciprocal) cross-resistance, forming two cross-resistance modules defined by high within- but low between-module cross-resistance. Mutations conferring cross-resistance within modules targeted either lipopolysaccharide or type IV pilus biosynthesis, suggesting that the modularity of cross-resistance was structured by distinct phage receptors. In contrast, between-module cross-resistance was provided by mutations affecting the alternative sigma factor, RpoN, which controls many lifestyle-associated functions, including motility, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing. Broader cross-resistance range was not associated with higher fitness costs or weaker resistance against the focal phage used to select resistance. However, mutations in rpoN, providing between-module cross-resistance, were associated with higher fitness costs than mutations associated with within-module cross-resistance, i.e., in genes encoding either lipopolysaccharide or type IV pilus biosynthesis. The observed structure of cross-resistance predicted both the frequency of resistance mutations and the ability of phage combinations to suppress bacterial growth. These findings suggest that the evolution of cross-resistance is common, is likely to play an important role in the dynamic structure of bacteria–phage communities, and could inform the design principles for phage therapy treatments.
","Phage therapy is a promising alternative to antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. Yet as with antibiotics, bacteria readily evolve resistance to phage attack, including cross-resistance that protects against multiple phages at once and so limits the usefulness of phage cocktails. Here we show, using laboratory experimental evolution of resistance against 27 phages in P. aeruginosa, that cross-resistance is common and determines the ability of phage combinations to suppress bacterial growth. Using whole-genome sequencing, we show that cross-resistance is most common against multiple phages that use the same receptor but that global regulator mutations provide generalist resistance, probably by simultaneously affecting the expression of multiple different phage receptors. Future trials should test if these features of cross-resistance evolution translate to more complex in vivo environments and can therefore be exploited to design more effective phage therapies for the clinic.

"8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG) are among the most common oxidative DNA lesions and are substrates for 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1)–initiated DNA base excision repair (BER). Mammalian telomeres consist of triple guanine repeats and are subject to oxidative guanine damage. Here, we investigated the impact of oxidative guanine damage and its repair by OGG1 on telomere integrity in mice. The mouse cells were analyzed for telomere integrity by telomere quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (telomere–FISH), by chromosome orientation–FISH (CO–FISH), and by indirect immunofluorescence in combination with telomere–FISH and for oxidative base lesions by Fpg-incision/Southern blot assay. In comparison to the wild type, telomere lengthening was observed in Ogg1 null (Ogg1−/−) mouse tissues and primary embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) cultivated in hypoxia condition (3% oxygen), whereas telomere shortening was detected in Ogg1−/− mouse hematopoietic cells and primary MEFs cultivated in normoxia condition (20% oxygen) or in the presence of an oxidant. In addition, telomere length abnormalities were accompanied by altered telomere sister chromatid exchanges, increased telomere single- and double-strand breaks, and preferential telomere lagging- or G-strand losses in Ogg1−/− mouse cells. Oxidative guanine lesions were increased in telomeres in Ogg1−/− mice with aging and primary MEFs cultivated in 20% oxygen. Furthermore, oxidative guanine lesions persisted at high level in Ogg1−/− MEFs after acute exposure to hydrogen peroxide, while they rapidly returned to basal level in wild-type MEFs. These findings indicate that oxidative guanine damage can arise in telomeres where it affects length homeostasis, recombination, DNA replication, and DNA breakage repair. Our studies demonstrate that BER pathway is required in repairing oxidative guanine damage in telomeres and maintaining telomere integrity in mammals.
","It has been proposed that oxidative DNA damage compromises telomere integrity. However, neither the types nor the consequences of oxidative DNA damage in telomeres have been fully explored. Oxidative base lesions, especially 8-oxoG and FapyG are among the most common oxidative DNA damage. These guanine lesions are excised by a DNA glycosylase, OGG1, and subsequently replaced by normal guanines via BER pathway. Telomeric DNA is rich in guanine, and guanine base is prone to be oxidized to 8-oxoG and FapyG. To study if 8-oxoG and FapyG accumulate in telomeres and affect telomere integrity in mammals, we utilized a mouse model that was genetically deleted for the Ogg1 gene (it is thus defective in 8-oxoG and FapyG repair). We found that oxidative guanine lesions accumulated in telomeres in Ogg1 deficient mouse cells, which was associated with multiple telomere defects. These findings demonstrate that oxidative guanine damage can perturb telomere integrity and that BER pathway actively participates in oxidative base repair in telomeres in mammals. Our studies will be beneficial for uncovering the role of oxidative DNA damage and BER in mammalian telomeres.

"Checkpoints are surveillance mechanisms that constitute a barrier to oncogenesis by preserving genome integrity. Loss of checkpoint function is an early event in tumorigenesis. Polo kinases (Plks) are fundamental regulators of cell cycle progression in all eukaryotes and are frequently overexpressed in tumors. Through their polo box domain, Plks target multiple substrates previously phosphorylated by CDKs and MAPKs. In response to DNA damage, Plks are temporally inhibited in order to maintain the checkpoint-dependent cell cycle block while their activity is required to silence the checkpoint response and resume cell cycle progression. Here, we report that, in budding yeast, overproduction of the Cdc5 polo kinase overrides the checkpoint signaling induced by double strand DNA breaks (DSBs), preventing the phosphorylation of several Mec1/ATR targets, including Ddc2/ATRIP, the checkpoint mediator Rad9, and the transducer kinase Rad53/CHK2. We also show that high levels of Cdc5 slow down DSB processing in a Rad9-dependent manner, but do not prevent the binding of checkpoint factors to a single DSB. Finally, we provide evidence that Sae2, the functional ortholog of human CtIP, which regulates DSB processing and inhibits checkpoint signaling, is regulated by Cdc5. We propose that Cdc5 interferes with the checkpoint response to DSBs acting at multiple levels in the signal transduction pathway and at an early step required to resect DSB ends.
","Double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are dangerous chromosomal lesions that can lead to genome rearrangements, genetic instability, and cancer if not accurately repaired. Eukaryotes activate a surveillance mechanism, called DNA damage checkpoint, to arrest cell cycle progression and facilitate DNA repair. Several factors are physically recruited to DSBs, and specific kinases phosphorylate multiple targets leading to checkpoint activation. Budding yeast is a good model system to study checkpoint, and most of the factors involved in the DSBs response were originally characterized in this organism. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we explored the functional role of polo kinase Cdc5 in regulating the DSB–induced checkpoint. Polo kinases have been previously involved in checkpoint inactivation in all the eukaryotes, and they are frequently overexpressed in cancer cells. We found that elevated levels of Cdc5 affect the cellular response to a DSB at different steps, altering DNA processing and overriding the signal triggered by checkpoint kinases. Our findings suggest that Cdc5 likely regulates multiple factors in response to a DSB and provide a rationale for a proteome-wide screening to identify targets of polo kinases in yeast and human cells. Such information may have a practical application to design specific molecular tools for cancer therapy. Two related papers published in PLoS Biology—by Vidanes et al., doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1000286, and van Vugt et al., doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1000287—similarly investigate the phenomenon of checkpoint adaptation/overriding.

"Highlighting the importance of proper intracellular organization, many muscle diseases are characterized by mispositioned myonuclei. Proper positioning of myonuclei is dependent upon the microtubule motor proteins, Kinesin-1 and cytoplasmic Dynein, and there are at least two distinct mechanisms by which Kinesin and Dynein move myonuclei. The motors exert forces both directly on the nuclear surface and from the cell cortex via microtubules. How these activities are spatially segregated yet coordinated to position myonuclei is unknown. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we identified that Sunday Driver (Syd), a homolog of mammalian JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), specifically regulates Kinesin- and Dynein-dependent cortical pulling of myonuclei without affecting motor activity near the nucleus. Specifically, Syd mediates Kinesin-dependent localization of Dynein to the muscle ends, where cortically anchored Dynein then pulls microtubules and the attached myonuclei into place. Proper localization of Dynein also requires activation of the JNK signaling cascade. Furthermore, Syd functions downstream of JNK signaling because without Syd, JNK signaling is insufficient to promote Kinesin-dependent localization of Dynein to the muscle ends. The significance of Syd-dependent myonuclear positioning is illustrated by muscle-specific depletion of Syd, which impairs muscle function. Moreover, both myonuclear spacing and locomotive defects in syd mutants can be rescued by expression of mammalian JIP3 in Drosophila muscle tissue, indicating an evolutionarily conserved role for JIP3 in myonuclear movement and highlighting the utility of Drosophila as a model for studying mammalian development. Collectively, we implicate Syd/JIP3 as a novel regulator of myogenesis that is required for proper intracellular organization and tissue function.
","A common pathology found in numerous cases of muscle diseases, including congenital myopathies and muscular dystrophies, is aberrantly located nuclei within individual multinucleated muscle cells. However, whether or not mispositioned myonuclei are a cause or consequence of muscle disease states is currently debated. Here, we take advantage of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, which shares the conserved myofiber found in mammalian systems, to identify Syd as a novel regulator of myonuclear positioning. We show that Syd is responsible for mediating the activities of Kinesin and Dynein, two motor proteins that exert forces to pull myonuclei into place. Moreover, we demonstrate that Syd-dependent myonuclear positioning also requires intracellular signaling from the JNK MAPK cascade to direct when and how myonuclei are moved into proper position. This work thus identifies developmental cues that direct proper muscle morphogenesis, suggesting that cases of muscle disease may result from a failure to achieve initial spacing of myonuclei. Supporting this notion, we find that loss of Syd impairs muscle function, but resupplying Syd restores proper myonuclear spacing and muscle function. These findings are particularly important as mispositioned myonuclei gain traction as a potential contributing factor in cases of muscle disease.

"The consumption of a vertebrate blood meal by adult female mosquitoes is necessary for their reproduction, but it also presents significant physiological challenges to mosquito osmoregulation and metabolism. The renal (Malpighian) tubules of mosquitoes play critical roles in the initial processing of the blood meal by excreting excess water and salts that are ingested. However, it is unclear how the tubules contribute to the metabolism and excretion of wastes (e.g., heme, ammonia) produced during the digestion of blood.
Here we used RNA-Seq to examine global changes in transcript expression in the Malpighian tubules of the highly-invasive Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus during the first 24 h after consuming a blood meal. We found progressive, global changes in the transcriptome of the Malpighian tubules isolated from mosquitoes at 3 h, 12 h, and 24 h after a blood meal. Notably, a DAVID functional cluster analysis of the differentially-expressed transcripts revealed 1) a down-regulation of transcripts associated with oxidative metabolism, active transport, and mRNA translation, and 2) an up-regulation of transcripts associated with antioxidants and detoxification, proteolytic activity, amino-acid metabolism, and cytoskeletal dynamics.
The results suggest that blood feeding elicits a functional transition of the epithelium from one specializing in active transepithelial fluid secretion (e.g., diuresis) to one specializing in detoxification and metabolic waste excretion. Our findings provide the first insights into the putative roles of mosquito Malpighian tubules in the chronic processing of blood meals.
","The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is a vector of several medically-important arboviruses and one of the most invasive mosquito species in the world. Existing control measures for mosquitoes are presently being challenged by the emergence of resistance to insecticides that target the nervous system. Thus, it is necessary to identify novel physiological targets to guide the development of new insecticides. We recently demonstrated that the ‘kidneys’ (Malpighian tubules) of mosquitoes offer a valuable, new physiological target for insecticides. However, our understanding of how this tissue contributes to the chronic metabolic processing of blood meals by mosquitoes is limited. Here we characterize the changes in transcript expression that occur in the Malpighian tubules of adult female A. albopictus with the goal of identifying key molecular pathways that may reveal valuable targets for insecticide development. We find dramatic changes in transcript accumulation in Malpighian tubules, which 1) provide new insights into the potential functional roles of Malpighian tubules after a blood meal, and 2) reveal new potential molecular pathways and targets to guide the development of new insecticides that would disrupt the renal functions of mosquitoes.

"Alternative splicing is known to remodel protein-protein interaction networks (“interactomes”), yet large-scale determination of isoform-specific interactions remains challenging. We present a domain-based method to predict the isoform interactome from the reference interactome. First, we construct the domain-resolved reference interactome by mapping known domain-domain interactions onto experimentally-determined interactions between reference proteins. Then, we construct the isoform interactome by predicting that an isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction. Our prediction framework is of high-quality when assessed by experimental data. The predicted human isoform interactome reveals extensive network remodeling by alternative splicing. Protein pairs interacting with different isoforms of the same gene tend to be more divergent in biological function, tissue expression, and disease phenotype than protein pairs interacting with the same isoforms. Our prediction method complements experimental efforts, and demonstrates that integrating structural domain information with interactomes provides insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing.
","Protein-protein interaction networks have been extensively used in systems biology to study the role of proteins in cell function and disease. However, current network biology studies typically assume that one gene encodes one protein isoform, ignoring the effect of alternative splicing. Alternative splicing allows a gene to produce multiple protein isoforms, by alternatively selecting distinct regions in the gene to be translated to protein products. Here, we present a computational method to predict and analyze the large-scale effect of alternative splicing on protein-protein interaction networks. Starting with a reference protein-protein interaction network determined by experiments, our method annotates protein-protein interactions with domain-domain interactions, and predicts that a protein isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction as a result of alternative splicing. Our predictions reveal the central role of alternative splicing in extensively remodeling the human protein-protein interaction network, and in increasing the functional complexity of the human cell. Our prediction method complements ongoing experimental efforts by predicting isoform-specific interactions for genes not tested yet by experiments and providing insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing.

"Sex-determining mechanisms are diverse among animal lineages and can be broadly divided into two major categories: genetic and environmental. In contrast to genetic sex determination (GSD), little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental sex determination (ESD). The Doublesex (Dsx) genes play an important role in controlling sexual dimorphism in genetic sex-determining organisms such as nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. Here we report the identification of two Dsx genes from Daphnia magna, a freshwater branchiopod crustacean that parthenogenetically produces males in response to environmental cues. One of these genes, designated DapmaDsx1, is responsible for the male trait development when expressed during environmental sex determination. The domain organization of DapmaDsx1 was similar to that of Dsx from insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. Intriguingly, the molecular basis for sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 is different from that of insects. Rather than being regulated sex-specifically at the level of pre–mRNA splicing in the coding region, DapmaDsx1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in the abundance of its transcripts. During embryogenesis, expression of DapmaDsx1 was increased only in males and its transcripts were primarily detected in male-specific structures. Knock-down of DapmaDsx1 in male embryos resulted in the production of female traits including ovarian maturation, whereas ectopic expression of DapmaDsx1 in female embryos resulted in the development of male-like phenotypes. Expression patterns of another D. magna Dsx gene, DapmaDsx2, were similar to those of DapmaDsx1, but silencing and overexpression of this gene did not induce any clear phenotypic changes. These results establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype. Our findings reveal how ESD is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using GSD. We infer that there is an ancient, previously unidentified link between genetic and environmental sex determination.
","Sex determination is a fundamental biological process that can be broadly divided into two major categories. In genetic sex determination (GSD), sex-specific differentiation results from intrinsic genetic differences between males and females, whereas environmental sex determination (ESD) relies on environmental signals to induce male or female sex determination. In contrast to model organisms that utilize GSD system, environmental sex-determining organisms are poor genetic models. Therefore, although candidate genes involved in ESD have been found in vertebrates, their functions have remained largely unknown, impairing our understanding of ESD and making the comparison of sex-determining genes between both systems difficult. Here, we report the identification of a gene responsible for the production of males during environmental sex determination in the crustacean Daphnia. This gene is homologous to the Doublesex gene that is functionally conserved in animals that use GSD. Expression of Doublesex was increased primarily in male-specific structures. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses established that Daphnia Doublesex gene is a major effector that regulates the male phenotype in Daphnia. We infer that there is an ancient, previously unidentified link between genetic and environmental sex determination.

"During embryonic development, signalling molecules known as morphogens act in a concentration-dependent manner to provide positional information to responding tissues. In the early zebrafish embryo, graded signalling by members of the nodal family induces the formation of mesoderm and endoderm, thereby patterning the embryo into three germ layers. Nodal signalling has also been implicated in the establishment of the dorso-ventral axis of the embryo. Although one can infer the existence of nodal gradients by comparing gene expression patterns in wild-type embryos and embryos in which nodal signalling is diminished or augmented, real understanding can only come from directly observing the gradients. One approach is to determine local ligand concentrations in the embryo, but this is technically challenging, and the presence of inhibitors might cause the effective concentration of a ligand to differ from its actual concentration. We have therefore taken two approaches to visualise a direct response to nodal signalling. In the first, we have used transgenic embryos to study the nuclear accumulation of a Smad2-Venus fusion protein, and in the second we have used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to visualise the formation of a complex between Smad2 and Smad4. This has allowed us to visualise, in living embryos, the formation of a graded distribution of nodal signalling activity. We have quantified the formation of the gradient in time and space, and our results not only confirm that nodal signalling patterns the embryo into three germ layers, but also shed light on its role in patterning the dorso-ventral axis and highlight unexpected complexities of mesodermal patterning.
","One of the earliest events in vertebrate embryonic development is the patterning of the embryo into three germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Morphogens are signalling molecules that act in a concentration-dependent manner to induce the formation of different cell types. Members of the nodal family are thought to form a morphogen gradient in the developing zebrafish embryo and to be essential for pattern formation. Mesoderm and endoderm are believed to develop due to high levels of nodal signalling, while cells experiencing the lowest concentrations of nodal signalling become ectoderm. Although this idea is widely accepted, the formation of a nodal morphogen gradient has never been observed directly, and we have therefore used two different approaches to visualise the intensity of nodal signalling within individual cells. Our approaches have allowed us to visualise a gradient of nodal signalling activity in the developing zebrafish embryo. Quantification of the levels of nodal signalling experienced by individual cells confirms that nodal signalling patterns the animal-vegetal axis of the zebrafish embryo and, in contrast to previous studies, also suggests that it plays a role in patterning the dorso-ventral axis of the zebrafish embryo.

"The surface proteins of human influenza A viruses experience positive selection to escape both human immunity and, more recently, antiviral drug treatments. In bacteria and viruses, immune-escape and drug-resistant phenotypes often appear through a combination of several mutations that have epistatic effects on pathogen fitness. However, the extent and structure of epistasis in influenza viral proteins have not been systematically investigated. Here, we develop a novel statistical method to detect positive epistasis between pairs of sites in a protein, based on the observed temporal patterns of sequence evolution. The method rests on the simple idea that a substitution at one site should rapidly follow a substitution at another site if the sites are positively epistatic. We apply this method to the surface proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza A virus subtypes H3N2 and H1N1. Compared to a non-epistatic null distribution, we detect substantial amounts of epistasis and determine the identities of putatively epistatic pairs of sites. In particular, using sequence data alone, our method identifies epistatic interactions between specific sites in neuraminidase that have recently been demonstrated, in vitro, to confer resistance to the drug oseltamivir; these epistatic interactions are responsible for widespread drug resistance among H1N1 viruses circulating today. This experimental validation demonstrates the predictive power of our method to identify epistatic sites of importance for viral adaptation and public health. We conclude that epistasis plays a large role in shaping the molecular evolution of influenza viruses. In particular, sites with , which would normally not be identified as positively selected, can facilitate viral adaptation through epistatic interactions with their partner sites. The knowledge of specific interactions among sites in influenza proteins may help us to predict the course of antigenic evolution and, consequently, to select more appropriate vaccines and drugs.
","Epistasis describes non-additive interactions among genetic sites: the consequence of a mutation at one site may depend on the status of the genome at other sites. In an extreme case, a mutation may have no effect if it arises on one genetic background, but a strong effect on another background. Epistatic mutations in viruses and bacteria that live under severe conditions, such as antibiotic treatments or immune pressure, often allow pathogens to develop drug resistance or escape the immune system. In this paper we develop a new phylogenetic method for detecting epistasis, and we apply this method to the surface proteins of the influenza A virus, which are important targets of the immune system and drug treatments. The authors identify and characterize hundreds of epistatic mutations in these proteins. Among those identified, we find the specific epistatic mutations that were recently shown, experimentally, to confer resistance to the drug Tamiflu. The results of this study may help to predict the course of influenza's antigenic evolution and to select more appropriate vaccines and drugs.

"Serotype-specific PCR assays targeting Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, the causal agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, are required to accelerate formal diagnosis and to overcome the lack of typing sera and, in some situations, the need for culture. However, the sensitivity and specificity of such assays must be demonstrated on large collections of strains representative of the targeted serotypes and all other bacterial populations producing similar clinical symptoms.
Using a new family of repeated DNA sequences, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), as a serotype-specific target, we developed a conventional multiplex PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates. We also developed EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex PCR assays with the same two sets of primers.
We achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity for each protocol after validation of the assays on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 serotype Paratyphi A strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins and time periods and on 70 strains of bacteria frequently encountered in bloodstream infections, including 29 other Salmonella serotypes and 42 strains from 38 other bacterial species.
The performance and convenience of our serotype-specific PCR assays should facilitate the rapid and accurate identification of these two major serotypes in a large range of clinical and public health laboratories with access to PCR technology. These assays were developed for use with DNA from cultured isolates, but with modifications to the assay, the CRISPR targets could be used in the development of assays for use with clinical and other samples.
","Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are a major health problem in developing countries, where they are still endemic. Accurate diagnosis remains a challenge, as identification of the causal agents, Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, respectively, requires appropriate facilities (for bacterial culture) and specific reagents (typing antisera). Several Salmonella serotype-specific PCR assays have been published and even used directly on biological samples, but none has been validated on a large collection of strains to check for reliability and robustness. We report here the successful development of conventional and real-time PCR assays for the identification of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates. These assays, based on an original target (CRISPR), had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% in tests on a collection of more than 330 strains. The conventional multiplex PCR assay provides an alternative to the serotyping method for laboratories in developing countries unable to obtain a regular supply of typing antisera but with access to PCR technology.

"Statistical analyses of genomic data from diverse human populations have demonstrated that archaic hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, interbred or admixed with the ancestors of present-day humans. Central to these analyses are methods for inferring archaic ancestry along the genomes of present-day individuals (archaic local ancestry). Methods for archaic local ancestry inference rely on the availability of reference genomes from the ancestral archaic populations for accurate inference. However, several instances of archaic admixture lack reference archaic genomes, making it difficult to characterize these events. We present a statistical method that combines diverse population genetic summary statistics to infer archaic local ancestry without access to an archaic reference genome. We validate the accuracy and robustness of our method in simulations. When applied to genomes of European individuals, our method recovers segments that are substantially enriched for Neanderthal ancestry, even though our method did not have access to any Neanderthal reference genomes.
","Recent analyses of modern human genomes have shown that archaic hominins like Neanderthals and Denisovans contribute a few percentage of ancestry to many populations. These analyses rely on having accurate reference genomes from these archaic populations. Due to the difficulty in sequencing these genomes, we lack a complete collection of reference genomes with which to identify archaic ancestry. Here, we develop a method that identifies segments of archaic ancestry in modern human genomes without the need for archaic reference genomes. We systematically evaluate the accuracy and robustness of our method and apply it to modern European genomes to uncover signals of introgression which we confirm to be from a population related to Neanderthals.

"The link between DNA methylation, obesity, and adiposity-related diseases in the general population remains uncertain.
We conducted an association study of body mass index (BMI) and differential methylation for over 400,000 CpGs assayed by microarray in whole-blood-derived DNA from 3,743 participants in the Framingham Heart Study and the Lothian Birth Cohorts, with independent replication in three external cohorts of 4,055 participants. We examined variations in whole blood gene expression and conducted Mendelian randomization analyses to investigate the functional and clinical relevance of the findings. We identified novel and previously reported BMI-related differential methylation at 83 CpGs that replicated across cohorts; BMI-related differential methylation was associated with concurrent changes in the expression of genes in lipid metabolism pathways. Genetic instrumental variable analysis of alterations in methylation at one of the 83 replicated CpGs, cg11024682 (intronic to sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 [SREBF1]), demonstrated links to BMI, adiposity-related traits, and coronary artery disease. Independent genetic instruments for expression of SREBF1 supported the findings linking methylation to adiposity and cardiometabolic disease. Methylation at a substantial proportion (16 of 83) of the identified loci was found to be secondary to differences in BMI. However, the cross-sectional nature of the data limits definitive causal determination.
We present robust associations of BMI with differential DNA methylation at numerous loci in blood cells. BMI-related DNA methylation and gene expression provide mechanistic insights into the relationship between DNA methylation, obesity, and adiposity-related diseases.
","Genetic sequence variants explain only a modest proportion of the variation in body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic disease in the general population.
There is limited understanding of the link of DNA methylation—a well-characterized epigenetic modification—with BMI and cardiometabolic disease in the general population.
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the association of BMI with leukocyte DNA methylation at over 400,000 sites in the genome among 7,798 community-dwelling adults.
We identified associations between BMI and methylation at 83 replicated sites (including 50 novel sites) and concurrent differences in expression in whole blood of genes overrepresented in lipid metabolism pathways.
Using genetic sequence variants to model exposure to differential DNA methylation and tissue-specific gene expression, we found differential methylation and expression of SREBF1 to be implicated in BMI, adiposity-related traits, and coronary artery disease.
Using genetic sequence variants to model exposure to differences in BMI, we found a substantial proportion of the differentially methylated sites (16 of 83) to be downstream of BMI.
Evidence is accumulating that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are related to obesity-related diseases in the general population.
We provide support for a role of genomic regulation of a lipid metabolism transcription factor, SREBF1, in adiposity and coronary artery disease.
Mendelian randomization approaches can help prioritize relevant loci for future functional studies, but the cross-sectional observational nature of our study limits definitive causal inference.

"Tissue-encysting coccidia, including Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona, are heterogamous parasites with sexual and asexual life stages in definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. During its sexual life stage, T. gondii reproduces either by genetic out-crossing or via clonal amplification of a single strain through self-mating. Out-crossing has been experimentally verified as a potent mechanism capable of producing offspring possessing a range of adaptive and virulence potentials. In contrast, selfing and other life history traits, such as asexual expansion of tissue-cysts by oral transmission among intermediate hosts, have been proposed to explain the genetic basis for the clonal population structure of T. gondii. In this study, we investigated the contributing roles self-mating and sexual recombination play in nature to maintain clonal population structures and produce or expand parasite clones capable of causing disease epidemics for two tissue encysting parasites. We applied high-resolution genotyping against strains isolated from a T. gondii waterborne outbreak that caused symptomatic disease in 155 immune-competent people in Brazil and a S. neurona outbreak that resulted in a mass mortality event in Southern sea otters. In both cases, a single, genetically distinct clone was found infecting outbreak-exposed individuals. Furthermore, the T. gondii outbreak clone was one of several apparently recombinant progeny recovered from the local environment. Since oocysts or sporocysts were the infectious form implicated in each outbreak, the expansion of the epidemic clone can be explained by self-mating. The results also show that out-crossing preceded selfing to produce the virulent T. gondii clone. For the tissue encysting coccidia, self-mating exists as a key adaptation potentiating the epidemic expansion and transmission of newly emerged parasite clones that can profoundly shape parasite population genetic structures or cause devastating disease outbreaks.
","The parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona have lifecycles that include a sexual stage in a definitive host and an asexual stage in intermediate hosts. For T. gondii, laboratory studies have demonstrated that the sexual stage can serve the dual purpose of producing new, virulent genotypes through recombination and promoting expansion of single clones via self-mating. Self-mating and other life history traits of T. gondii, including transmission of asexual stages among intermediate hosts, are assumed to account for the clonal population genetic structure of this organism. However, the relative contributions of sexual recombination and self-mating verses other life history traits in causing disease outbreaks or in shaping Toxoplasma's population genetic structure have not been verified in nature, nor have these traits been extensively examined in related parasites. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted population genetic analyses on T. gondii and S. neurona strains isolated from naturally occurring outbreaks affecting humans and sea otters, respectively. Our results identify self-mating as a key trait potentiating disease outbreaks through the rapid amplification of a single clone into millions of infectious units. Selfing is likely a key adaptation for enhancing transmission of recently emerged, recombinant clones and reshaping population genetic structures among the tissue-cyst coccidia.

"The genus Paracoccidioides consists of thermodymorphic fungi responsible for Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a systemic mycosis that has been registered to affect ~10 million people in Latin America. Biogeographical data subdivided the genus Paracoccidioides in five divergent subgroups, which have been recently classified as different species. Genomic sequencing of five Paracoccidioides isolates, representing each of these subgroups/species provided an important framework for the development of post-genomic studies with these fungi. However, functional annotations of these genomes have not been submitted to manual curation and, as a result, ~60–90% of the Paracoccidioides protein-coding genes (depending on isolate/annotation) are currently described as responsible for hypothetical proteins, without any further functional/structural description.
The present work reviews the functional assignment of Paracoccidioides genes, reducing the number of hypothetical proteins to ~25–28%. These results were compiled in a relational database called ParaDB, dedicated to the main representatives of Paracoccidioides spp. ParaDB can be accessed through a friendly graphical interface, which offers search tools based on keywords or protein/DNA sequences. All data contained in ParaDB can be partially or completely downloaded through spreadsheet, multi-fasta and GFF3-formatted files, which can be subsequently used in a variety of downstream functional analyses. Moreover, the entire ParaDB environment has been configured in a Docker service, which has been submitted to the GitHub repository, ensuring long-term data availability to researchers. This service can be downloaded and used to perform fully functional local installations of the database in alternative computing ecosystems, allowing users to conduct their data mining and analyses in a personal and stable working environment.
These new annotations greatly reduce the number of genes identified solely as hypothetical proteins and are integrated into a dedicated database, providing resources to assist researchers in this field to conduct post-genomic studies with this group of human pathogenic fungi.
","The genus Paracoccidioides comprises fungi responsible for Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a neglected tropical disease prevalent in South America that has been shown to affect approximately 10 million people and has great medical/social impact, since available treatments are poorly effective, frequently leading to relapses, chronic infections and sequelae. Genomic information available for five reference Paracoccidioides isolates could greatly assist researchers in developing new chemotherapeutic approaches against PCM, but usefulness of such data is limited, since ~60–90% of Paracoccidioides protein-coding genes (depending on isolate) are described as responsible for hypothetical proteins, without any functional/structural description. Such elevated number of hypothetical proteins is unexpected and probably derives from annotations performed solely by automated computing pipelines. This problem can be minimized by manual curation, when expert reviewers determine the functional designation of each gene, after comparing results derived from several reference databases. This work describes an effort to review the functional assignment of >40,000 genes, annotated across the five Paracoccidioides genomes mentioned above, which reduced the number of hypothetical proteins to ~25–28%, contributing to significantly increase quality and usefulness of such genomic information. These data have been compiled in a relational database named ParaDB, constituting an important resource for researchers in the field.

"It is often claimed that pair bonds preferentially form between individuals that resemble one another. Such assortative mating appears to be widespread throughout the animal kingdom. Yet it is unclear whether the apparent ubiquity of assortative mating arises primarily from mate choice (“like attracts like”), which can be constrained by same-sex competition for mates; from spatial or temporal separation; or from observer, reporting, publication, or search bias. Here, based on a conventional literature search, we find compelling meta-analytical evidence for size-assortative mating in birds (r = 0.178, 95% CI 0.142–0.215, 83 species, 35,591 pairs). However, our analyses reveal that this effect vanishes gradually with increased control of confounding factors. Specifically, the effect size decreased by 42% when we used previously unpublished data from nine long-term field studies, i.e., data free of reporting and publication bias (r = 0.103, 95% CI 0.074–0.132, eight species, 16,611 pairs). Moreover, in those data, assortative mating effectively disappeared when both partners were measured by independent observers or separately in space and time (mean r = 0.018, 95% CI −0.016–0.057). Likewise, we also found no evidence for assortative mating in a direct experimental test for mutual mate choice in captive populations of Zebra finches (r = −0.020, 95% CI −0.148–0.107, 1,414 pairs). These results highlight the importance of unpublished data in generating unbiased meta-analytical conclusions and suggest that the apparent ubiquity of assortative mating reported in the literature is overestimated and may not be driven by mate choice or mating competition for preferred mates.
","Research on mate choice in birds has attracted much attention, partly because many birds form monogamous pair bonds like humans do. Human mate choice is characterized by the phenomenon of “like attracts like,” meaning that partners resemble each other in multiple ways (“assortative mating”). Assortative mating is also frequently reported for birds, but it is unclear whether this in turn implies that birds also have preferences for a similar partner. Here, we show that a range of methodological issues may provide a simpler and more accurate explanation for the frequent observation of assortative mating in birds. First, studies that report assortative mating may achieve greater visibility than studies that yield no such finding. Hence, the scientific literature may be biased toward positive results. Second, in field studies, it is logistically impossible to measure all birds accurately and under standardized conditions. Hence, fluctuations in, for instance, environmental conditions may induce a spurious similarity between partners when these are measured together in space or time. After accounting for such methodological issues, we conclude that mate preferences for a similar partner may be less common than previously thought.

"Rhodopsins (Rhs) are light sensors, and Rh1 is the major Rh in the Drosophila photoreceptor rhabdomere membrane. Upon photoactivation, a fraction of Rh1 is internalized and degraded, but it remains unclear how the rhabdomeric Rh1 pool is replenished and what molecular players are involved. Here, we show that Crag, a DENN protein, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab11 that is required for the homeostasis of Rh1 upon light exposure. The absence of Crag causes a light-induced accumulation of cytoplasmic Rh1, and loss of Crag or Rab11 leads to a similar photoreceptor degeneration in adult flies. Furthermore, the defects associated with loss of Crag can be partially rescued with a constitutive active form of Rab11. We propose that upon light stimulation, Crag is required for trafficking of Rh from the trans-Golgi network to rhabdomere membranes via a Rab11-dependent vesicular transport.
","Animals sense light through receptors called Rhodopsins. These proteins are typically localized to stacked membranes in photoreceptors. In flies, upon light exposure, Rhodopsin undergoes conformational changes and becomes active as metarhodopsin. Metarhodopsin then initiates a signaling cascade that activates the photoreceptor cell. To deactivate the light response, metarhodopsin is converted back into Rhodopsin by absorption of another photon of light. Under certain conditions, metarhodopsin cannot be converted back to Rhodopsin, and it is then endocytosed and degraded. Rhodopsin then needs to be synthesized and delivered back to the membrane stacks. Here, we show that the Calmodulin-binding protein Crag is required for the delivery of newly made Rhodopsin to the membrane stacks. Loss of Crag leads to the accumulation of Rhodopsin in the cytosol, followed by shrinkage of membrane stack volume, and, eventually, photoreceptor cell degeneration. We also show that Crag activates a target protein, Rab11, which mediates the vesicular transport of Rhodospin to the membrane. Finally, we document that the human homolog of Crag, DENND4A, is able to rescue the loss of Crag in flies, suggesting that DENND4A functions in a similar process in vertebrates.

"Burkholderia pseudomallei, the bacterial agent of melioidosis, causes disease through inhalation of infectious particles, and is classified as a Tier 1 Select Agent. Optical diagnostic imaging has demonstrated that murine respiratory disease models are subject to significant upper respiratory tract (URT) colonization. Because human melioidosis is not associated with URT colonization as a prominent presentation, we hypothesized that lung-specific delivery of B. pseudomallei may enhance our ability to study respiratory melioidosis in mice. We compared intranasal and intubation-mediated intratracheal (IMIT) instillation of bacteria and found that the absence of URT colonization correlates with an increased bacterial pneumonia and systemic disease progression. Comparison of the LD50 of luminescent B. pseudomallei strain, JW280, in intranasal and IMIT challenges of albino C57BL/6J mice identified a significant decrease in the LD50 using IMIT. We subsequently examined the LD50 of both capsular polysaccharide and Type 3 Secretion System cluster 3 (T3SS3) mutants by IMIT challenge of mice and found that the capsule mutant was attenuated 6.8 fold, while the T3SS3 mutant was attenuated 290 fold, demonstrating that T3SS3 is critical to respiratory melioidosis. Our previously reported intranasal challenge studies, which involve significant URT colonization, did not identify a dissemination defect for capsule mutants; however, we now report that capsule mutants exhibit significantly reduced dissemination from the lung following lung-specific instillation, suggesting that capsule mutants are competent to spread from the URT, but not the lung. We also report that a T3SS3 mutant is defective for dissemination following lung-specific delivery, and also exhibits in vivo growth defects in the lung. These findings highlight the T3SS3 as a critical virulence system for respiratory melioidosis, not only in the lung, but also for subsequent spread beyond the lung using a model system uniquely capable to characterize the fate of lung-delivered pathogen.
","Respiratory melioidosis is a lethal disease presentation of the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is found in tropical regions worldwide. Respiratory melioidosis has also been highlighted as a concern in the biodefense community given the potential for weaponization of B. pseudomallei. This study demonstrates that respiratory melioidosis models can significantly vary in their disease presentations in mice, depending on whether the upper respiratory tract represents an initial site of infection. We have demonstrated that lung-specific infections of mice, which avoid nasal cavity colonization, result in a course of disease with greater maturation of pneumonia and systemic spread, and we propose that this represents a critical advance in the field of studying respiratory melioidosis. We further characterize that the capsule virulence determinant, previously considered important for respiratory melioidosis, has reduced significance when characterized in the context of lung-specific disease, while the Type 3 Secretion System cluster 3 is a critical virulence determinant for B. pseudomallei required for efficient colonization of the lung as well as spread to other tissues.

"Genetic reassortment of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) with currently circulating human influenza A strains is one possibility that could lead to efficient human-to-human transmissibility. Domestic pigs which are susceptible to infection with both human and avian influenza A viruses are one of the natural hosts where such reassortment events could occur. Virological, histological and serological features of H5N1 virus infection in pigs were characterized in this study. Two- to three-week-old domestic piglets were intranasally inoculated with 106 EID50 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN/04), A/chicken/Indonesia/7/03 (Ck/Indo/03), A/Whooper swan/Mongolia/244/05 (WS/Mong/05), and A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/ 209/05 (MDk/VN/05) viruses. Swine H3N2 and H1N1 viruses were studied as a positive control for swine influenza virus infection. The pathogenicity of the H5N1 HPAI viruses was also characterized in mouse and ferret animal models. Intranasal inoculation of pigs with H5N1 viruses or consumption of infected chicken meat did not result in severe disease. Mild weight loss was seen in pigs inoculated with WS/Mong/05, Ck/Indo/03 H5N1 and H1N1 swine influenza viruses. WS/Mong/05, Ck/Indo/03 and VN/04 viruses were detected in nasal swabs of inoculated pigs mainly on days 1 and 3. Titers of H5N1 viruses in nasal swabs were remarkably lower compared with those of swine influenza viruses. Replication of all four H5N1 viruses in pigs was restricted to the respiratory tract, mainly to the lungs. Titers of H5N1 viruses in the lungs were lower than those of swine viruses. WS/Mong/05 virus was isolated from trachea and tonsils, and MDk/VN/05 virus was isolated from nasal turbinate of infected pigs. Histological examination revealed mild to moderate bronchiolitis and multifocal alveolitis in the lungs of pigs infected with H5N1 viruses, while infection with swine influenza viruses resulted in severe tracheobronchitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Pigs had low susceptibility to infection with H5N1 HPAI viruses. Inoculation of pigs with H5N1 viruses resulted in asymptomatic to mild symptomatic infection restricted to the respiratory tract and tonsils in contrast to mouse and ferrets animal models, where some of the viruses studied were highly pathogenic and replicated systemically.
","Highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses of H5N1 subtype have spread through Eurasia and Africa with continuing cases of human infection, suggesting the potential to become a pandemic influenza virus. Pigs which are susceptible to infection with both human and avian influenza A viruses are one of the natural hosts where a pandemic virus could be produced. In this study, we characterized in a pig model the infection caused by four H5N1 virus strains isolated from humans, poultry and wild birds. We demonstrated that exposure of pigs through the nose with H5N1 viruses or consumption of meat from infected chickens resulted in infection with mild weight loss. In contrast to mouse and ferret animal models where some of viruses were highly pathogenic and replicated in multiple organs, replication of H5N1 viruses in pigs was restricted to the respiratory tract, mainly to the lungs, and tonsils. Mild to moderate bronchiolitis and pneumonia were observed in the lungs of infected animals. Our results demonstrated that domestic pigs had low susceptibility to infection and disease with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses.

"Scrub typhus is a febrile infection caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, which causes significant morbidity and mortality across the Asia-Pacific region. The control of this vector-borne disease is challenging due to humans being dead-end hosts, vertical maintenance of the pathogen in the vector itself, and a potentially large rodent reservoir of unclear significance, coupled with a lack of accurate diagnostic tests. Development of an effective vaccine is highly desirable. This however requires better characterization of the natural immune response of this neglected but important disease. Here we implement a novel IFN-γ ELISpot assay as a tool for studying O. tsutsugamushi induced cellular immune responses in an experimental scrub typhus rhesus macaque model and human populations. Whole cell antigen for O. tsutsugamushi (OT-WCA) was prepared by heat inactivation of Karp-strain bacteria. Rhesus macaques were infected intradermally with O. tsutsugamushi. Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from infected (n = 10) and uninfected animals (n = 5) were stimulated with OT-WCA, and IFN-γ secreting cells quantitated by ELISpot assay at five time points over 28 days. PBMC were then assayed from people in a scrub typhus-endemic region of Thailand (n = 105) and responses compared to those from a partially exposed population in a non-endemic region (n = 14), and to a naïve population in UK (n = 12). Mean results at Day 0 prior to O. tsutsugamushi infection were 12 (95% CI 0–25) and 15 (2–27) spot-forming cells (SFC)/106 PBMC for infected and control macaques respectively. Strong O. tsutsugamushi-specific IFN-γ responses were seen post infection, with ELISpot responses 20-fold higher than baseline at Day 7 (mean 235, 95% CI 200–270 SFC/106 PBMC), 105-fold higher at Day 14 (mean 1261, 95% CI 1,097–1,425 SFC/106 PBMC), 125-fold higher at Day 21 (mean 1,498, 95% CI 1,496–1,500 SFC/106 PBMC) and 118-fold higher at Day 28 (mean 1,416, 95% CI 1,306–1,527 SFC/106 PBMC). No significant change was found in the control group at any time point compared to baseline. Humans from a scrub typhus endemic region of Thailand had mean responses of 189 (95% CI 88–290) SFC/106 PBMC compared to mean responses of 40 (95% CI 9–71) SFC/106 PBMC in people from a non-endemic region and 3 (95% CI 0–7) SFC/106 PBMC in naïve controls. In summary, this highly sensitive assay will enable field immunogenicity studies and further characterization of the host response to O. tsutsugamushi, and provides a link between human and animal models to accelerate vaccine development.
","Scrub typhus is a disease caused by bacteria that invade cells in our immune system and blood vessels. It is transmitted by mites and is treatable with antibiotics. Unfortunately diagnosis is difficult and requires techniques that are not easily accessible everywhere. Currently, there is no scrub typhus vaccine available. In order to improve diagnostics and vaccine development in future, we need to better understand our immune response against these bacteria. In this study, we developed a test where these bacteria were killed and prepared by a new purification method to stimulate the immune cells in our blood -not antibodies. We evaluated this test in hospitalized patients with scrub typhus disease and also in non-human primates to study the responses over time. The test proved to be very accurate and useful to study natural immune responses, and we found differences in responses in areas where scrub typhus is common, compared to areas where it is not common. This test will allow us to investigate the immune response to scrub typhus more in-depth in the future, and will support the development of better diagnostic tests and vaccines against scrub typhus.

"Through their increased potential to be engaged and processed by dendritic cells (DCs), nanovaccines consisting of Poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with both antigenic moieties and adjuvants are attractive candidates for triggering specific defense mechanisms against intracellular pathogens. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the immunogenicity and prophylactic potential of a rationally designed multi-epitope peptide of Leishmania Cysteine Protease A (CPA160-189) co-encapsulated with Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) in PLGA NPs against L. infantum in BALB/c mice and identify immune markers correlated with protective responses.
The DCs phenotypic and functional features exposed to soluble (CPA160-189, CPA160-189+MPLA) or encapsulated in PLGA NPs forms of peptide and adjuvant (PLGA-MPLA, PLGA-CPA160-189, PLGA-CPA160-189+MPLA) was firstly determined using BALB/c bone marrow-derived DCs. The most potent signatures of DCs maturation were obtained with the PLGA-CPA160-189+MPLA NPs. Subcutaneous administration of PLGA-CPA160-189+MPLA NPs in BALB/c mice induced specific anti-CPA160-189 cellular and humoral immune responses characterized by T cells producing high amounts of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNFα and IgG1/IgG2a antibodies. When these mice were challenged with 2x107 stationary phase L. infantum promastigotes, they displayed significant reduced hepatic (48%) and splenic (90%) parasite load at 1 month post-challenge. This protective phenotype was accompanied by a strong spleen lymphoproliferative response and high levels of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNFα versus low IL-4 and IL-10 secretion. Although, at 4 months post-challenge, the reduced parasite load was preserved in the liver (61%), an increase was detected in the spleen (30%), indicating a partial vaccine-induced protection.
This study provide a basis for the development of peptide-based nanovaccines against leishmaniasis, since it reveals that vaccination with well-defined Leishmania MHC-restricted epitopes extracted from various immunogenic proteins co-encapsulated with the proper adjuvant or/and phlebotomine fly saliva multi-epitope peptides into clinically compatible PLGA NPs could be a promising approach for the induction of a strong and sustainable protective immunity.
","Leishmaniases are a wide spectrum of parasite diseases caused by different species of the genus Leishmania. Among them, visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of the disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Currently chemotherapeutic agents are highly toxic and suffer from extensive drug resistance. However, the development of a safe and effective vaccine has to deal with the complications erased from the different immune responses of the human population. It is suggested that a solution to that problem is the design of candidate vaccines containing appropriate multi-epitope peptides for the induction of protective immunity. Furthermore, the selection of proper adjuvant and biocompatible delivery systems for the peptide(s) chosen should enhance their immunogenic potential. Subsequently, for this work, we used a synthetic peptide designed to contain overlapping epitopes obtained from the sequence of a known immunogenic Leishmania protein, Cysteine Protease A (CPA). The peptide was selected to be delivered along with MPLA adjuvant co-encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles. The data presented in this study show the immunogenicity and the prophylactic potential of the proposed nanovaccine against L. infantum in the susceptible model of visceral leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice, further suggesting that rationally designed peptide-based nanovaccines are promising vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis.

"The Roma population is the largest transnational ethnic minority in Europe, characterized by a linguistic, cultural and historical heterogeneity. Comparative linguistics and genetic studies have placed the origin of European Roma in the Northwest of India. After their migration across Persia, they entered into the Balkan Peninsula, from where they spread into Europe, arriving in the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th century. Their particular demographic history has genetic implications linked to rare and common diseases. However, the South Asian source of the proto-Roma remains still untargeted and the West Eurasian Roma component has not been yet deeply characterized. Here, in order to describe both the South Asian and West Eurasian ancestries, we analyze previously published genome-wide data of 152 European Roma and 34 new Iberian Roma samples at a fine-scale and haplotype-based level, with special focus on the Iberian Roma genetic substructure. Our results suggest that the putative origin of the proto-Roma involves a Punjabi group with low levels of West Eurasian ancestry. In addition, we have identified a complex West Eurasian component (around 65%) in the Roma, as a result of the admixture events occurred with non-proto-Roma populations between 1270–1580. Particularly, we have detected the Balkan genetic footprint in all European Roma, and the Baltic and Iberian components in the Northern and Western Roma groups, respectively. Finally, our results show genetic substructure within the Iberian Roma, with different levels of West Eurasian admixture, as a result of the complex historical events occurred in the Peninsula.
","Human demographic processes and admixture events leave traceable footprints in the genomes of the populations and they can modulate the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Here, we aim to study the Roma people, an admixed population with a particular demographic history recognized as the largest ethnic minority in Europe. Previous studies suggest that they originated in South Asia 1,500 years ago and followed a diaspora towards Europe with extensive admixture with non-Roma West Eurasian groups. However, the genetic components of the Roma have not been deeply characterized. Our study reveals a common South Asian origin of all European Roma, closely related to a Punjabi group from Northwestern India. Through fine-scale haplotype-based methods, we describe a complex West Eurasian genetic component in the Roma groups, identifying a common Balkan ancestry and country-specific admixture footprints consistent with the dispersion through Europe. Our findings provide new insights into the demographic history and recent admixture events that have shaped the genetic composition of European Roma groups and could enable a better genetic characterization of complex disease in this population.

"In Drosophila melanogaster, the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex plays a key role in dosage compensation by stimulating expression of male X-chromosome genes. It consists of MSL proteins and two long noncoding RNAs, roX1 and roX2, that are required for spreading of the complex on the chromosome and are redundant in the sense that loss of either does not affect male viability. However, despite rapid evolution, both roX species are present in diverse Drosophilidae species, raising doubts about their full functional redundancy. Thus, we have investigated consequences of deleting roX1 and/or roX2 to probe their specific roles and redundancies in D. melanogaster. We have created a new mutant allele of roX2 and show that roX1 and roX2 have partly separable functions in dosage compensation. In larvae, roX1 is the most abundant variant and the only variant present in the MSL complex when the complex is transmitted (physically associated with the X-chromosome) in mitosis. Loss of roX1 results in reduced expression of the genes on the X-chromosome, while loss of roX2 leads to MSL-independent upregulation of genes with male-biased testis-specific transcription. In roX1 roX2 mutant, gene expression is strongly reduced in a manner that is not related to proximity to high-affinity sites. Our results suggest that high tolerance of mis-expression of the X-chromosome has evolved. We propose that this may be a common property of sex-chromosomes, that dosage compensation is a stochastic process and its precision for each individual gene is regulated by the density of high-affinity sites in the locus.
","In humans and fruit flies, females and males have different sets of sex chromosomes. This causes gene dosage differences that must be compensated for by adjusting the expression of most genes located on the X-chromosome. Long non-coding RNAs are central in this compensation and in fruit flies this is mediated by two non-coding RNAs, roX1 and roX2 which together with five proteins form the male-specific lethal complex. The complex recognizes and upregulates gene transcription on the male X-chromosome. While non-coding RNAs are are engaged in numerous biological processes and critical for compensation their precise functions remain elusive. To understand the function of long non-coding RNAs we analysed the expression of all genes in roX1, roX2 and roX1 roX2 mutants to explore the roles of long non-coding RNAs. These mutants have different impacts on the genome-wide expression. Our results also suggest that the X-chromosome is highly tolerant to mis-expression and we speculate that this tolerance evolved in parallel with compensation mechanisms and may be a common property of sex-chromosomes. We propose that dosage compensation is a stochastic process that depends on the distribution of specific binding sites which will be selected for and optimized depending on the genes’ individual expression levels.

"[PSI+] is an amyloid-based prion of Sup35p, a subunit of the translation termination factor. Prion “strains” or “variants” are amyloids with different conformations of a single protein sequence, conferring different phenotypes, but each relatively faithfully propagated. Wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates have SUP35 alleles that fall into three groups, called reference, Δ19, and E9, with limited transmissibility of [PSI+] between cells expressing these different polymorphs. Here we show that prion transmission pattern between different Sup35 polymorphs is prion variant-dependent. Passage of one prion variant from one Sup35 polymorph to another need not change the prion variant. Surprisingly, simple mitotic growth of a [PSI+] strain results in a spectrum of variant transmission properties among the progeny clones. Even cells that have grown for >150 generations continue to vary in transmission properties, suggesting that simple variant segregation is insufficient to explain the results. Rather, there appears to be continuous generation of a cloud of prion variants, with one or another becoming stochastically dominant, only to be succeeded by a different mixture. We find that among the rare wild isolates containing [PSI+], all indistinguishably “weak” [PSI+], are several different variants based on their transmission efficiencies to other Sup35 alleles. Most show some limitation of transmission, indicating that the evolved wild Sup35 alleles are effective in limiting the spread of [PSI+]. Notably, a “strong [PSI+]” can have any of several different transmission efficiency patterns, showing that “strong” versus “weak” is insufficient to indicate prion variant uniformity.
","The [PSI+] prion (infectious protein) of yeast is a self-propagating amyloid (filamentous protein polymer) of the Sup35 protein, a subunit of the translation termination factor. A single protein can form many biologically distinct prions, called prion variants. Wild yeast strains have three groups of Sup35 sequences (polymorphs), which partially block transmission of the [PSI+] prion from cell to cell. We find that [PSI+] variants (including the rare [PSI+] from wild yeasts) show different transmission patterns from one Sup35 sequence to another. Moreover, we find segregation of different prion variants on mitotic growth and evidence for generation of new variants with growth under non-selective conditions. This data supports the “prion cloud” model, that prions are not uniform structures but have an array of related self-propagating amyloid structures.

"Worldwide, the theory and practice of agricultural extension system have been dominated for almost half a century by Rogers' “diffusion of innovation theory”. In particular, the success of integrated pest management (IPM) extension programs depends on the effectiveness of IPM information diffusion from trained farmers to other farmers, an important assumption which underpins funding from development organizations. Here we developed an innovative approach through an agent-based model (ABM) combining social (diffusion theory) and biological (pest population dynamics) models to study the role of cooperation among small-scale farmers to share IPM information for controlling an invasive pest. The model was implemented with field data, including learning processes and control efficiency, from large scale surveys in the Ecuadorian Andes. Our results predict that although cooperation had short-term costs for individual farmers, it paid in the long run as it decreased pest infestation at the community scale. However, the slow learning process placed restrictions on the knowledge that could be generated within farmer communities over time, giving rise to natural lags in IPM diffusion and applications. We further showed that if individuals learn from others about the benefits of early prevention of new pests, then educational effort may have a sustainable long-run impact. Consistent with models of information diffusion theory, our results demonstrate how an integrated approach combining ecological and social systems would help better predict the success of IPM programs. This approach has potential beyond pest management as it could be applied to any resource management program seeking to spread innovations across populations.
","Food security of millions of people in the third world has faced a growing number of challenges in recent years including risks associated with emergent agricultural pests. Worldwide, the promotion of integrated pest management practices has been heavily promoted through participative methodologies relying on farmer cooperation to share pest control information. Recent studies have put into doubt the efficiency of such methodologies evoking our poor knowledge of farmers' perceptions, behavioral heterogeneity, and complex interaction with pest dynamics. While pest management programs have a larger place than ever on the international policy agenda, the debate concerning their efficiency at large scales has remained unresolved. Here, we developed an innovative modeling approach coupling pest control information diffusion and pest population dynamics to study the role of cooperation among farmers to share the information. We found that the slow learning process placed restrictions on the knowledge that could be generated within farmer communities over time, giving rise to natural lags in pest control diffusion and applications. However, our model also predicts that if individuals learn from others about the benefits of early prevention of invasive pests, then a temporary educational effort may have a sustainable long-run impact.

"The molecular determinants that render specific populations of normal cells susceptible to oncogenic reprogramming into self-renewing cancer stem cells are poorly understood. Here, we exploit T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model to define the critical initiating events in this disease. First, thymocytes that are reprogrammed by the SCL and LMO1 oncogenic transcription factors into self-renewing pre-leukemic stem cells (pre-LSCs) remain non-malignant, as evidenced by their capacities to generate functional T cells. Second, we provide strong genetic evidence that SCL directly interacts with LMO1 to activate the transcription of a self-renewal program coordinated by LYL1. Moreover, LYL1 can substitute for SCL to reprogram thymocytes in concert with LMO1. In contrast, inhibition of E2A was not sufficient to substitute for SCL, indicating that thymocyte reprogramming requires transcription activation by SCL-LMO1. Third, only a specific subset of normal thymic cells, known as DN3 thymocytes, is susceptible to reprogramming. This is because physiological NOTCH1 signals are highest in DN3 cells compared to other thymocyte subsets. Consistent with this, overexpression of a ligand-independent hyperactive NOTCH1 allele in all immature thymocytes is sufficient to sensitize them to SCL-LMO1, thereby increasing the pool of self-renewing cells. Surprisingly, hyperactive NOTCH1 cannot reprogram thymocytes on its own, despite the fact that NOTCH1 is activated by gain of function mutations in more than 55% of T-ALL cases. Rather, elevating NOTCH1 triggers a parallel pathway involving Hes1 and Myc that dramatically enhances the activity of SCL-LMO1 We conclude that the acquisition of self-renewal and the genesis of pre-LSCs from thymocytes with a finite lifespan represent a critical first event in T-ALL. Finally, LYL1 and LMO1 or LMO2 are co-expressed in most human T-ALL samples, except the cortical T subtype. We therefore anticipate that the self-renewal network described here may be relevant to a majority of human T-ALL.
","Deciphering the initiating events in lymphoid leukemia is important for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this manuscript, we define oncogenic reprogramming as the process through which non-self-renewing progenitors are converted into pre-leukemic stem cells with sustained self-renewal capacities. We provide strong genetic evidence that this step is rate-limiting in leukemogenesis and requires the activation of a self-renewal program by oncogenic transcription factors, as exemplified by SCL and LMO1. Furthermore, NOTCH1 is a pathway that drives cell fate in the thymus. We demonstrate that homeostatic NOTCH1 levels that are highest in specific thymocyte subsets determine their susceptibilities to oncogenic reprogramming by SCL and LMO1. Our data provide novel insight into the acquisition of self-renewal as a critical first step in lymphoid cell transformation, requiring the synergistic interaction of oncogenic transcription factors with a cellular context controlled by high physiological NOTCH1.

"The potential of broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the HIV-1 envelope trimer to prevent HIV-1 transmission has opened new avenues for therapies and vaccines. However, their implementation remains challenging and would profit from a deepened mechanistic understanding of HIV-antibody interactions and the mucosal transmission process. In this study we experimentally determined stoichiometric parameters of the HIV-1 trimer-antibody interaction, confirming that binding of one antibody is sufficient for trimer neutralization. This defines numerical requirements for HIV-1 virion neutralization and thereby enables mathematical modelling of in vitro and in vivo antibody neutralization efficacy. The model we developed accurately predicts antibody efficacy in animal passive immunization studies and provides estimates for protective mucosal antibody concentrations. Furthermore, we derive estimates of the probability for a single virion to start host infection and the risks of male-to-female HIV-1 transmission per sexual intercourse. Our work thereby delivers comprehensive quantitative insights into both the molecular principles governing HIV-antibody interactions and the initial steps of mucosal HIV-1 transmission. These insights, alongside the underlying, adaptable modelling framework presented here, will be valuable for supporting in silico pre-trial planning and post-hoc evaluation of HIV-1 vaccination or antibody treatment trials.
","Successful solicitation of the potential of neutralizing antibodies for HIV-1 prevention will require a deepened understanding of HIV-1 transmission and antibody neutralization. In this study, we experimentally determined molecular parameters of the HIV-1-antibody interaction, and subsequently used this knowledge to devise a mathematical model of HIV-1 infection and antibody neutralization in vivo. First, we experimentally confirmed that binding of one antibody per HIV-1 envelope trimer is sufficient for trimer neutralization. This finding, in combination with the number of trimers per HIV-1 virion, the number of trimers required for virus entry, and the affinity of antibody-trimer binding, enabled precise modelling of HIV-1 antibody neutralization. We employed our model for a post-hoc analysis of non-human primate infection studies, thereby obtaining estimates of HIV-1 neutralization in vivo and the probability for a single HIV-1 virion to initiate host infection. We further modelled HIV-1 infection and antibody neutralization during male-to-female transmission in the human host, which delivered estimates for the likelihood of HIV-1 transmission per sexual act and predictions of protective mucosal antibody concentrations. The quantitative insights into HIV-1 infection and antibody neutralization derived here, spanning from the molecular to the systemic level, contribute to a refined understanding of HIV-1 transmission and may prove useful for pre-study planning or post-hoc analyses of HIV-1 clinical trials and vaccine studies.

"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with dementia. The questions of whether the risk of dementia decreases over time after TBI, whether it is similar for different TBI types, and whether it is influenced by familial aggregation are not well studied.
The cohort considered for inclusion comprised all individuals in Sweden aged ≥50 years on December 31, 2005 (n = 3,329,360). Diagnoses of dementia and TBI were tracked through nationwide databases from 1964 until December 31, 2012. In a first cohort, individuals diagnosed with TBI (n = 164,334) were matched with up to two controls. A second cohort consisted of subjects diagnosed with dementia during follow-up (n = 136,233) matched with up to two controls. A third cohort consisted of 46,970 full sibling pairs with discordant TBI status. During a mean follow-up period of 15.3 (range, 0–49) years, 21,963 individuals in the first cohort (6.3% with TBI, 3.6% without TBI) were diagnosed with dementia (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75–1.86). The association was strongest in the first year after TBI (OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 3.23–3.84), but the risk remained significant >30 years (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11–1.41). Single mild TBI showed a weaker association with dementia (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57–1.70) than did more severe TBI (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.95–2.19) and multiple TBIs (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 2.51–3.15). These results were in general confirmed in the nested case-control cohort. TBI was also associated with an increased risk of dementia diagnosis in sibling pairs with discordant TBI status (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62–2.21). A main limitation of the present study is the observational design. Thus, no causal inferences can be made based on the associations found.
The risk of dementia diagnosis decreased over time after TBI, but it was still evident >30 years after the trauma. The association was stronger for more severe TBI and multiple TBIs, and it persisted after adjustment for familial factors.
","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in younger individuals. TBI has also been associated with the risk of dementia in older age.
However, the results from previous studies are not conclusive, there is lack of studies with long follow-up, and no study has evaluated whether familial factors may influence the association.
From all inhabitants living in Sweden above 50 years of age, three cohorts were formed. In the first cohort, 164,334 individuals with TBI were matched with controls; in the second case-control cohort, 136,233 individuals with dementia were matched with controls; and in the third cohort, 46,970 full sibling pairs discordant for TBI were evaluated for dementia during follow-up.
In the retrospective cohort and case-control cohort, the risk of dementia was increased by four to six times the first year after TBI. Thereafter, the risk decreased rapidly but was still significant more than 30 years after the TBI.
The risk of dementia was higher for those with a severe TBI or multiple TBIs, compared to those with one mild TBI.
The results were generally confirmed in the sibling cohort.
The risk of dementia is increased decades after a TBI; severe TBI or multiple TBIs increase the risk, compared to a mild TBI.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the associations found are causal.

"Biological systems evolved to be functionally robust in uncertain environments, but also highly adaptable. Such robustness is partly achieved by genetic redundancy, where the failure of a specific component through mutation or environmental challenge can be compensated by duplicate components capable of performing, to a limited extent, the same function. Highly variable environments require very robust systems. Conversely, predictable environments should not place a high selective value on robustness. Here we test this hypothesis by investigating the evolutionary dynamics of genetic redundancy in extremely reduced genomes, found mostly in intracellular parasites and endosymbionts. By combining data analysis with simulations of genome evolution we show that in the extensive gene loss suffered by reduced genomes there is a selective drive to keep the diversity of protein families while sacrificing paralogy. We show that this is not a by-product of the known drivers of genome reduction and that there is very limited convergence to a common core of families, indicating that the repertoire of protein families in reduced genomes is the result of historical contingency and niche-specific adaptations. We propose that our observations reflect a loss of genetic redundancy due to a decreased selection for robustness in a predictable environment.
","Bacteria have found many niches in which to live, and one of them is inside eukaryotic cells. These intracellular bacteria include endosymbionts like Buchnera aphidicola, which provides its host, an aphid, with essential amino acids, as well as many pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agents of leprosy and typhus, respectively. Even though they all evolved their intracellular lifestyle independently, all these bacteria lost a large number of genes as they adapted to their hosts, presumably because the rich environment where they found themselves no longer required such functions. For example, biosynthetic genes are frequently lost. It has been a matter of debate what decides whether a gene can be lost in evolution, and intracellular bacteria have been used as model systems to study these processes. In our study, we propose that when adopting an intracellular lifestyle, these bacteria extensively lost duplicated genes. We propose that this represents loss of copy redundancy that is possible because the host cell represents a predictable environment in which there is little pressure for the bacteria to retain these backups. In simplistic terms, if the road is always smooth, you are probably OK without a spare tire.

"Herpesviruses are large DNA viruses which depend on many nuclear functions, and therefore on host transport factors to ensure specific nuclear import of viral and host components. While some import cargoes bind directly to certain transport factors, most recruit importin β1 via importin α. We identified importin α1 in a small targeted siRNA screen to be important for herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) gene expression. Production of infectious virions was delayed in the absence of importin α1, but not in cells lacking importin α3 or importin α4. While nuclear targeting of the incoming capsids, of the HSV-1 transcription activator VP16, and of the viral genomes were not affected, the nuclear import of the HSV-1 proteins ICP4 and ICP0, required for efficient viral transcription, and of ICP8 and pUL42, necessary for DNA replication, were reduced. Furthermore, quantitative electron microscopy showed that fibroblasts lacking importin α1 contained overall fewer nuclear capsids, but an increased proportion of mature nuclear capsids indicating that capsid formation and capsid egress into the cytoplasm were impaired. In neurons, importin α1 was also not required for nuclear targeting of incoming capsids, but for nuclear import of ICP4 and for the formation of nuclear capsid assembly compartments. Our data suggest that importin α1 is specifically required for the nuclear localization of several important HSV1 proteins, capsid assembly, and capsid egress into the cytoplasm, and may become rate limiting in situ upon infection at low multiplicity or in terminally differentiated cells such as neurons.
","Nuclear pore complexes are highly selective gateways that penetrate the nuclear envelope for bidirectional trafficking between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. Viral and host cargoes have to engage specific transport factors to achieve active nuclear import and export. Like many human and animal DNA viruses, herpesviruses are critically dependent on many functions of the host cell nucleus. Alphaherpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) cause many diseases upon productive infection in epithelial cells, fibroblasts and neurons. Here, we asked which nuclear transport factors of the host cells help HSV-1 to translocate viral components into the nucleus for viral gene expression, nuclear capsid assembly, capsid egress into the cytoplasm, and production of infectious virions. Our data show that HSV-1 requires the nuclear import factor importin α1 for efficient replication and virus assembly in fibroblasts and in mature neurons. To our knowledge this is the first time that a specific importin α isoform is shown to be required for herpesvirus infection. Our study fosters our understanding on how the different but highly homologous importin α isoforms could fulfill specific functions in vivo which are only understood for a very limited number of host and viral cargos.

"RANTES (CCL5) is a chemokine expressed by many hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types that plays an important role in homing and migration of effector and memory T cells during acute infections. The RANTES receptor, CCR5, is a major target of anti-HIV drugs based on blocking viral entry. However, defects in RANTES or RANTES receptors including CCR5 can compromise immunity to acute infections in animal models and lead to more severe disease in humans infected with west Nile virus (WNV). In contrast, the role of the RANTES pathway in regulating T cell responses and immunity during chronic infection remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for RANTES in the control of systemic chronic LCMV infection. In RANTES−/− mice, virus-specific CD8 T cells had poor cytokine production. These RANTES−/− CD8 T cells also expressed higher amounts of inhibitory receptors consistent with more severe exhaustion. Moreover, the cytotoxic ability of CD8 T cells from RANTES−/− mice was reduced. Consequently, viral load was higher in the absence of RANTES. The dysfunction of T cells in the absence of RANTES was as severe as CD8 T cell responses generated in the absence of CD4 T cell help. Our results demonstrate an important role for RANTES in sustaining CD8 T cell responses during a systemic chronic viral infection.
","Chemokines are small proteins that attract cells and play complex roles in coordinating immune responses. RANTES is one such chemokine that attracts many different cell types. The receptor for RANTES, CCR5, is also a coreceptor for HIV and drugs blocking the RANTES∶CCR5 pathway are in clinical use to treat HIV-infected individuals. Despite the importance of CCR5 during HIV infection, the role of RANTES during other chronic infections remains poorly defined. In this study, we found that the absence of RANTES limited the ability of mice to control chronic LCMV infection resulting in higher viral loads and more severe T cell exhaustion. Our data suggest that the impact of blocking the RANTES∶CCR5 pathway on the ability to control other chronic infections should be given careful consideration when treating HIV-infected individuals.

"Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) has spread to many urban centers worldwide. Dogs are considered the main reservoir of VL, because canine cases often precede the occurrence of human cases. Detection and euthanasia of serologically positive dogs is one of the primary VL control measures utilized in some countries, including Brazil. Using accurate diagnostic tests can minimize one undesirable consequence of this measure, culling false-positive dogs, and reduce the maintenance of false-negative dogs in endemic areas. In December 2011, the Brazilian Ministry of Health replaced the ELISA (EIE CVL) screening method and Indirect Immunofluorescence Test (IFI CVL) confirmatory method with a new protocol using the rapid DPP CVL screening test and EIE CVL confirmatory test. A study of diagnostic accuracy of these two protocols was done by comparing their performance using serum samples collected from a random sample of 780 dogs in an endemic area of VL. All samples were evaluated by culture and real time PCR; 766 out of the 780 dogs were tested using the previous protocol (IFI CVL + EIE CVL) and all 780 were tested using the current protocol (DPP CVL + EIE CVL). Performances of both diagnostic protocols were evaluated using a latent class variable as the gold standard. The current protocol had a higher specificity (0.98 vs. 0.95) and PPV (0.83 vs. 0.70) than the previous protocol, although sensitivity of these two protocols was similar (0.73). When tested using sera from asymptomatic animals, the current protocol had a much higher PPV (0.63 vs. 0.40) than the previous protocol (although the sensitivity of either protocol was the same, 0.71). Considering a range of theoretical CVL prevalences, the projected PPVs were higher for the current protocol than for the previous protocol for each theoretical prevalence value. The findings presented herein show that the current protocol performed better than previous protocol primarily by reducing false-positive results.

"The circadian clock coordinates physiology and metabolism. mTOR (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a major intracellular sensor that integrates nutrient and energy status to regulate protein synthesis, metabolism, and cell growth. Previous studies have identified a key role for mTOR in regulating photic entrainment and synchrony of the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Given that mTOR activities exhibit robust circadian oscillations in a variety of tissues and cells including the SCN, here we continued to investigate the role of mTOR in orchestrating autonomous clock functions in central and peripheral circadian oscillators. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches we show that mTOR regulates intrinsic clock properties including period and amplitude. In peripheral clock models of hepatocytes and adipocytes, mTOR inhibition lengthens period and dampens amplitude, whereas mTOR activation shortens period and augments amplitude. Constitutive activation of mTOR in Tsc2–/–fibroblasts elevates levels of core clock proteins, including CRY1, BMAL1 and CLOCK. Serum stimulation induces CRY1 upregulation in fibroblasts in an mTOR-dependent but Bmal1- and Period-independent manner. Consistent with results from cellular clock models, mTOR perturbation also regulates period and amplitude in the ex vivo SCN and liver clocks. Further, mTOR heterozygous mice show lengthened circadian period of locomotor activity in both constant darkness and constant light. Together, these results support a significant role for mTOR in circadian timekeeping and in linking metabolic states to circadian clock functions.

"The causes and mechanisms of evolutionary diversification are central issues in biology. Geographic isolation is the traditional explanation for diversification, but recent theoretical and empirical studies have shown that frequency-dependent selection can drive diversification without isolation and that adaptive diversification occurring in sympatry may be an important source of biological diversity. However, there are no empirical examples in which sympatric lineage splits have been understood at the genetic level, and it is unknown how predictable this process is—that is, whether similar ecological settings lead to parallel evolutionary dynamics of diversification. We documented the genetic basis and the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive diversification in three replicate evolution experiments, in which competition for two carbon sources caused initially isogenic populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli to diversify into two coexisting ecotypes representing different physiological adaptations in the central carbohydrate metabolism. Whole-genome sequencing of clones of each ecotype from different populations revealed many parallel and some unique genetic changes underlying the derived phenotypes, including changes to the same genes and sometimes to the same nucleotide. Timelines of allele frequencies extracted from the frozen “fossil” record of the three evolving populations suggest parallel evolutionary dynamics driven at least in part by a co-evolutionary process in which mutations causing one type of physiology changed the ecological environment, allowing the invasion of mutations causing an alternate physiology. This process closely corresponds to the evolutionary dynamics seen in mathematical models of adaptive diversification due to frequency-dependent ecological interactions. The parallel genetic changes underlying similar phenotypes in independently evolved lineages provide empirical evidence of adaptive diversification as a predictable evolutionary process.

The populations diversified into two coexisting ecotypes representing different physiological adaptations.

"Forward genetic screens in model organisms are an attractive means to identify those genes involved in any complex biological process, including neural circuit assembly. Although mutagenesis screens are readily performed to saturation, gene identification rarely is, being limited by the considerable effort generally required for positional cloning. Here, we apply a systematic positional cloning strategy to identify many of the genes required for neuronal wiring in the Drosophila visual system. From a large-scale forward genetic screen selecting for visual system wiring defects with a normal retinal pattern, we recovered 122 mutations in 42 genetic loci. For 6 of these loci, the underlying genetic lesions were previously identified using traditional methods. Using SNP-based mapping approaches, we have now identified 30 additional genes. Neuronal phenotypes have not previously been reported for 20 of these genes, and no mutant phenotype has been previously described for 5 genes. The genes encode a variety of proteins implicated in cellular processes such as gene regulation, cytoskeletal dynamics, axonal transport, and cell signalling. We conducted a comprehensive phenotypic analysis of 35 genes, scoring wiring defects according to 33 criteria. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining large-scale gene identification with large-scale mutagenesis in Drosophila, and provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms that regulate visual system wiring.
","In the nervous system, every neuronal process should know where to grow and when to establish contacts to the next-order neurons. During development, it is known that neural circuit formation is primarily determined by the genes. To identify these genes, we focused on the Drosophila visual circuitry as a model system, and disrupted the genes randomly. From over 30,000 of these mutants, we found more than 100 mutants which have disrupted patterns of neural circuitry, which we assessed as representing about 40 genes. We have successfully nailed down which gene is disrupted in 36 of them. We provide a list of all of the genes we identified. Altogether, we performed a detailed characterization of the 35 mutant phenotypes, to assess which aspects of neural circuit formation are disrupted in each of the mutants. Summarizing and categorizing the phenotypic fingerprints of each mutant, we could see which genes are more closely related to the others. These data will be useful for clarifying the genetic program that controls neural circuit formation, not only for the Drosophila visual system, but also generally for nervous systems across the species.

"A remarkable feature of the self-renewing population of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is their phenotypic heterogeneity: Nanog and other marker proteins of ESCs show large cell-to-cell variation in their expression level, which should significantly influence the differentiation process of individual cells. The molecular mechanism and biological implication of this heterogeneity, however, still remain elusive. We address this problem by constructing a model of the core gene-network of mouse ESCs. The model takes account of processes of binding/unbinding of transcription factors, formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus, and modification of histone code at each locus of genes in the network. These processes are hierarchically interrelated to each other forming the dynamical feedback loops. By simulating stochastic dynamics of this model, we show that the phenotypic heterogeneity of ESCs can be explained when the chromatin at the Nanog locus undergoes the large scale reorganization in formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus, which should have the timescale similar to the cell cycle period. With this slow transcriptional switching of Nanog, the simulated ESCs fluctuate among multiple transient states, which can trigger the differentiation into the lineage-specific cell states. From the simulated transitions among cell states, the epigenetic landscape underlying transitions is calculated. The slow Nanog switching gives rise to the wide basin of ESC states in the landscape. The bimodal Nanog distribution arising from the kinetic flow running through this ESC basin prevents transdifferentiation and promotes the definite decision of the cell fate. These results show that the distribution of timescales of the regulatory processes is decisively important to characterize the fluctuation of cells and their differentiation process. The analyses through the epigenetic landscape and the kinetic flow on the landscape should provide a guideline to engineer cell differentiation.
","Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can proliferate indefinitely by keeping pluripotency, i.e., the ability to differentiate into any cell-lineage. ESCs, therefore, have been the focus of intense biological and medical interests. A remarkable feature of ESCs is their phenotypic heterogeneity: ESCs show large cell-to-cell fluctuation in the expression level of Nanog, which is a key factor to maintain pluripotency. Since Nanog regulates many genes in ESCs, this fluctuation should seriously affect individual cells when they start differentiation. In this paper we analyze this phenotypic fluctuation by simulating the stochastic dynamics of gene network in ESCs. The model takes account of the mutually interrelated processes of gene regulation such as binding/unbinding of transcription factors, formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus, and histone-code modification. We show the distribution of timescales of these processes is decisively important to characterize the dynamical behavior of the gene network, and that the slow formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus at the Nanog locus explains the observed large fluctuation of ESCs. The epigenetic landscapes are calculated based on the stochastic simulation, and the role of the phenotypic fluctuation in the differentiation process is analyzed through the landscape picture.

"MPV17 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein whose dysfunction causes mitochondrial DNA abnormalities and disease by an unknown mechanism. Perturbations of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools are a recognized cause of mitochondrial genomic instability; therefore, we determined DNA copy number and dNTP levels in mitochondria of two models of MPV17 deficiency. In Mpv17 ablated mice, liver mitochondria showed substantial decreases in the levels of dGTP and dTTP and severe mitochondrial DNA depletion, whereas the dNTP pool was not significantly altered in kidney and brain mitochondria that had near normal levels of DNA. The shortage of mitochondrial dNTPs in Mpv17-/- liver slows the DNA replication in the organelle, as evidenced by the elevated level of replication intermediates. Quiescent fibroblasts of MPV17-mutant patients recapitulate key features of the primary affected tissue of the Mpv17-/- mice, displaying virtual absence of the protein, decreased dNTP levels and mitochondrial DNA depletion. Notably, the mitochondrial DNA loss in the patients’ quiescent fibroblasts was prevented and rescued by deoxynucleoside supplementation. Thus, our study establishes dNTP insufficiency in the mitochondria as the cause of mitochondrial DNA depletion in MPV17 deficiency, and identifies deoxynucleoside supplementation as a potential therapeutic strategy for MPV17-related disease. Moreover, changes in the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial deoxynucleotide homeostasis indicate a remodeling of nucleotide metabolism in MPV17 disease models, which suggests mitochondria lacking functional MPV17 have a restricted purine mitochondrial salvage pathway.
","Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by a decrease of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and decreased activities of respiratory chain enzymes. Depletion of mtDNA has been associated with mutations in several genes, which encode either proteins directly involved in mtDNA replication or factors regulating the homeostasis of the mitochondrial deoxynucleotide pool. However, for some genes the mechanism linking mutations and mtDNA depletion is not known. One such gene is MPV17, whose loss-of-function causes mtDNA abnormalities in human, mouse and yeast. Here we show that MPV17 dysfunction leads to a shortage of the precursors for DNA synthesis in the mitochondria, slowing DNA replication in the organelle. Not only does mtDNA copy number correlate with dNTP pool size in both mouse tissues and human cells, deoxynucleoside supplementation of the growth medium prevents depletion and restores mtDNA copy number in quiescent MPV17-deficient cells. Hence, our study links MPV17 deficiency, insufficiency of mitochondrial dNTPs, and slow replication in mitochondria to depletion of mtDNA manifesting in the human disease, and places MPV17-related disease firmly in the category of mtDNA disorders caused by deoxynucleotide perturbation. The prevention and reversal of mtDNA loss in MPV17 patient-derived cells identifies potential therapeutic strategy for a currently untreatable disease.

"Chromosomal organization in 3D plays a central role in regulating cell-type specific transcriptional and DNA replication timing programs. Yet it remains unclear to what extent the resulting long-range contacts depend on specific molecular drivers. Here we propose a model that comprehensively assesses the influence on contacts of DNA-binding proteins, cis-regulatory elements and DNA consensus motifs. Using real data, we validate a large number of predictions for long-range contacts involving known architectural proteins and DNA motifs. Our model outperforms existing approaches including enrichment test, random forests and correlation, and it uncovers numerous novel long-range contacts in Drosophila and human. The model uncovers the orientation-dependent specificity for long-range contacts between CTCF motifs in Drosophila, highlighting its conserved property in 3D organization of metazoan genomes. Our model further unravels long-range contacts depending on co-factors recruited to DNA indirectly, as illustrated by the influence of cohesin in stabilizing long-range contacts between CTCF sites. It also reveals asymmetric contacts such as enhancer-promoter contacts that highlight opposite influences of the transcription factors EBF1, EGR1 or MEF2C depending on RNA Polymerase II pausing.
","Chromosomal DNA is tightly packed in three dimensions (3D) such that a 2-meter long human genome can fit into a microscopic nucleus. Recent studies have revealed that such packing of DNA is not random but instead structured into functional DNA loops. Those loops are essential to numerous key processes in the cell, such as genome expression and DNA replication. In addition, disruption of DNA loops can lead to genetic diseases and cancers. Understanding how DNA loops are formed and what are their molecular determinants is thus a fundamental issue. In this work, we propose a computational model to identify the molecular determinants of loops, including protein and DNA sequence. Most notably, the model offers insights in the different mechanistic scenarios behind loop formation. Using this model, we uncover numerous novel DNA loops and underlying mechanisms in Drosophila and human. We find that the orientation-dependent specificity between CTCF motifs is conserved in metazoans. We show how loops between DNA-binding proteins can be mediated by additional cofactors. Our analyses further reveal opposite influences of transcription factors depending on RNA Polymerase II pausing.

"In nature, microbes often need to ""decide"" which of several available nutrients to utilize, a choice that depends on a cell’s inherent preference and external nutrient levels. While natural environments can have mixtures of different nutrients, phenotypic variation in microbes’ decisions of which nutrient to utilize is poorly studied. Here, we quantified differences in the concentration of glucose and galactose required to induce galactose-responsive (GAL) genes across 36 wild S. cerevisiae strains. Using bulk segregant analysis, we found that a locus containing the galactose sensor GAL3 was associated with differences in GAL signaling in eight different crosses. Using allele replacements, we confirmed that GAL3 is the major driver of GAL induction variation, and that GAL3 allelic variation alone can explain as much as 90% of the variation in GAL induction in a cross. The GAL3 variants we found modulate the diauxic lag, a selectable trait. These results suggest that ecological constraints on the galactose pathway may have led to variation in a single protein, allowing cells to quantitatively tune their response to nutrient changes in the environment.
","In nature, microbes often need to decide which of many potential nutrients to consume. This decision making process is complex, involving both intracellular constraints and the organism’s perception of the environment. To begin to mimic the complexity of natural environments, we grew cells in mixtures of two sugars, glucose and galactose. We find that in mixed environments, the sugar concentration at which cells decides to induce galactose-utilizing (GAL) genes is highly variable in natural isolates of yeast. By analyzing crosses of phenotypically different strains, we identified a locus containing the galactose sensor, a gene that in theory could allow cells to tune their perception of the environment. We confirmed that the galactose sensor can explain upwards of 90% of the variation in the decision to induce GAL genes. Finally, we show that the variation in the galactose sensor can modulate the time required for cells to switch from utilizing glucose to galactose. Our results suggest that signaling pathways can be highly variable across strains and thereby might allow for rapid adaption in fluctuating environments.

"Populations of cells often switch states as a group to cope with environmental changes such as nutrient availability and cell density. Although the gene circuits that underlie the switches are well understood at the level of single cells, the ways in which such circuits work in concert among many cells to support group-level switches are not fully explored. Experimental studies of microbial quorum sensing show that group-level changes in cellular states occur in either a graded or an all-or-none fashion. Here, we show through numerical simulations and mathematical analysis that these behaviors generally originate from two distinct forms of bistability. The choice of bistability is uniquely determined by a dimensionless parameter that compares the synthesis and the transport of the inducing molecules. The role of the parameter is universal, such that it not only applies to the autoinducing circuits typically found in bacteria but also to the more complex gene circuits involved in transmembrane receptor signaling. Furthermore, in gene circuits with negative feedback, the same dimensionless parameter determines the coherence of group-level transitions from quiescence to a rhythmic state. The set of biochemical parameters in bacterial quorum-sensing circuits appear to be tuned so that the cells can use either type of transition. The design principle identified here serves as the basis for the analysis and control of cellular collective decision making.

"Amyloidosis describes a group of protein folding diseases in which amyloid proteins are abnormally deposited in organs and/or tissues as fine fibrils. Mouse senile amyloidosis is a disorder in which apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) deposits as amyloid fibrils (AApoAII) and can be transmitted from one animal to another both by the feces and milk excreted by mice with amyloidosis. Thus, mouse AApoAII amyloidosis has been demonstrated to be a “transmissible disease”. In this study, to further characterize the transmissibility of amyloidosis, AApoAII amyloid fibrils were injected into transgenic Apoa2cTg+/− and normal R1.P1-Apoa2c mice to induce AApoAII systemic amyloidosis. Two months later, AApoAII amyloid deposits were found in the skeletal muscles of amyloid-affected mice, primarily in the blood vessels and in the interstitial tissues surrounding muscle fibers. When amyloid fibrils extracted from the skeletal muscles were subjected to Western blot analysis, apoA-II was detected. Amyloid fibril fractions isolated from the muscles not only demonstrated the structure of amyloid fibrils but could also induce amyloidosis in young mice depending on its fibril conformation. These findings present a possible pathogenesis of amyloidosis: transmission of amyloid fibril conformation through muscle, and shed new light on the etiology involved in amyloid disorders.
","“Amyloidosis”, a group of protein folding diseases characterized by deposition of fine fibrils in tissues, is a common disorder of protein metabolism and can be acquired, inherited and/or age-associated. Recently, prion-like transmission has been found in various amyloidoses. AApoAII amyloid fibrils in mouse senile amyloidosis have exhibited transmissibility. For instance, ingested AApoAII amyloid fibrils, which were excreted from mice and contained in feces or milk, function as seeds for changing apoA-II amyloid precursor protein to the fibrillar form and cause mouse senile amyloidosis. However, transmissibility through other pathways has not yet been established. Here, we induced AApoAII systemic amyloidosis in transgenic Apoa2cTg+/− and normal R1.P1-Apoa2c mice to analyze the transmissibility of mouse senile amyloidosis through muscle tissues. In this study, we not only detected AApoAII deposited in various skeletal muscles, but also found that it could induce secondary transmission of AApoAII amyloidosis. This is the first evidence of transmission through skeletal muscles in non-prion systemic amyloidosis. This pathway of transmission provides new insight into the potential for food-borne pathogenesis and etiology of systemic amyloidosis.

"Exhausted CD8+ T cell responses during chronic viral infections are defined by a complex expression pattern of inhibitory receptors. However, very little information is currently available about the coexpression patterns of these receptors on human virus-specific CD8+ T cells and their correlation with antiviral functions, T cell differentiation and antigen recognition. We addressed these important aspects in a cohort of 38 chronically HCV infected patients and found a coexpression of inhibitory receptors such as 2B4, CD160 and KLRG1 in association with PD-1 in about half of the HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Importantly, this exhaustive phenotype was associated with low and intermediate levels of CD127 expression, an impaired proliferative capacity, an intermediate T cell differentiation stage and absence of sequence variations within the corresponding epitopes, indicating ongoing antigen triggering. In contrast, a low expression of inhibitory receptors by the remaining HCV-specific CD8+ T cells occurred in concert with a CD127hi phenotype, an early T cell differentiation stage and presence of viral sequence variations within the corresponding epitopes. In sum, these results suggest that T cell exhaustion contributes to the failure of about half of HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses and that it is determined by a complex interplay of immunological (e.g. T cell differentiation) and virological (e.g. ongoing antigen triggering) factors.
","About 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which may cause severe liver disease and liver cancer. Upon acute infection, only about 30% of patients are able to eliminate the virus spontaneously while about 70% of patients develop chronic infection. It is known that a successful immune response against HCV depends on virus-specific CD8+ T cells. However, during chronic infection, these cells are impaired in their antiviral function. In this study, we found that the exhaustion is characterized by the expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, 2B4, CD160 and KLRG1. Of note, the coexpression of these receptors depends on the ongoing recognition of the viral antigen and the maturation stage of the T cell. The remaining virus-specific T cell responses that are not exhausted do not recognize the virus present in the patients any more due to viral mutations, indicating viral escape. Thus, they fail to exert antiviral activity, although they share characteristics of fully functional memory T cells. In sum, we have found that T cell exhaustion contributes to the failure of about half of HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses and that it is determined by a complex interplay of immunological and virological factors. These findings will be important to consider in the design of new antiviral vaccination strategies.

"Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients often have reduced mass and strength of skeletal muscles, including the diaphragm, the primary muscle of respiration. Here we show that lack of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plays an intrinsic role in skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction. In normal murine and human skeletal muscle, CFTR is expressed and co-localized with sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins. CFTR–deficient myotubes exhibit augmented levels of intracellular calcium after KCl-induced depolarization, and exposure to an inflammatory milieu induces excessive NF-kB translocation and cytokine/chemokine gene upregulation. To determine the effects of an inflammatory environment in vivo, sustained pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was produced, and under these conditions diaphragmatic force-generating capacity is selectively reduced in Cftr−/− mice. This is associated with exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression as well as upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases (MuRF1 and atrogin-1) involved in muscle atrophy. We conclude that an intrinsic alteration of function is linked to the absence of CFTR from skeletal muscle, leading to dysregulated calcium homeostasis, augmented inflammatory/atrophic gene expression signatures, and increased diaphragmatic weakness during pulmonary infection. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for CFTR in skeletal muscle function that may have major implications for the pathogenesis of cachexia and respiratory muscle pump failure in CF patients.
","Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which acts as a chloride channel and also participates in the regulation of other ions and proteins. In most CF patients, the clinical course is dominated by lung disease and recurrent pulmonary bacterial infections. Many CF patients also have significant skeletal muscle wasting and weakness, and this can affect the most essential breathing muscle, the diaphragm. Although muscle wasting in CF has generally been attributed to factors such as reduced physical activity and poor nutrition, our study reveals an intrinsic defect of skeletal muscle function caused by the lack of CFTR. Hence, we show that CFTR is normally found in skeletal muscle fibers of humans and mice. In CF muscle cells lacking CFTR, abnormal elevations of calcium and inflammatory gene expression are found. In addition, during pulmonary infections, diaphragm muscles lacking CFTR show greater weakness and induction of genes which cause muscle atrophy. These findings extend our understanding of the factors leading to exercise limitation and disability in CF and also have implications for the pathogenesis of respiratory muscle failure in CF patients during lung infections.

"Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous follicles. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a gram-positive anareobic bacterium, plays a critical role in the development of these inflammatory lesions. This study aimed at determining whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by keratinocytes upon P. acnes infection, dissecting the mechanism of this production, and investigating how this phenomenon integrates in the general inflammatory response induced by P. acnes. In our hands, ROS, and especially superoxide anions (O2•−), were rapidly produced by keratinocytes upon stimulation by P. acnes surface proteins. In P. acnes-stimulated keratinocytes, O2•− was produced by NAD(P)H oxidase through activation of the scavenger receptor CD36. O2•− was dismuted by superoxide dismutase to form hydrogen peroxide which was further detoxified into water by the GSH/GPx system. In addition, P. acnes-induced O2•− abrogated P. acnes growth and was involved in keratinocyte lysis through the combination of O2•− with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrites. Finally, retinoic acid derivates, the most efficient anti-acneic drugs, prevent O2•− production, IL-8 release and keratinocyte apoptosis, suggesting the relevance of this pathway in humans.
","Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous follicles. It is the most common skin disease, affecting up to 80% of individuals at some point between the ages of 11 and 30 years. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) plays a role in the development of inflammatory acne lesions, but whether it causes inflammation by itself or through indirect mechanisms is not clear yet. Therefore, by exposing epidermal cells to P. acnes in vitro, we tested whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (oxidative burst) was involved in the inflammatory process. We found that one particular ROS, superoxide anion, was generated by epidermal cells following P. acnes stimulation. This phenomenon is associated with the production of a soluble pro inflammatory molecule, IL-8, and epidermal cell death. The abrogation of P. acnes-induced oxidative burst by the most commonly used and most efficient treatments of acne suggests that superoxide anions produced by epidermal cells are critical in the development of acne inflammatory lesions.

"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is one of the few oncogenic human viruses known to date. Its large genome encodes more than 85 proteins and includes both unique viral proteins as well as proteins conserved amongst herpesviruses. KSHV ORF20 is a member of the herpesviral core UL24 family, but the function of ORF20 and its role in the viral life cycle is not well understood. ORF20 encodes three largely uncharacterized isoforms, which we found were localized predominantly in the nuclei and nucleoli. Quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) identified numerous specific interacting partners of ORF20, including ribosomal proteins and the interferon-stimulated gene product (ISG) oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL). Both endogenous and transiently transfected OASL co-immunoprecipitated with ORF20, and this interaction was conserved among all ORF20 isoforms and multiple ORF20 homologs of the UL24 family in other herpesviruses. Characterization of OASL interacting partners by q-AP-MS identified a very similar interactome to that of ORF20. Both ORF20 and OASL copurified with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, and when they were co-expressed, they associated with polysomes. Although ORF20 did not have a global effect on translation, ORF20 enhanced RIG-I induced expression of endogenous OASL in an IRF3-dependent but IFNAR-independent manner. OASL has been characterized as an ISG with antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role for gammaherpesviruses was unknown. We show that OASL and ORF20 mRNA expression were induced early after reactivation of latently infected HuARLT-rKSHV.219 cells. Intriguingly, we found that OASL enhanced infection of KSHV. During infection with a KSHV ORF20stop mutant, however, OASL-dependent enhancement of infectivity was lost. Our data have characterized the interaction of ORF20 with OASL and suggest ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection.
","The herpesviruses are a family of large double-stranded DNA viruses that cause a variety of illnesses from chicken pox to cancer. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a cancer-causing herpesvirus and can lead to development of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a major form of cancer in HIV-positive patients. As for all herpesviruses, infection with KSHV is lifelong. Exactly how KSHV initiates and maintains its infection is still not well understood, but it must manipulate the host cell to establish favorable conditions. Likewise, the host has developed a complicated system to fight off invaders, which includes the production of interferon-stimulated gene products. We have now found that KSHV exploits one such host cell protein, the oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL). Rather than OASL acting as an antiviral protein as it does during many other viral infections, KSHV appears to have found a way to utilize OASL for its own benefit. The KSHV protein ORF20 interacts with OASL, they co-localize in nucleoli, and both ORF20 and OASL associate and purify with components of the cellular translational machinery. This may help viral infection by selectively controlling protein production.

"Embryonic development is tightly regulated by transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins. H3K4me3 is associated with active transcription and H3K27me3 with gene repression, while the combination of both keeps genes required for development in a plastic state. Here we show that deletion of the H3K4me2/3 histone demethylase Jarid1b (Kdm5b/Plu1) results in major neonatal lethality due to respiratory failure. Jarid1b knockout embryos have several neural defects including disorganized cranial nerves, defects in eye development, and increased incidences of exencephaly. Moreover, in line with an overlap of Jarid1b and Polycomb target genes, Jarid1b knockout embryos display homeotic skeletal transformations typical for Polycomb mutants, supporting a functional interplay between Polycomb proteins and Jarid1b. To understand how Jarid1b regulates mouse development, we performed a genome-wide analysis of histone modifications, which demonstrated that normally inactive genes encoding developmental regulators acquire aberrant H3K4me3 during early embryogenesis in Jarid1b knockout embryos. H3K4me3 accumulates as embryonic development proceeds, leading to increased expression of neural master regulators like Pax6 and Otx2 in Jarid1b knockout brains. Taken together, these results suggest that Jarid1b regulates mouse development by protecting developmental genes from inappropriate acquisition of active histone modifications.
","Histone modifications are involved in transcriptional regulation and thus affect cellular identity, differentiation, and development. We study the histone demethylase Jarid1b (Kdm5b/Plu1), as it has been reported to be highly expressed in several human cancers and therefore might present a novel target for anti-cancer therapies. To gain insights into the physiological role of Jarid1b, we have generated a Jarid1b knockout mouse. We show that loss of Jarid1b affects survival of newborn mice and that Jarid1b is required for the faithful development of several neural organs. To understand how Jarid1b regulates embryogenesis, we identified genes with increased H3K4me3 at a genome-wide scale as well as Jarid1b target genes during development. In Jarid1b knockout embryos, master regulators of neural development are expressed at higher levels, underscoring the importance of Jarid1b in transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we extend previous reports of overlapping Jarid1b and Polycomb target genes to show the functional relevance of this observation. Our results provide the first detailed analysis of the role of Jarid1b in normal development and provide a basis for further studies evaluating the contribution of Jarid1b to tumorigenesis.

"Evolution of biological sensory systems is driven by the need for efficient responses to environmental stimuli. A paradigm among prokaryotes is the chemotaxis system, which allows bacteria to navigate gradients of chemoattractants by biasing their run-and-tumble motion. A notable feature of chemotaxis is adaptation: after the application of a step stimulus, the bacterial running time relaxes to its pre-stimulus level. The response to the amino acid aspartate is precisely adapted whilst the response to serine is not, in spite of the same pathway processing the signals preferentially sensed by the two receptors Tar and Tsr, respectively. While the chemotaxis pathway in E. coli is well characterized, the role of adaptation, its functional significance and the ecological conditions where chemotaxis is selected, are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of adaptation in the climbing of gradients by E. coli. We first present theoretical arguments that highlight the mechanisms that control the efficiency of the chemotactic up-gradient motion. We discuss then the limitations of linear response theory, which motivate our subsequent experimental investigation of E. coli speed races in gradients of aspartate, serine and combinations thereof. By using microfluidic techniques, we engineer controlled gradients and demonstrate that bacterial fronts progress faster in equal-magnitude gradients of serine than aspartate. The effect is observed over an extended range of concentrations and is not due to differences in swimming velocities. We then show that adding a constant background of serine to gradients of aspartate breaks the adaptation to aspartate, which results in a sped-up progression of the fronts and directly illustrate the role of adaptation in chemotactic gradient-climbing.
","Biological sensory pathways are presumed to evolve for the processing of environmental information, yet quantitative evidence is scant. Chemotaxis allows bacteria to sense chemical gradients but their ecological distribution, e.g. whether natural gradients sensed by E. coli change slowly or rapidly in space and time, is unknown. That distribution matters, as it controls constraints and selective pressure acting on the pathway. We used microfluidic devices to generate controlled chemoattractant gradients and measure the speed of bacterial climbing of those gradients. We could thereby assay the impact of adaptation properties of the chemotaxis pathway onto the progression of gradient climbing. We specifically show that loss of adaptation, induced by adding a background of serine to gradients of aspartate, leads to a faster progression of the bacteria along the chemoattractant gradient. We finally discuss why our experiments suggest that ecological conditions are likely to involve chemoattractant profiles more complex than constant gradients usually considered in the laboratory.

"Advances in the computational identification of functional noncoding polymorphisms will aid in cataloging novel determinants of health and identifying genetic variants that explain human evolution. To date, however, the development and evaluation of such techniques has been limited by the availability of known regulatory polymorphisms. We have attempted to address this by assembling, from the literature, a computationally tractable set of regulatory polymorphisms within the ORegAnno database (http://www.oreganno.org). We have further used 104 regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms from this set and 951 polymorphisms of unknown function, from 2-kb and 152-bp noncoding upstream regions of genes, to investigate the discriminatory potential of 23 properties related to gene regulation and population genetics. Among the most important properties detected in this region are distance to transcription start site, local repetitive content, sequence conservation, minor and derived allele frequencies, and presence of a CpG island. We further used the entire set of properties to evaluate their collective performance in detecting regulatory polymorphisms. Using a 10-fold cross-validation approach, we were able to achieve a sensitivity and specificity of 0.82 and 0.71, respectively, and we show that this performance is strongly influenced by the distance to the transcription start site.
","Computational techniques are used in biology to prioritize DNA sequence variants (or polymorphisms) that may be responsible for population diversity and the manifestation of species-specific traits. Predominantly, they have been used to predict the class of polymorphisms that alter protein function through allele-specific changes to amino acid composition. However, polymorphisms that alter gene expression have been increasingly implicated in manifestation of similar traits. Prioritization of these polymorphisms is challenged, though, by the lack of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of gene regulation and the paucity of characterized regulatory polymorphisms. Our work attempts to address this issue by assembling a collection of regulatory polymorphisms from the existing literature. Furthermore, we use this collection to investigate and prioritize various properties that may be important for identifying novel regulatory polymorphisms.

"Population-scale genome sequencing allows the characterization of functional effects of a broad spectrum of genetic variants underlying human phenotypic variation. Here, we investigate the influence of rare and common genetic variants on gene expression patterns, using variants identified from sequencing data from the 1000 genomes project in an African and European population sample and gene expression data from lymphoblastoid cell lines. We detect comparable numbers of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) when compared to genotypes obtained from HapMap 3, but as many as 80% of the top expression quantitative trait variants (eQTVs) discovered from 1000 genomes data are novel. The properties of the newly discovered variants suggest that mapping common causal regulatory variants is challenging even with full resequencing data; however, we observe significant enrichment of regulatory effects in splice-site and nonsense variants. Using RNA sequencing data, we show that 46.2% of nonsynonymous variants are differentially expressed in at least one individual in our sample, creating widespread potential for interactions between functional protein-coding and regulatory variants. We also use allele-specific expression to identify putative rare causal regulatory variants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that outlier expression values can be due to rare variant effects, and we approximate the number of such effects harboured in an individual by effect size. Our results demonstrate that integration of genomic and RNA sequencing analyses allows for the joint assessment of genome sequence and genome function.
","The recent availability of almost fully sequenced human genomes by the 1000 genomes project allows the direct study of genetic variants that influence levels of gene expression in the cell. In this study, we explore the effect of rare and common variants on levels of gene expression. We show that the availability of a more comprehensive list of variants brings us closer to the likely causal variants, and we discuss their genomic and evolutionary properties. We also demonstrate the effects of variants that change splicing patterns or length of the protein product, the putative joint impacts of variants that affect gene expression, and those that affect protein structure. Finally, we show the impact of rare regulatory variants that cannot be detected by the conventional methodologies of association and require the interrogation of full genome sequencing and full transcriptome sequencing. These approaches bring us closer to the implementation of these data and methodologies to a direct clinical application.

"Microtubules (MTs) are pivotal for numerous eukaryotic processes ranging from cellular morphogenesis, chromosome segregation to intracellular transport. Execution of these tasks requires intricate regulation of MT dynamics. Here, we identify a new regulator of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe MT cytoskeleton: Asp1, a member of the highly conserved Vip1 inositol polyphosphate kinase family. Inositol pyrophosphates generated by Asp1 modulate MT dynamic parameters independent of the central +TIP EB1 and in a dose-dependent and cellular-context-dependent manner. Importantly, our analysis of the in vitro kinase activities of various S. pombe Asp1 variants demonstrated that the C-terminal phosphatase-like domain of the dual domain Vip1 protein negatively affects the inositol pyrophosphate output of the N-terminal kinase domain. These data suggest that the former domain has phosphatase activity. Remarkably, Vip1 regulation of the MT cytoskeleton is a conserved feature, as Vip1-like proteins of the filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans and the distantly related pathogenic basidiomycete Ustilago maydis also affect the MT cytoskeleton in these organisms. Consistent with the role of interphase MTs in growth zone selection/maintenance, all 3 fungal systems show aspects of aberrant cell morphogenesis. Thus, for the first time we have identified a conserved biological process for inositol pyrophosphates.
","Fungi are an extremely successful and diverse group of organisms ranging from the small single-celled yeasts to the indefinitely growing filamentous fungi. Polarized growth, where growth is restricted to defined regions, leads to the specific cell shape of yeast cells, as well as the very long hyphae of filamentous fungi. Fungal polar growth is controlled by an internal regulatory circuit of which the microtubule cytoskeleton comprises the transport road for numerous cargos needed for polarized growth. However, the microtubule cytoskeleton is not static, but a dynamic structure, which is modulated by microtubule-associated proteins and the interaction with other cellular structures. Our present analysis has identified a new regulator of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the fission yeast S. pombe: a member of the highly conserved Vip1 inositol polyphosphate kinase family. Vip1 proteins have a dual domain structure consisting of an N-terminal kinase domain which synthesizes inositol pyrophosphates and a C-terminal domain, which we show to negatively regulate the kinase output. Our results suggest that modulation of microtubule dynamics is correlated to Vip1 kinase activity. Importantly, polarized growth and microtubule dynamics were also modulated by Vip1 family members in A. nidulans and U. maydis thus uncovering a conserved biological role for inositol pyrophosphates.

"Tip growth has been studied in pollen tubes, root hairs, and fungal and oomycete hyphae and is the most widely distributed unidirectional growth process on the planet. It ensures spatial colonization, nutrient predation, fertilization, and symbiosis with growth speeds of up to 800 μm h−1. Although turgor-driven growth is intuitively conceivable, a closer examination of the physical processes at work in tip growth raises a paradox: growth occurs where biophysical forces are low, because of the increase in curvature in the tip. All tip-growing cells studied so far rely on the modulation of cell wall extensibility via the polarized excretion of cell wall–loosening compounds at the tip. Here, we used a series of quantitative measurements at the cellular level and a biophysical simulation approach to show that the brown alga Ectocarpus has an original tip-growth mechanism. In this alga, the establishment of a steep gradient in cell wall thickness can compensate for the variation in tip curvature, thereby modulating wall stress within the tip cell. Bootstrap analyses support the robustness of the process, and experiments with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) confirmed the active vesicle trafficking in the shanks of the apical cell, as inferred from the model. In response to auxin, biophysical measurements change in agreement with the model. Although we cannot strictly exclude the involvement of a gradient in mechanical properties in Ectocarpus morphogenesis, the viscoplastic model of cell wall mechanics strongly suggests that brown algae have evolved an alternative strategy of tip growth. This strategy is largely based on the control of cell wall thickness rather than fluctuations in cell wall mechanical properties.
","Tip growth is known in organisms with filament-like structures, such as fungi (e.g., hyphae), plants (e.g., root hairs, moss protonemata), and algae (e.g., filamentous thalli). The driving force for growth in these organisms is the difference in osmotic pressure (turgor) between the inside of the cell and the external medium, a force contained by the cell wall. Physical laws imply that the higher the curvature of the cell, the lower the pressure (stress) perceived by the cell wall. Paradoxically, growth takes place at the dome-shaped cell apex, which has high curvature. Tip-growing cells studied so far (mainly plants) compensate the low wall stress in the apex by chemically loosening their cell wall. We studied Ectocarpus, which is a representative of brown algae, a eukaryotic branch very divergent from land plants, fungi, and green algae. We carried out a series of quantitative measurements at the cellular level and showed that the cell wall is thinner at the tip (36 nm) than on the shanks (170 to 500 nm). Using a viscoplastic model of cell wall expansion, we showed that the cell wall thickness gradient, together with dome curvature, generates sufficient wall stress to account for the observed growth pattern.

"Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz to 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz to 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.
","Averaging brain activity across trials is a powerful way to increase signal-to-noise ratio in MEG data. This approach, however, potentially obscures meaningful brain dynamics that unfold on the single-trial level. Single-trial analyses have been successfully applied to time domain or low frequency oscillatory activity; its application to MEG high frequency activity is hindered by the low amplitude of these signals. In the present study, we show that stimulus modality (visual versus auditory presentation of words) can successfully be decoded from single-trial MEG high frequency activity by combining source reconstruction with a random forest classification algorithm. This approach reveals patterns of activity above 75 Hz in both visual and auditory cortex, highlighting the importance of high frequency activity for the processing of domain-specific stimuli. Thereby, our results extend prior findings by revealing high-frequency activity in auditory cortex related to auditory word stimuli in MEG data. The adopted across-subjects framework furthermore suggests a high inter-individual consistency in the high frequency activity patterns.

"Visual neuroscientists have discovered fundamental properties of neural representation through careful analysis of responses to controlled stimuli. Typically, different properties are studied and modeled separately. To integrate our knowledge, it is necessary to build general models that begin with an input image and predict responses to a wide range of stimuli. In this study, we develop a model that accepts an arbitrary band-pass grayscale image as input and predicts blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses in early visual cortex as output. The model has a cascade architecture, consisting of two stages of linear and nonlinear operations. The first stage involves well-established computations—local oriented filters and divisive normalization—whereas the second stage involves novel computations—compressive spatial summation (a form of normalization) and a variance-like nonlinearity that generates selectivity for second-order contrast. The parameters of the model, which are estimated from BOLD data, vary systematically across visual field maps: compared to primary visual cortex, extrastriate maps generally have larger receptive field size, stronger levels of normalization, and increased selectivity for second-order contrast. Our results provide insight into how stimuli are encoded and transformed in successive stages of visual processing.
","Much has been learned about how stimuli are represented in the visual system from measuring responses to carefully designed stimuli. Typically, different studies focus on different types of stimuli. Making sense of the large array of findings requires integrated models that explain responses to a wide range of stimuli. In this study, we measure functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses in early visual cortex to a wide range of band-pass filtered images, and construct a computational model that takes the stimuli as input and predicts the fMRI responses as output. The model has a cascade architecture, consisting of two stages of linear and nonlinear operations. A novel component of the model is a nonlinear operation that generates selectivity for second-order contrast, that is, variations in contrast-energy across the visual field. We find that this nonlinearity is stronger in extrastriate areas V2 and V3 than in primary visual cortex V1. Our results provide insight into how stimuli are encoded and transformed in the visual system.

"The downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) is a filamentous oomycete that invades plant cells via sophisticated but poorly understood structures called haustoria. Haustoria are separated from the host cell cytoplasm and surrounded by an extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) of unknown origin. In some interactions, including Hpa-Arabidopsis, haustoria are progressively encased by host-derived, callose-rich materials but the molecular mechanisms by which callose accumulates around haustoria remain unclear. Here, we report that PLASMODESMATA-LOCATED PROTEIN 1 (PDLP1) is expressed at high levels in Hpa infected cells. Unlike other plasma membrane proteins, which are often excluded from the EHM, PDLP1 is located at the EHM in Hpa-infected cells prior to encasement. The transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of PDLP1 are sufficient to convey this localization. PDLP1 also associates with the developing encasement but this association is lost when encasements are fully mature. We found that the pdlp1,2,3 triple mutant is more susceptible to Hpa while overexpression of PDLP1 enhances plant resistance, suggesting that PDLPs enhance basal immunity against Hpa. Haustorial encasements are depleted in callose in pdlp1,2,3 mutant plants whereas PDLP1 over-expression elevates callose deposition around haustoria and across the cell surface. These data indicate that PDLPs contribute to callose encasement of Hpa haustoria and suggests that the deposition of callose at haustoria may involve similar mechanisms to callose deposition at plasmodesmata.
","Haustoria are specialised invasive structures that project from fungal or oomycete hyphae into host plant cells during infection, acting as sites for molecular exchange between host and pathogen. Haustoria are targets of plant defence responses, including the deposition of membranes and polysaccharides in an encasement structure that surrounds the haustorium. It is assumed that the encasement physically seals the haustorium off from the host cell. Here we have used cell biological and genetic approaches to reveal that the plasmodesmata-associated receptor-like protein PDLP1 plays a role in infection success of the Arabidopsis downy mildew pathogen, specifically in the development of the encasement. Using live cell imaging, we observed that PDLP1 relocates to the extra-haustorial membrane, and this is required for deposition of the polysaccharide callose in the encasement. This directly correlates pathogen success with the structure of the encasement, verifying the significance of the encasement in host defence. Further, our data pose the possibility that callose deposition at plasmodesmata and the haustorial encasement exploit similar mechanisms. Our findings shed light on plant defences at haustoria and how they inhibit pathogen success.

"Recurrent connections play an important role in cortical function, yet their exact contribution to the network computation remains unknown. The principles guiding the long-term evolution of these connections are poorly understood as well. Therefore, gaining insight into their computational role and into the mechanism shaping their pattern would be of great importance. To that end, we studied the learning dynamics and emergent recurrent connectivity in a sensory network model based on a first-principle information theoretic approach. As a test case, we applied this framework to a model of a hypercolumn in the visual cortex and found that the evolved connections between orientation columns have a ""Mexican hat"" profile, consistent with empirical data and previous modeling work. Furthermore, we found that optimal information representation is achieved when the network operates near a critical point in its dynamics. Neuronal networks working near such a phase transition are most sensitive to their inputs and are thus optimal in terms of information representation. Nevertheless, a mild change in the pattern of interactions may cause such networks to undergo a transition into a different regime of behavior in which the network activity is dominated by its internal recurrent dynamics and does not reflect the objective input. We discuss several mechanisms by which the pattern of interactions can be driven into this supercritical regime and relate them to various neurological and neuropsychiatric phenomena.
","The recurrent interactions among cortical neurons shape the representation of incoming information but the principles governing their evolution are yet unclear. We investigate the computational role of recurrent connections in the context of sensory processing. Specifically, we study a neuronal network model in which the recurrent connections evolve to optimize the information representation of the network. Interestingly, these networks tend to operate near a ""critical"" point in their dynamics, namely close to a phase of ""hallucinations"", in which non-trivial spontaneous patterns of activity evolve even without structured input. We provide insights into this behavior by applying the framework to a network of orientation selective neurons, modeling a processing unit in the primary visual cortex. Various scenarios, such as attenuation of the external inputs or increased plasticity, can lead such networks to cross the border into the supercritical phase, which may manifest as neurological and neuropsychiatric phenomena.

"Cotton bacterial blight (CBB), an important disease of (Gossypium hirsutum) in the early 20th century, had been controlled by resistant germplasm for over half a century. Recently, CBB re-emerged as an agronomic problem in the United States. Here, we report analysis of cotton variety planting statistics that indicate a steady increase in the percentage of susceptible cotton varieties grown each year since 2009. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strains from the current outbreak cluster with race 18 Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum (Xcm) strains. Illumina based draft genomes were generated for thirteen Xcm isolates and analyzed along with 4 previously published Xcm genomes. These genomes encode 24 conserved and nine variable type three effectors. Strains in the race 18 clade contain 3 to 5 more effectors than other Xcm strains. SMRT sequencing of two geographically and temporally diverse strains of Xcm yielded circular chromosomes and accompanying plasmids. These genomes encode eight and thirteen distinct transcription activator-like effector genes. RNA-sequencing revealed 52 genes induced within two cotton cultivars by both tested Xcm strains. This gene list includes a homeologous pair of genes, with homology to the known susceptibility gene, MLO. In contrast, the two strains of Xcm induce different clade III SWEET sugar transporters. Subsequent genome wide analysis revealed patterns in the overall expression of homeologous gene pairs in cotton after inoculation by Xcm. These data reveal important insights into the Xcm-G. hirsutum disease complex and strategies for future development of resistant cultivars.
","Cotton bacterial blight (CBB), caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum (Xcm), significantly limited cotton yields in the early 20th century but has been controlled by classical resistance genes for more than 50 years. In 2011, the pathogen re-emerged with a vengeance. In this study, we compare diverse pathogen isolates and cotton varieties to further understand the virulence mechanisms employed by Xcm and to identify promising resistance strategies. We generate fully contiguous genome assemblies for two diverse Xcm strains and identify pathogen proteins used to modulate host transcription and promote susceptibility. RNA-Sequencing of infected cotton reveals novel putative gene targets for the development of durable Xcm resistance. Together, the data presented reveal contributing factors for CBB re-emergence in the U.S. and highlight several promising routes towards the development of durable resistance including classical resistance genes and potential manipulation of susceptibility targets.

"The IκB kinase (IKK) complex is a key regulator of signal transduction pathways leading to the induction of NF-κB-dependent gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It therefore represents a major target for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutic drugs and may be targeted by pathogens seeking to diminish the host response to infection. Previously, the vaccinia virus (VACV) strain Western Reserve B14 protein was characterised as an intracellular virulence factor that alters the inflammatory response to infection by an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of B14 inhibited NF-κB activation in response to TNFα, IL-1β, poly(I:C), and PMA. In cells infected with VACV lacking gene B14R (vΔB14) there was a higher level of phosphorylated IκBα but a similar level of IκBα compared to cells infected with control viruses expressing B14, suggesting B14 affects IKK activity. Direct evidence for this was obtained by showing that B14 co-purified and co-precipitated with the endogenous IKK complex from human and mouse cells and inhibited IKK complex enzymatic activity. Notably, the interaction between B14 and the IKK complex required IKKβ but not IKKα, suggesting the interaction occurs via IKKβ. B14 inhibited NF-κB activation induced by overexpression of IKKα, IKKβ, and a constitutively active mutant of IKKα, S176/180E, but did not inhibit a comparable mutant of IKKβ, S177/181E. This suggested that phosphorylation of these serine residues in the activation loop of IKKβ is targeted by B14, and this was confirmed using Ab specific for phospho-IKKβ.
","Vaccinia virus (VACV) is the live vaccine used to eradicate smallpox and is also the most intensively studied poxvirus. Like many poxviruses, VACV produces a wide variety of proteins that inhibit parts of the host response to infection. Consequently, the virus can escape destruction by the immune system and be passed on to additional hosts. Here we report a new VACV immune evasion mechanism mediated by protein B14, a protein that contributes to virus virulence. B14 functions by interacting with a cellular protein called IKKβ, which is critical for mounting an innate immune response to infection, and also plays important roles in cancer and cell death. B14 prevents IKKβ being activated and consequently the cellular signaling pathway leading to activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is not induced. Without activation of NF-κB the host cell cannot produce other molecules that amplify the innate immune response to infection. This mechanism of action of B14 fits nicely with the observed increase in the host response to infection by a VACV strain lacking the B14R gene. Lastly, an increased understanding of how B14 inhibits IKKβ function may lead to development of novel drugs against this important cellular enzyme.

"IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its dynamic expression pattern is required for proper hematopoiesis. In collaboration with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, it promotes gene repression and activation. It remains to be clarified how IKAROS can support transcription activation while being associated with the HDAC-containing complex NuRD. IKAROS also binds to the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) at gene promoters. Here, we demonstrate that NuRD and P-TEFb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited to specific genes by IKAROS. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α (PP1α), an IKAROS-binding protein and P-TEFb activator, to CDK9. We show that an IKAROS mutant that is unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impedes normal differentiation of IkNULL hematopoietic progenitors. Finally, the knock-down of the NuRD subunit Mi2 reveals that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and thereby, promotes transcription elongation.
","Perturbation of the expression level of IKAROS, a transcription factor critical during hematopoiesis, is associated with malignant transformation in mice and humans. The importance of IKAROS expression levels for the control of target-gene regulation was addressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. The collaboration between IKAROS and the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex can promote gene activation or repression. IKAROS can also interact with the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) and the Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), an important P-TEFb regulator. Immunoaffinity purification of IKAROS interacting proteins and Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography analysis revealed a dynamic interaction between IKAROS, PP1 and the newly defined NuRD-P-TEFb complex. This complex can be targeted to specific genes in cells expressing high levels of IKAROS to promote productive transcription elongation. Based on our results we suggest that, in addition to P-TEFb, the NuRD complex and PP1 are required to facilitate transcription elongation of IKAROS-target genes and normal differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.

"The notion of attractor networks is the leading hypothesis for how associative memories are stored and recalled. A defining anatomical feature of such networks is excitatory recurrent connections. These “attract” the firing pattern of the network to a stored pattern, even when the external input is incomplete (pattern completion). The CA3 region of the hippocampus has been postulated to be such an attractor network; however, the experimental evidence has been ambiguous, leading to the suggestion that CA3 is not an attractor network. In order to resolve this controversy and to better understand how CA3 functions, we simulated CA3 and its input structures. In our simulation, we could reproduce critical experimental results and establish the criteria for identifying attractor properties. Notably, under conditions in which there is continuous input, the output should be “attracted” to a stored pattern. However, contrary to previous expectations, as a pattern is gradually “morphed” from one stored pattern to another, a sharp transition between output patterns is not expected. The observed firing patterns of CA3 meet these criteria and can be quantitatively accounted for by our model. Notably, as morphing proceeds, the activity pattern in the dentate gyrus changes; in contrast, the activity pattern in the downstream CA3 network is attracted to a stored pattern and thus undergoes little change. We furthermore show that other aspects of the observed firing patterns can be explained by learning that occurs during behavioral testing. The CA3 thus displays both the learning and recall signatures of an attractor network. These observations, taken together with existing anatomical and behavioral evidence, make the strong case that CA3 constructs associative memories based on attractor dynamics.
","A type of neural network called an “attractor network” is thought to underlie memory associations. Importantly, when such a network is presented with part of a memory, the network activity is attracted to the complete memory. However, it has been difficult to obtain clear experimental evidence for such attractor networks. Indeed, recent “morphing” experiments that were specifically designed to observe these attractor dynamics in the hippocampus did not obtain the expected results, leading to a controversy on the validity of the attractor hypothesis of memory. Here, we have built a computational model of the relevant hippocampal areas, including its core anatomical and physiological features, and through the use of large-scale computer simulations reveal in detail the physiological properties expected of the hippocampal attractor network during morphing experiments. We show that the experimental results obtained are actually those to be expected of an attractor network when the specifics of the experimental protocol are taken into account. Most importantly, the results directly demonstrate the attraction of CA3 activity to a stored pattern. Our results, together with previous behavioral and in vitro studies, provide strong evidence that CA3 is an attractor network for associative memory.

"The synaptonemal complex (SC), a tripartite proteinaceous structure that forms between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, is crucial for faithful chromosome segregation. Here we identify CRA-1, a novel and conserved protein that is required for the assembly of the central region of the SC during C. elegans meiosis. In the absence of CRA-1, central region components fail to extensively localize onto chromosomes at early prophase and instead mostly surround the chromatin at this stage. Later in prophase, central region proteins polymerize along chromosome axes, but for the most part fail to connect the axes of paired homologous chromosomes. This defect results in an inability to stabilize homologous pairing interactions, altered double-strand break (DSB) repair progression, and a lack of chiasmata. Surprisingly, DSB formation and repair are required to promote the polymerization of the central region components along meiotic chromosome axes in cra-1 mutants. In the absence of both CRA-1 and any one of the C. elegans homologs of SPO11, MRE11, RAD51, or MSH5, the polymerization observed along chromosome axes is perturbed, resulting in the formation of aggregates of the SC central region proteins. While radiation-induced DSBs rescue this polymerization in cra-1; spo-11 mutants, they fail to do so in cra-1; mre-11, cra-1; rad-51, and cra-1; msh-5 mutants. Taken together, our studies place CRA-1 as a key component in promoting the assembly of a tripartite SC structure. Moreover, they reveal a scenario in which DSB formation and repair can drive the polymerization of SC components along chromosome axes in C. elegans.
","Accurate meiotic chromosome segregation relies on homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination. Although formation of the “zipper-like” structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC) is critical for homologous chromosome synapsis in most sexually reproducing organisms, regulation of SC formation is still poorly understood. Previous studies revealed that whereas SC formation is dependent on the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in yeast, plants, and mammals, it is DSB-independent in flies and nematodes. Here we introduce CRA-1, a novel and conserved protein required for the formation of the SC in the nematode C. elegans. In cra-1 mutants, SC central region components for the most part fail to link homologous chromosome axes and stabilize homologous pairing interactions. As a result, crossover recombination is impaired and there is increased chromosome nondisjunction. Analysis of cra-1 mutants also reveals that DSB formation and repair can promote the assembly of SC proteins along chromosome axes. Therefore, we propose that CRA-1 promotes a productive SC assembly, and demonstrate, in our analysis of cra-1 mutants, an unanticipated interconnection between the recruitment of central region components onto chromosome axes and the recombination pathway in C. elegans.

"The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes creates a genetic condition favoring the invasion of sex-ratio meiotic drive elements, resulting in the biased transmission of one sex chromosome over the other, in violation of Mendel's first law. The molecular mechanisms of sex-ratio meiotic drive may therefore help us to understand the evolutionary forces shaping the meiotic behavior of the sex chromosomes. Here we characterize a sex-ratio distorter on the X chromosome (Dox) in Drosophila simulans by genetic and molecular means. Intriguingly, Dox has very limited coding capacity. It evolved from another X-linked gene, which also evolved de nova. Through retrotransposition, Dox also gave rise to an autosomal suppressor, not much yang (Nmy). An RNA interference mechanism seems to be involved in the suppression of the Dox distorter by the Nmy suppressor. Double mutant males of the genotype dox; nmy are normal for both sex-ratio and spermatogenesis. We postulate that recurrent bouts of sex-ratio meiotic drive and its subsequent suppression might underlie several common features observed in the heterogametic sex, including meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and achiasmy.
","Mendel's first law of genetics states that two alleles of a heterozygote are transmitted to the next generation at an equal ratio. The cornerstone of population genetics, this law states that the evolutionary fate of genetic variants is solely governed by their contribution to the good of their carriers. However, meiotic drive genes—which skew transmission in their own favor—can evolve under certain circumstances, even though they cause harm to the genome as a whole. Meiotic drive elements are often enriched on the two sex chromosomes (i.e., the X and the Y) because of a lack of recombination between them. Here we describe the genetic and molecular characterization of a meiotic drive distorter on the X chromosome in Drosophila simulans. This distorter apparently formed de nova from yet another new gene. To fight back against this harmful distorter, the D. simulans genome has evolved an ingenious mechanism based on DNA sequence homology. We postulate that repeated meiotic drive invasion and its suppression could be a major mechanism for genome evolution, underlying the ultimate cause for the inactivation of sex chromosome during meiosis and the occasional loss of recombination (achiasmy), which is observed only in the heterogametic (XY) sex.

"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) examine a large number of markers across the genome to identify associations between genetic variants and disease. Most published studies examine only single markers, which may be less informative than considering multiple markers and multiple genes jointly because genes may interact with each other to affect disease risk. Much knowledge has been accumulated in the literature on biological pathways and interactions. It is conceivable that appropriate incorporation of such prior knowledge may improve the likelihood of making genuine discoveries. Although a number of methods have been developed recently to prioritize genes using prior biological knowledge, such as pathways, most methods treat genes in a specific pathway as an exchangeable set without considering the topological structure of a pathway. However, how genes are related with each other in a pathway may be very informative to identify association signals. To make use of the connectivity information among genes in a pathway in GWAS analysis, we propose a Markov Random Field (MRF) model to incorporate pathway topology for association analysis. We show that the conditional distribution of our MRF model takes on a simple logistic regression form, and we propose an iterated conditional modes algorithm as well as a decision theoretic approach for statistical inference of each gene's association with disease. Simulation studies show that our proposed framework is more effective to identify genes associated with disease than a single gene–based method. We also illustrate the usefulness of our approach through its applications to a real data example.
","Statistical methods used in most GWAS are based on the analysis of single markers. Prior biological information about markers, genes, and pathways is not commonly incorporated in the detection of associated disease loci. Recently a number of methods have been developed to incorporate such information, and it has been shown that they may make use of prior biological knowledge in association analysis. However, most of these methods ignore the regulatory relationships and functional interactions among genes. In this article, we propose a statistical method that can explicitly model the interactions of genes in a neighborhood defined by the topology of a pathway. Simulation studies and a real data example show that the proposed method can improve the power of identifying associated genes when they are in the neighborhood of other genes whose association has been firmly established in previous studies.

"The operation of a health care facility, such as a cholera or Ebola treatment center in an emergency setting, results in the production of pathogen-laden wastewaters that may potentially lead to onward transmission of the disease. The research presented here evaluated the design and operation of a novel treatment system, successfully used by Médecins Sans Frontières in Haiti to disinfect CTC wastewaters in situ, eliminating the need for road haulage and disposal of the waste to a poorly-managed hazardous waste facility, thereby providing an effective barrier to disease transmission through a novel but simple sanitary intervention. The physico-chemical protocols eventually successfully treated over 600 m3 of wastewater, achieving coagulation/flocculation and disinfection by exposure to high pH (Protocol A) and low pH (Protocol B) environments, using thermotolerant coliforms as a disinfection efficacy index. In Protocol A, the addition of hydrated lime resulted in wastewater disinfection and coagulation/flocculation of suspended solids. In Protocol B, disinfection was achieved by the addition of hydrochloric acid, followed by pH neutralization and coagulation/flocculation of suspended solids using aluminum sulfate. Removal rates achieved were: COD >99%; suspended solids >90%; turbidity >90% and thermotolerant coliforms >99.9%. The proposed approach is the first known successful attempt to disinfect wastewater in a disease outbreak setting without resorting to the alternative, untested, approach of ‘super chlorination’ which, it has been suggested, may not consistently achieve adequate disinfection. A basic analysis of costs demonstrated a significant saving in reagent costs compared with the less reliable approach of super-chlorination. The proposed approach to in situ sanitation in cholera treatment centers and other disease outbreak settings represents a timely response to a UN call for onsite disinfection of wastewaters generated in such emergencies, and the ‘Coalition for Cholera Prevention and Control’ recently highlighted the research as meriting serious consideration and further study. Further applications of the method to other emergency settings are being actively explored by the authors through discussion with the World Health Organization with regards to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and with the UK-based NGO Oxfam with regards to excreta-borne disease management in the Philippines and Myanmar, as a component of post-disaster incremental improvements to local sanitation chains.
","When an outbreak of infectious disease occurs in a low-resource setting, the rapid construction of emergency healthcare facilities may significantly reduce mortality. The facilities also result in the generation of large volumes of highly contaminated fecal waste that represents a potential basis for further disease transmission. Infection protection and control strategies at healthcare facilities must therefore include measures to establish and maintain good water supplies, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Even where the pathogen of concern is not waterborne, health-care providers have a ‘duty-of-care’ to protect workers and neighboring communities from all excreta-borne diseases. In this study, the authors successfully demonstrated, for the first time, the in situ disinfection of wastewaters from cholera treatment centers during the Haiti cholera outbreak, using a low-cost physicochemical method. The approach is currently being adapted by NGOs to help manage human excreta in other emergency settings, including the current Ebola outbreak. Although the Ebola virus is relatively fragile, it may exist in high concentrations in the bodily fluids (including feces) of those with the disease. The approach to in situ disinfection of excreta described here may therefore support infection control in outbreaks of Ebola and other infectious diseases.

"Shoot branching is a major determinant of plant architecture and is regulated by both endogenous and environmental factors. BRANCHED1 (BRC1) is a central local regulator that integrates signals controlling shoot branching. So far, the regulation of BRC1 activity at the protein level is still largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that TIE1 (TCP interactor containing EAR motif protein 1), a repressor previously identified as an important factor in the control of leaf development, also regulates shoot branching by repressing BRC1 activity. TIE1 is predominantly expressed in young axillary buds. The gain-of-function mutant tie1-D produced more branches and the overexpression of TIE1 recapitulated the increased branching of tie1-D, while disruption of TIE1 resulted in lower bud activity and fewer branches. We also demonstrated that the TIE1 protein interacts with BRC1 in vitro and in vivo. Expression of BRC1 fused with the C-terminus of the TIE1 protein in wild type caused excessive branching similar to that observed in tie1-D and brc1 loss-of-function mutants. Transcriptome analyses revealed that TIE1 regulated about 30% of the BRC1-dependent genes, including the BRC1 direct targets HB21, HB40 and HB53. These results indicate that TIE1 acts as a positive regulator of shoot branching by directly repressing BRC1 activity. Thus, our results reveal that TIE1 is an important shoot branching regulator, and provide new insights in the post-transcriptional regulation of the TCP transcription factor BRC1.
","Shoot branching is a key factor that not only affects plant survival but also determines food productivity in crop species. BRANCHED1 (BRC1) integrates internal and external signals to determine shoot branching. However, the regulation of BRC1 at the protein level remains elusive. We found that TIE1 (TCP interactor containing EAR motif protein 1) plays an important role in the control of shoot branching in Arabidopsis. Higher TIE1 expression levels lead to bushier Arabidopsis plants. TIE1 directly interacts with BRC1 and represses BRC1 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, BRC1 downstream target genes are downregulated by TIE1. Our findings demonstrate that TIE1 acts as a key repressor of BRC1 activity and positively regulates shoot branching.

"Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), caused by Leishmania braziliensis, is the most important presentation of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) in Latin American. While the role of dogs as reservoirs of Leishmania infantum, and the clinic features of canine visceral leishmanisis are well described, little is known about the importance of dogs in the transmission of L. braziliensis to humans. In the present study, we determine the frequency of L. braziliensis infection in dogs with cutaneous and mucosal ulcers in an endemic area of CL. We also describe the clinical manifestations and histopathologic features, and determine if the parasites isolated from dogs are genetically similar to those found in humans.
This is a cross sectional study in which 61 dogs living in an endemic area of CL and presenting ulcerated lesions were evaluated. Detection of L. braziliensis DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in skin biopsies, serology and leishmania skin test (LST) with soluble L. braziliensis antigen were performed. The clinical and histopathologic features were described, and we compared the genotypic characteristics of isolates obtained from dogs and humans.
The sensitivity of the three tests together to detect exposure was 89% and the concordance between the tests was high. The skin lesions were most frequent in the ears, followed by scrotal sac. The PCR was positive in 41 (67%) of animals, and the lesions in the snout, followed by the scrotal sac and ears were the sites where parasite DNA was most detected. There were genotype similarities between L.braziliensis isolates from dogs and humans.
The high frequency of L. braziliensis infection in dogs with ulcers and the similarities between the isolates of L. braziliensis and cutaneous leishmaniasis in dogs and humans in an endemic area of TL, raise the possibility of an important role of dogs in the transmission chain of L. braziliensis.
","Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is the major clinical forms of tegumentary leishmaniasis. More than 1 million of people develop cutaneous leishmaniasis worldwide and Leishmania braziliensis is the main causal agent of the disease in Latin American. Wild and domestic animals play an important role in the maintenance of the parasites that are transmitted to humans by infected sandflies. There is no vaccine for leishmaniasis and control measures are not effective in part because it is not known the reservoirs of L. braziliensis. Here, we show that dogs, living in houses in an area of L. braziliensis transmission presented cutaneous and mucosal ulcers similar to the one presented by humans. In all the houses with canine CL there were active or past history of cases of human CL, and L. braziliensis isolated from dogs were genetically similar to the one from humans. These data are in favor of the participation of dogs in the transmission of L. braziliensis and may have a great importance in the control of the expansion of L. braziliensis infection.

"Dengue diagnosis is complex and until recently only specialized laboratories were able to definitively confirm dengue infection. Rapid tests are now available commercially making biological diagnosis possible in the field. The aim of this study was to evaluate a combined dengue rapid test for the detection of NS1 and IgM/IgG antibodies. The evaluation was made prospectively in the field conditions and included the study of the impact of its use as a point-of-care test for case management as well as retrospectively against a panel of well-characterized samples in a reference laboratory.
During the prospective study, 157 patients hospitalized for a suspicion of dengue were enrolled. In the hospital laboratories, the overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the NS1/IgM/IgG combination tests were 85.7%, 83.9%, 95.6% and 59.1% respectively, whereas they were 94,4%, 90.0%, 97.5% and 77.1% respectively in the national reference laboratory at Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. These results demonstrate that optimal performances require adequate training and quality assurance. The retrospective study showed that the sensitivity of the combined kit did not vary significantly between the serotypes and was not affected by the immune status or by the interval of time between onset of fever and sample collection. The analysis of the medical records indicates that the physicians did not take into consideration the results obtained with the rapid test including for care management and use of antibiotic therapy.
In the context of our prospective field study, we demonstrated that if the SD Bioline Dengue Duo kit is correctly used, a positive result highly suggests a dengue case but a negative result doesn't rule out a dengue infection. Nevertheless, Cambodian pediatricians in their daily practice relied on their clinical diagnosis and thus the false negative results obtained did not directly impact on the clinical management.
","Dengue is a potentially life-threatening viral disease. Symptoms are often not specific hence the importance to confirm the diagnosis during the early stage of the disease. Nevertheless, until recently only specialized laboratories were able to confirm dengue diagnosis. The discovery of the NS1 protein as a marker of infection has allowed the development of point-of-care tests for a rapid diagnosis confirmation. These tests have previously been evaluated by laboratories, but their performances have never been assessed in field conditions. In this study we evaluated the performance of SD Bioline Dengue Duo kit when tests were performed by hospital laboratories staff in a dengue hyper-endemic country. We also assessed the impact of the test results on the clinical management decision. The combination of NS1 test with antibodies detection improved the performance, though discordances on IgM and IgG results were observed between the hospitals and the national reference laboratories. Physicians treated patients according to their clinical diagnosis and did not take negative results into consideration.

"The IRG system of IFNγ-inducible GTPases constitutes a powerful resistance mechanism in mice against Toxoplasma gondii and two Chlamydia strains but not against many other bacteria and protozoa. Why only T. gondii and Chlamydia? We hypothesized that unusual features of the entry mechanisms and intracellular replicative niches of these two organisms, neither of which resembles a phagosome, might hint at a common principle. We examined another unicellular parasitic organism of mammals, member of an early-diverging group of Fungi, that bypasses the phagocytic mechanism when it enters the host cell: the microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Consistent with the known susceptibility of IFNγ-deficient mice to E. cuniculi infection, we found that IFNγ treatment suppresses meront development and spore formation in mouse fibroblasts in vitro, and that this effect is mediated by IRG proteins. The process resembles that previously described in T. gondii and Chlamydia resistance. Effector (GKS subfamily) IRG proteins accumulate at the parasitophorous vacuole of E. cuniculi and the meronts are eliminated. The suppression of E. cuniculi growth by IFNγ is completely reversed in cells lacking regulatory (GMS subfamily) IRG proteins, cells that effectively lack all IRG function. In addition IFNγ-induced cells infected with E. cuniculi die by necrosis as previously shown for IFNγ-induced cells resisting T. gondii infection. Thus the IRG resistance system provides cell-autonomous immunity to specific parasites from three kingdoms of life: protozoa, bacteria and fungi. The phylogenetic divergence of the three organisms whose vacuoles are now known to be involved in IRG-mediated immunity and the non-phagosomal character of the vacuoles themselves strongly suggests that the IRG system is triggered not by the presence of specific parasite components but rather by absence of specific host components on the vacuolar membrane.
","For some time we have studied an intracellular resistance system essential for mice to survive infection with the intracellular protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii, that is based on a family of proteins, immunity-related GTPases or IRG proteins. Immediately after the parasite enters a cell, IRG proteins accumulate on the membrane of the vacuole in which the organism resides. Within a few hours the vacuole membrane breaks down and the parasite dies. A puzzle is why this mechanism works on Toxoplasma, but only on one other organism among the many tested, namely the bacterial species, Chlamydia. What do these widely different parasites have in common that so many other bacteria and protozoa lack? Neither Toxoplasma nor Chlamydia is taken up by conventional phagocytosis. In this paper we suggest that this is an important clue by showing that a microsporidian, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a highly-divergent fungal parasite, which also invades cells bypassing phagocytosis, is resisted by the IRG system. Therefore, we propose here the “missing self” principle: IRG proteins bind to vacuolar membranes only in the absence of a host derived inhibitor that is present on phagosomal membranes but excluded from the plasma membrane invaginated by IRG target organisms during non-phagosomal entry.

"Inference about the causal structure that induces correlations between two traits can be achieved by combining genetic associations with a mediation-based approach, as is done in the causal inference test (CIT). However, we show that measurement error in the phenotypes can lead to the CIT inferring the wrong causal direction, and that increasing sample sizes has the adverse effect of increasing confidence in the wrong answer. This problem is likely to be general to other mediation-based approaches. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it can be performed using only summary level data from genome-wide association studies; second, it is less susceptible to bias in the presence of measurement error or unmeasured confounding. We apply the method to infer the causal direction between DNA methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate that, in general, DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms, and by horizontal pleiotropy. We emphasise that, where possible, implementing MR and appropriate sensitivity analyses alongside other approaches such as CIT is important to triangulate reliable conclusions about causality.
","Understanding the causal relationships between pairs of traits is crucial for unravelling the causes of disease. To this end, results from genome-wide association studies are valuable because if a trait is known to be influenced by a genetic variant then this knowledge can be used to test the trait’s causal influences on other traits and diseases. Here we discuss scenarios where the nature of the genetic association with the causal trait can lead existing causal inference methods to give the wrong direction of causality. We introduce a new method that can be applied to summary level data and is potentially less susceptible to problems such as measurement error, and apply it to evaluate the causal relationships between DNA methylation levels and gene expression. While our results show that DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, we point out that is it crucial to acknowledge that systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms could influence such conclusions.

"Parasites causing malaria need to migrate in order to penetrate tissue barriers and enter host cells. Here we show that the actin filament-binding protein coronin regulates gliding motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. Parasites lacking coronin show motility defects that impair colonization of the mosquito salivary glands but not migration in the skin, yet result in decreased transmission efficiency. In non-motile sporozoites low calcium concentrations mediate actin-independent coronin localization to the periphery. Engagement of extracellular ligands triggers an intracellular calcium release followed by the actin-dependent relocalization of coronin to the rear and initiation of motility. Mutational analysis and imaging suggest that coronin organizes actin filaments for productive motility. Using coronin-mCherry as a marker for the presence of actin filaments we found that protein kinase A contributes to actin filament disassembly. We finally speculate that calcium and cAMP-mediated signaling regulate a switch from rapid parasite motility to host cell invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics.
","Parasites causing malaria are transmitted by mosquitoes and need to migrate to cross tissue barriers. The form of the parasite transmitted by the mosquito, the so-called sporozoite, needs motility to enter the salivary glands, to migrate within the skin and to enter into blood capillaries and eventually hepatocytes, where the parasites differentiate into thousands of merozoites that invade red blood cells. Sporozoite motility is based on an actin-myosin motor, as is the case in many other eukaryotic cells. However, most eukaryotic cells move much slower than sporozoites. How these parasites reach their high speed is not clear but current evidence suggests that actin filaments need to be organized by either actin-binding proteins or membrane proteins that link the filaments to an extracellular substrate.
The present study explores the role of the actin filament-binding protein coronin in the motility of sporozoites of the rodent model parasite Plasmodium berghei. We found that the deletion of P. berghei coronin leads to defects in parasite motility and thus lower infection of mosquito salivary glands, which translates into less efficient transmission of the parasites. Our experiments suggest that coronin organizes actin filaments to achieve rapid and directional motility. We also identify two signaling pathways that converge to regulate actin filament dynamics and suggest that they play a role in switching the parasite from its motility mode to a cell invasion mode.

"A fundamental question in biology is how sharp boundaries of gene expression form precisely in spite of biological variation/noise. Numerous mechanisms position gene expression domains across fields of cells (e.g. morphogens), but how these domains are refined remains unclear. In some cases, domain boundaries sharpen through differential adhesion-mediated cell sorting. However, boundaries can also sharpen through cellular plasticity, with cell fate changes driven by up- or down-regulation of gene expression. In this context, we have argued that noise in gene expression can help cells transition to the correct fate. Here we investigate the efficacy of cell sorting, gene expression plasticity, and their combination in boundary sharpening using multi-scale, stochastic models. We focus on the formation of hindbrain segments (rhombomeres) in the developing zebrafish as an example, but the mechanisms investigated apply broadly to many tissues. Our results indicate that neither sorting nor plasticity is sufficient on its own to sharpen transition regions between different rhombomeres. Rather the two have complementary strengths and weaknesses, which synergize when combined to sharpen gene expression boundaries.
","In many developing systems, chemical gradients control the formation of segmental domains of gene expression, specifying distinct domains that go on to form different tissues and structures, in a concentration-dependent manner. These gradients are noisy however, raising the question of how sharply delineated boundaries between distinct segments form. It is crucial that developing systems be able to cope with stochasticity and generate well-defined boundaries between different segmented domains. Previous work suggests that cell sorting and cellular plasticity help sharpen boundaries between segments. However, it remains unclear how effective each of these mechanisms is and what their role in sharpening may be. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we construct a hybrid stochastic model to investigate these questions. We find that neither mechanism is sufficient on its own to sharpen boundaries between different segments. Rather, results indicate each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and that they work together synergistically to promote the development of precise, well defined segment boundaries. Formation of segmented rhombomeres in the zebrafish hindbrain, which later form different components of the central nervous system, is a motivating case for this study.

"Peptidyl-prolyl isomerases catalyze the conversion between cis and trans isomers of proline. The cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases is well known for being the target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin, used to combat organ transplant rejection. There is great interest in both the substrate specificity of these enzymes and the design of isoform-selective ligands for them. However, the dearth of available data for individual family members inhibits attempts to design drug specificity; additionally, in order to define physiological functions for the cyclophilins, definitive isoform characterization is required. In the current study, enzymatic activity was assayed for 15 of the 17 human cyclophilin isomerase domains, and binding to the cyclosporin scaffold was tested. In order to rationalize the observed isoform diversity, the high-resolution crystallographic structures of seven cyclophilin domains were determined. These models, combined with seven previously solved cyclophilin isoforms, provide the basis for a family-wide structure∶function analysis. Detailed structural analysis of the human cyclophilin isomerase explains why cyclophilin activity against short peptides is correlated with an ability to ligate cyclosporin and why certain isoforms are not competent for either activity. In addition, we find that regions of the isomerase domain outside the proline-binding surface impart isoform specificity for both in vivo substrates and drug design. We hypothesize that there is a well-defined molecular surface corresponding to the substrate-binding S2 position that is a site of diversity in the cyclophilin family. Computational simulations of substrate binding in this region support our observations. Our data indicate that unique isoform determinants exist that may be exploited for development of selective ligands and suggest that the currently available small-molecule and peptide-based ligands for this class of enzyme are insufficient for isoform specificity.

","Cyclophilins are proteins that catalyze the isomerization of prolines, interconverting this structurally important amino acid between cis and trans isomers. Although there are 17 cyclophilins in the human genome, the function of most cyclophilin isoforms is unknown. At least some members of this protein family are of interest for clinically relevant drug design, as they are targets of the drug cyclosporin, which is used as an immunosuppressant to treat patients following organ transplantation. The absence of a comprehensive picture of the similarities and differences between the different members of this protein family precludes effective and specific drug design, however. In the current study we undertake such a global structure∶function analysis. Using biochemical, structural, and computational methods we characterize the human cyclophilin family in detail and suggest that there is a previously overlooked region of these enzymes that contributes significantly to isoform diversity. We propose that this region may represent an important target for isoform-specific drug design.

"Gammaherpesvirus (GHV) pathogenesis is a complex process that involves productive viral replication, dissemination to tissues that harbor lifelong latent infection, and reactivation from latency back into a productive replication cycle. Traditional loss-of-function mutagenesis approaches in mice using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), a model that allows for examination of GHV pathogenesis in vivo, have been invaluable for defining requirements for specific viral gene products in GHV infection. But these approaches are insufficient to fully reveal how viral gene products contribute when the encoded protein facilitates multiple processes in the infectious cycle and when these functions vary over time and from one host tissue to another. To address this complexity, we developed an MHV68 genetic platform that enables cell-type-specific and inducible viral gene deletion in vivo. We employed this system to re-evaluate functions of the MHV68 latency-associated nuclear antigen (mLANA), a protein with roles in both viral replication and latency. Cre-mediated deletion in mice of loxP-flanked ORF73 demonstrated the necessity of mLANA in B cells for MHV68 latency establishment. Impaired latency during the transition from draining lymph nodes to blood following mLANA deletion also was observed, supporting the hypothesis that B cells are a major conduit for viral dissemination. Ablation of mLANA in infected germinal center (GC) B cells severely impaired viral latency, indicating the importance of viral passage through the GC for latency establishment. Finally, induced ablation of mLANA during latency resulted in complete loss of affected viral genomes, indicating that mLANA is critically important for maintenance of viral genomes during stable latency. Collectively, these experiments provide new insights into LANA homolog functions in GHV colonization of the host and highlight the potential of a new MHV68 genetic platform to foster a more complete understanding of viral gene functions at discrete stages of GHV pathogenesis.
","Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs), including the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, establish lifelong infections that can lead to cancer. Defining the functions of viral gene products in acute replication and chronic infection is important for understanding how these viruses cause disease. Infection of mice with the related GHV, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), provides a tractable small animal model for defining how viral gene products function in chronic infection and understanding how host factors limit disease. Here we describe the development of a new viral genetic platform that enables the targeted deletion of specific genes from the viral genome in discrete host cells or at distinct times during infection. We utilize this system to better define requirements for the conserved latency-associated nuclear antigen in MHV68 lytic replication and latency in mice. This work highlights the utility of this MHV68 genetic platform for defining mechanisms of GHV infection and disease.

"Starting in 2004, the standard regimen for treatment of Buruli ulcer (BU) recommended by the World Health Organization has been daily treatment for eight weeks with rifampin (RIF) and streptomycin. Based on recent clinical trials, treatment with an all-oral regimen of RIF and clarithromycin (CLR) may be an effective alternative. With the achievement of an all-oral regimen, a new goal is to find a regimen that can shorten the duration of treatment without compromising efficacy. We recently observed that increasing the dose of RIF from the standard 10 mg/kg dose to 20 or 40 mg/kg, or replacing RIF with the more potent long-acting rifamycin, rifapentine (RPT) at 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg increased the bactericidal activity of the RIF+CLR regimen in a mouse model of BU. We also recently showed that replacing CLR with clofazimine(CFZ) at 25 mg/kg may have greater sterilizing activity than the RIF+CLR regimen. Here, we demonstrate that combining high-dose rifamycins with CFZ at a lower dose of 12.5 mg/kg results in similar reductions in swelling, bacterial burden and mycolactone concentrations in mouse footpads compared to the standard regimens and more rapid sterilization of footpads as determined by the proportions of footpads harboring viable bacteria three months after completion of treatment. The potential of these high-dose rifamycin and CFZ combinations to shorten BU treatment to four weeks warrants evaluation in a clinical trial.

","Buruli ulcer, a neglected tropical skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is treatable since 2004 with antibiotics instead of surgery. Treatment with either rifampin plus streptomycin or, more recently, rifampin plus clarithromycin requires taking the drugs daily for 8 weeks. Streptomycin is administered by injection and may result in hearing loss. Clarithromycin often causes gastrointestinal discomfort. Our goal is to identify a regimen that is both shorter and associated with fewer side effects. Rifampin, previously an expensive drug, is well tolerated not only at the standard dose of 10 mg/kg but at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg. The related rifamycin, rifapentine, has a longer half-life and is also well tolerated. We tested in a mouse model of Buruli ulcer whether higher doses of these rifamycins together with clofazimine, a drug that has transient skin pigmentation side effects but no toxicities, could effectively reduce lesion size, the number of bacteria, and production of the mycolactone toxin, in a shorter time than that for the existing drug regimens. We found that treatment for 4 weeks with a high dose rifamycin plus clofazimine is as effective as 8 weeks of the current standard regimens of rifampin plus streptomycin or rifampin plus clarithromycin.

"RNA silencing plays a critical role in plant resistance against viruses. To counteract host defense, plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that interfere with the cellular silencing machinery through various mechanisms not always well understood. We examined the role of Mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) AC4 and showed that it is essential for infectivity but not for virus replication. It acts as a determinant of pathogenicity and counteracts virus induced gene silencing by strongly suppressing the systemic phase of silencing whereas it does not interfere with local production of siRNA. We demonstrate the ability of AC4 to bind native 21–25 nt siRNAs in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. While most of the known VSRs have cytoplasmic localization, we observed that despite its hydrophilic nature and the absence of trans-membrane domain, MYMV AC4 specifically accumulates to the plasma membrane (PM). We show that AC4 binds to PM via S-palmitoylation, a process of post-translational modification regulating membrane–protein interactions, not known for plant viral protein before. When localized to the PM, AC4 strongly suppresses systemic silencing whereas its delocalization impairs VSR activity of the protein. We also show that AC4 interacts with the receptor-like kinase (RLK) BARELY ANY MERISTEM 1 (BAM1), a positive regulator of the cell-to-cell movement of RNAi. The absolute requirement of PM localization for direct silencing suppression activity of AC4 is novel and intriguing. We discuss a possible model of action: palmitoylated AC4 anchors to the PM by means of palmitate to acquire the optimal conformation to bind siRNAs, hinder their systemic movement and hence suppress the spread of the PTGS signal in the plant.
","Plants have developed small RNA (siRNA)-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing as a defense mechanism against viruses. In response, plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that can interfere with various steps of the silencing pathway. Mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) is a plant bipartite geminivirus responsible for a devastating disease in some areas of tropics and sub-tropics where its natural host, Vigna mungo, is a staple food crop. We discovered that the MYMV-encoded AC4 protein is a determinant of pathogenicity, binds native 21–25 nt siRNAs in vitro, and counteracts virus induced gene silencing by strongly suppressing the systemic phase of silencing but not the local production of siRNA. MYMV AC4 undergoes palmitoylation, a post-translational modification never reported before for plant viral proteins that mediates specific localization of the protein to the plasma membrane (PM). Interestingly, palmitoylation and in turns PM localization is indispensable for direct VSR function of AC4. AC4 also binds the PM-located BAM1, a trigger of cell-to-cell spread of RNAi. Taken together our results suggest that AC4 has synergic mechanisms of action, based on the specific PM localization, to prevent spreading of antiviral RNAi silencing in not yet infected cells.

"Opportunistic infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be acute or chronic. While acute infections often spread rapidly and can cause tissue damage and sepsis with high mortality rates, chronic infections can persist for weeks, months, or years in the face of intensive clinical intervention. Remarkably, this diverse infectious capability is not accompanied by extensive variation in genomic content, suggesting that the genetic capacity to be an acute or a chronic pathogen is present in most P. aeruginosa strains. To investigate the genetic requirements for acute and chronic pathogenesis in P. aeruginosa infections, we combined high-throughput sequencing-mediated transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) and genome-wide insertion mutant fitness profiling (Tn-seq) to characterize gene expression and fitness determinants in murine models of burn and non-diabetic chronic wound infection. Generally we discovered that expression of a gene in vivo is not correlated with its importance for fitness, with the exception of metabolic genes. By combining metabolic models generated from in vivo gene expression data with mutant fitness profiles, we determined the nutritional requirements for colonization and persistence in these infections. Specifically, we found that long-chain fatty acids represent a major carbon source in both chronic and acute wounds, and P. aeruginosa must biosynthesize purines, several amino acids, and most cofactors during infection. In addition, we determined that P. aeruginosa requires chemotactic flagellar motility for fitness and virulence in acute burn wound infections, but not in non-diabetic chronic wound infections. Our results provide novel insight into the genetic requirements for acute and chronic P. aeruginosa wound infections and demonstrate the power of using both gene expression and fitness profiling for probing bacterial virulence.
","Soft tissue infections, such as those in burns, bed sores, and diabetic ulcers, are a significant healthcare and economic burden in the developed and developing world. The opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa can cause both acute and chronic infections, and the trajectory of these two types of infections is vastly different. We used high-throughput sequencing to profile P. aeruginosa genome-wide gene expression and mutant fitness during mouse model acute and non-diabetic chronic wound infections. Using these data, we show that wounds are nutrient-rich growth environments in which long-chain fatty acids are a primary source of carbon and energy. We also show that the ability to travel along spatio-chemical gradients by chemotaxis is critical for bacterial fitness and virulence in acute but not chronic infections. Our results demonstrate the utility of simultaneous mutant fitness and gene expression profiling to discover critical functions in complex growth environments.

"Theoretical and empirical investigations of search strategies typically have failed to distinguish the distinct roles played by density versus patchiness of resources. It is well known that motility and diffusivity of organisms often increase in environments with low density of resources, but thus far there has been little progress in understanding the specific role of landscape heterogeneity and disorder on random, non-oriented motility. Here we address the general question of how the landscape heterogeneity affects the efficiency of encounter interactions under global constant density of scarce resources. We unveil the key mechanism coupling the landscape structure with optimal search diffusivity. In particular, our main result leads to an empirically testable prediction: enhanced diffusivity (including superdiffusive searches), with shift in the diffusion exponent, favors the success of target encounters in heterogeneous landscapes.
","Understanding how animals search for food is crucial for animal ecology. Although much has been learned about the main aspects of the so-called foraging problem, some important questions still remain unanswered. In this work we address the issue of the relevance of heterogeneity in the resources distribution to efficient animal foraging behavior. Our results unveil the key mechanism coupling landscape heterogeneity dynamics with optimal search diffusivity. Indeed, although the effect of (global) resource density on animal foraging behavior is well documented, much less has been known about how spatiotemporal landscape heterogeneity affects the efficiency of encounter interactions by foraging organisms. In this sense, we propose a new empirically testable theoretical prediction on the dynamics (e.g. diffusion exponent) of foraging organisms in heterogeneous environments. We also show that the conditions in which Lévy strategies are optimal are much broader than previously considered.

"The transition of the mammalian cell from quiescence to proliferation is a highly variable process. Over the last four decades, two lines of apparently contradictory, phenomenological models have been proposed to account for such temporal variability. These include various forms of the transition probability (TP) model and the growth control (GC) model, which lack mechanistic details. The GC model was further proposed as an alternative explanation for the concept of the restriction point, which we recently demonstrated as being controlled by a bistable Rb-E2F switch. Here, through a combination of modeling and experiments, we show that these different lines of models in essence reflect different aspects of stochastic dynamics in cell cycle entry. In particular, we show that the variable activation of E2F can be described by stochastic activation of the bistable Rb-E2F switch, which in turn may account for the temporal variability in cell cycle entry. Moreover, we show that temporal dynamics of E2F activation can be recast into the frameworks of both the TP model and the GC model via parameter mapping. This mapping suggests that the two lines of phenomenological models can be reconciled through the stochastic dynamics of the Rb-E2F switch. It also suggests a potential utility of the TP or GC models in defining concise, quantitative phenotypes of cell physiology. This may have implications in classifying cell types or states.
","Mammalian cells enter the division cycle in response to appropriate growth signals. For each cell, the decision to do so is critically dependent on the interplay between environmental cues and the internal state of the cell and is influenced by random fluctuations in cellular processes. Indeed, experimental evidence indicates that cell cycle entry is highly variable from cell to cell, even within a clonal population. To account for such variability, a number of phenomenological models have been previously proposed. These models primarily fall into two types depending on their fundamental assumptions on the origin of the variability. “Transition probability” models presume that variability in cell cycle entry originates from the fact that entry in each individual cell is random but also governed by a fixed probability. In contrast, “growth-controlled” models assume that the growth rates across a population are variable and result in cells that are out of phase developmentally. While both kinds of models provide a good fit to experimental data, their lack of mechanistic details limits their predictive power and has led to unresolved debate between their practitioners. In this study, we developed a mechanistically based stochastic model of the temporal dynamics of activation of the E2F transcription factor, which is used here as a marker of the transition of cells from quiescence to active cell cycling. Using this model, we show that “transition probability” and “growth-controlled” models can be reconciled by incorporation of a small number of basic cellular parameters related to protein synthesis and turnover, protein modification, stochasticity, and the like. Essentially our work shows that each kind of phenomenological model holds true for describing a particular aspect of the cell cycle transition. We suggest that incorporation of basic cellular parameters in this manner into phenomenological models may constitute a broadly applicable approach to defining concise, quantitative phenotypes of cell physiology.

"Most mammalian genes often feature alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites and hence diverse 3’UTR lengths. Proliferating cells were reported to favor APA sites that result in shorter 3’UTRs. One consequence of such shortening is escape of mRNAs from targeting by microRNAs (miRNAs) whose binding sites are eliminated. Such a mechanism might provide proliferation-related genes with an expression gain during normal or cancerous proliferation. Notably, miRNA sites tend to be more active when located near both ends of the 3’UTR compared to those located more centrally. Accordingly, miRNA sites located near the center of the full 3’UTR might become more active upon 3'UTR shortening. To address this conjecture we performed 3' sequencing to determine the 3' ends of all human UTRs in several cell lines. Remarkably, we found that conserved miRNA binding sites are preferentially enriched immediately upstream to APA sites, and this enrichment is more prominent in pro-differentiation/anti-proliferative genes. Binding sites of the miR17-92 cluster, upregulated in rapidly proliferating cells, are particularly enriched just upstream to APA sites, presumably conferring stronger inhibitory activity upon shortening. Thus 3’UTR shortening appears not only to enable escape from inhibition of growth promoting genes but also to potentiate repression of anti-proliferative genes.
","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression. Typically they recognize a binding site in genes' sequences and exert a repressive effect. This scheme prescribes a regulatory network that determines which gene is regulated by which miRNA. Yet this is a static sequence-based scheme that might not support dynamic changes in network wiring. Can genes become subject to, or be released, from the regulation of a miRNA in a manner that depends on the physiological state of cells? Here we describe such a dynamic mechanism. It is established that miRNA regulation is often more effective when their binding sites reside near the end of the target mRNA or right after the coding sequence STOP codon. Thus, a site distant from the mRNA’s end might be latent as it will not bind efficiently its corresponding miRNA. Yet, in particular physiological states, e.g. cancer or rapidly proliferating cells, mRNA ends tend to become shortened. So far it was suggested that such shortening may serve to release proliferation-favoring genes from miRNA repression by eliminating their binding sites from the mRNA. We propose a mirror image, complementary mechanism that acts upon genes that need to be repressed during proliferation. Specifically, we propose that mRNA shortening can dynamically activate latent repressive miRNA binding sites by bringing the mRNA end close to them. We mapped the ends of all mRNAs in proliferating cells and found that cancer-enriched ends are strikingly positioned closely downstream to a high density of potentially latent binding sites, which are retained in the short mRNA but are now close to the new ends. This may enable such potentially latent miRNA sites to become dynamically activated upon proliferation. Remarkably, this mechanism targets preferentially pro-differentiation and antiproliferative genes, which are often repressed in cancer.

"The stress-activated protein kinase Gcn2 regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α. Gcn2 is activated in amino acid-deprived cells by binding of uncharged tRNA to the regulatory domain related to histidyl-tRNA synthetase, but the molecular mechanism of activation is unclear. We used a genetic approach to identify a key regulatory surface in Gcn2 that is proximal to the predicted active site of the HisRS domain and likely remodeled by tRNA binding. Mutations leading to amino acid substitutions on this surface were identified that activate Gcn2 at low levels of tRNA binding (Gcd- phenotype), while other substitutions block kinase activation (Gcn- phenotype), in some cases without altering tRNA binding by Gcn2 in vitro. Remarkably, the Gcn- substitutions increase affinity of the HisRS domain for the C-terminal domain (CTD), previously implicated as a kinase autoinhibitory segment, in a manner dampened by HisRS domain Gcd- substitutions and by amino acid starvation in vivo. Moreover, tRNA specifically antagonizes HisRS/CTD association in vitro. These findings support a model wherein HisRS-CTD interaction facilitates the autoinhibitory function of the CTD in nonstarvation conditions, with tRNA binding eliciting kinase activation by weakening HisRS-CTD association with attendant disruption of the autoinhibitory KD-CTD interaction.
","The survival of all living organisms depends on their capacity to adapt their gene expression program to variations in the environment. When subjected to various stresses, eukaryotic cells modulate general and gene-specific protein synthesis by phosphorylating the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single eIF2α kinase, Gcn2, activated by uncharged tRNAs that accumulate in amino acid starved cells, which bind to a regulatory domain homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS). Gcn2 also contains a C-terminal domain implicated in autoinhibition of Gcn2. Our findings identify a direct interaction between the CTD and a novel regulatory surface in the HisRS domain that is required for inhibition of Gcn2 function in non-starved cells, which is down-regulated by uncharged tRNA. The results further suggest that tRNA binding to the pseudo-active site in the HisRS domain remodels its proximal CTD-binding surface to weaken HisRS/CTD interaction and thereby release the autoinhibitory function of the CTD to activate kinase function. This study provides new molecular insights into how tRNA binding can modulate regulatory interactions among the HisRS, CTD, and kinase domains of Gcn2 to elicit kinase activation.

"Aedes aegypti is the most important vector of dengue fever in Brazil, where severe epidemics have recently taken place. Ae. aegypti in Brazil was the subject of an intense eradication program in the 1940s and 50s to control yellow fever. Brazil was the largest country declared free of this mosquito by the Pan-American Health Organization in 1958. Soon after relaxation of this program, Ae. aegypti reappeared in this country, and by the early 1980s dengue fever had been reported. The aim of this study is to analyze the present-day genetic patterns of Ae. aegypti populations in Brazil.
We studied the genetic variation in samples of 11 widely spread populations of Ae. aegypti in Brazil based on 12 well-established microsatellite loci. Our principal finding is that present-day Brazilian Ae. aegypti populations form two distinct groups, one in the northwest and one in the southeast of the country. These two groups have genetic affinities to northern South American countries and the Caribbean, respectively. This is consistent with what has been reported for other genetic markers such as mitochondrial DNA and allele frequencies at the insecticide resistance gene, kdr.
We conclude that the genetic patterns in present day populations of Ae. aegypti in Brazil are more consistent with a complete eradication of the species in the recent past followed by re-colonization, rather than the alternative possibility of expansion from residual pockets of refugia. At least two colonizations are likely to have taken place, one from northern South American countries (e.g., Venezuela) that founded the northwestern group, and one from the Caribbean that founded the southeastern group. The proposed source areas were never declared free of Ae. aegypti.
","The mosquito, Aedes aegypti, was historically very important as the major vector of yellow fever, whereas today it is most notorious for being the major transmitter of dengue fever. In the 1940s and 50s, the Pan-American Health Organization organized a campaign to eradicate Ae. aegypti from the New World. They were partly successful, with Brazil being the largest country to be declared free of Ae. aegypti. Within ten years of relaxation of control efforts, Ae. aegypti reappeared in Brazil and today is the vector of the most intense dengue epidemics in the New World. Here, we present population genetic data that are most consistent with the species having truly been eradicated from Brazil rather than simply pushed into small refugia as a consequence of the eradication campaign. The re-infestation most likely resulted from two sources: 1) from northern S. American countries like Venezuela into northwest Brazil and 2) from the Caribbean into the southeast of the country.

"Dengue virus (DENV) is a human pathogen and its etiology has been widely established. There are many interactions between DENV and human proteins that have been reported in literature. However, no publicly accessible resource for efficiently retrieving the information is yet available. In this study, we mined all publicly available dengue–human interactions that have been reported in the literature into a database called DenHunt. We retrieved 682 direct interactions of human proteins with dengue viral components, 382 indirect interactions and 4120 differentially expressed human genes in dengue infected cell lines and patients. We have illustrated the importance of DenHunt by mapping the dengue–human interactions on to the host interactome and observed that the virus targets multiple host functional complexes of important cellular processes such as metabolism, immune system and signaling pathways suggesting a potential role of these interactions in viral pathogenesis. We also observed that 7 percent of the dengue virus interacting human proteins are also associated with other infectious and non-infectious diseases. Finally, the understanding that comes from such analyses could be used to design better strategies to counteract the diseases caused by dengue virus. The whole dataset has been catalogued in a searchable database, called DenHunt (http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/DenHunt/).
","The ‘Dengue Human Interaction Database’, called DenHunt, available at http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/DenHunt/ was created to catalog all interactions between dengue viral and human components published in peer-reviewed literature. There are three types of dengue-human molecular interactions in the database: direct physical interactions between dengue virus and human components, indirect interactions of human proteins affecting viral replication with no current evidence of them directly interacting with the viral components, and differentially expressed genes in dengue infected cell lines or patients. DenHunt could be used to draw network maps of human-dengue relationships which would aid in understanding dengue viral pathogenesis and such knowledge in turn can reveal new strategies for inhibiting viral replication. We also demonstrate that DenHunt could be used to compare common and diverse mechanisms of pathogenesis caused by infectious and non-infectious diseases thereby help in understanding disease mechanisms in general.

"Human tumors that lack telomerase maintain telomeres by alternative lengthening mechanisms. Tumors can also form in telomerase-deficient mice; however, the genetic mechanism responsible for tumor growth without telomerase is unknown. In yeast, several different recombination pathways maintain telomeres in the absence of telomerase—some result in telomere maintenance with minimal effects on telomere length. To examine non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance in mammalian cells, we used primary cells and lymphomas from telomerase-deficient mice (mTR−/− and Eμmyc+mTR−/−) and CAST/EiJ mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. These cells were analyzed using pq-ratio analysis, telomere length distribution outliers, CO-FISH, Q-FISH, and multicolor FISH to detect subtelomeric recombination. Telomere length was maintained during long-term growth in vivo and in vitro. Long telomeres, characteristic of human ALT cells, were not observed in either late passage or mTR−/− tumor cells; instead, we observed only minimal changes in telomere length. Telomere length variation and subtelomeric recombination were frequent in cells with short telomeres, indicating that length maintenance is due to telomeric recombination. We also detected telomere length changes in primary mTR−/− cells that had short telomeres. Using mouse mTR+/− and human hTERT+/− primary cells with short telomeres, we found frequent length changes indicative of recombination. We conclude that telomere maintenance by non-telomerase mechanisms, including recombination, occurs in primary cells and is initiated by short telomeres, even in the presence of telomerase. Most intriguing, our data indicate that some non-telomerase telomere maintenance mechanisms occur without a significant increase in telomere length.
","Telomeres shorten with each cell division and are normally maintained by telomerase. Tumor cells typically up-regulate telomerase to maintain telomeres during rapid growth; however, some tumors lack telomerase and utilize alternative mechanisms to maintain the telomeres. Studies in yeast indicate that recombination contributes to telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase. To examine whether recombination contributes to non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance in mouse and human cells, we utilized mouse primary and tumor cells, which were genetically deleted for telomerase. In addition, we assayed human primary cells that had short telomeres due to reduced telomerase activity. Our data indicate that cells with short telomeres have an increased level of telomere recombination, which can occur in telomeric or subtelomeric regions. We also found that, in addition to tumor cells, primary cells can utilize non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance. Lastly, we found that, unlike human telomerase negative tumors, some mechanisms of telomere maintenance do not result in dramatic telomere lengthening. Thus, mammalian cells likely utilize several different non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance. These findings will be useful for understanding the process of telomere lengthening in various types of human tumors.

"Humans and other animals are able to discover underlying statistical structure in their environments and exploit it to achieve efficient and effective performance. However, such structure is often difficult to learn and use because it is obscure, involving long-range temporal dependencies. Here, we analysed behavioural data from an extended experiment with rats, showing that the subjects learned the underlying statistical structure, albeit suffering at times from immediate inferential imperfections as to their current state within it. We accounted for their behaviour using a Hidden Markov Model, in which recent observations are integrated with evidence from the past. We found that over the course of training, subjects came to track their progress through the task more accurately, a change that our model largely attributed to improved integration of past evidence. This learning reflected the structure of the task, decreasing reliance on recent observations, which were potentially misleading.
","Humans and other animals possess the remarkable ability to find and exploit patterns and structures in their experience of a complex and varied world. However, such structures are often temporally extended and latent or hidden, being only partially correlated with immediate observations of the world. This makes it essential to integrate current and historical information, and creates a challenging statistical and computational problem. Here, we examine the behaviour of rats facing a version of this challenge posed by a brain-stimulation reward task. We find that subjects learned the general structure of the task, but struggled when immediate observations were misleading. We captured this behaviour with a model in which subjects integrated evidence from recent observations together with evidence from the past. The subjects’ performance improved markedly over successive sessions, allowing them to overcome misleading observations. According to our model, this was made possible by more effective usage of past evidence to better determine the true state of the world.

"Bioluminescence techniques allow accurate monitoring of the circadian clock in single cells. We have analyzed bioluminescence data of Per gene expression in mouse SCN neurons and fibroblasts. From these data, we extracted parameters such as damping rate and noise intensity using two simple mathematical models, one describing a damped oscillator driven by noise, and one describing a self-sustained noisy oscillator. Both models describe the data well and enabled us to quantitatively characterize both wild-type cells and several mutants. It has been suggested that the circadian clock is self-sustained at the single cell level, but we conclude that present data are not sufficient to determine whether the circadian clock of single SCN neurons and fibroblasts is a damped or a self-sustained oscillator. We show how to settle this question, however, by testing the models' predictions of different phases and amplitudes in response to a periodic entrainment signal (zeitgeber).
","Earth's 24-h-rotation around its axis is mirrored in the circadian clock that resides within each of our cells, controlling expression of ∼10% of all genes. The circadian clock is constructed as a negative feedback loop, in which clock proteins inhibit their own synthesis. During the last decade, a picture has emerged in which each cell is a self-sustained circadian oscillator that runs even without synchronizing cues. Here, we investigated state-of-the-art single-cell bioluminescence recordings of clock gene expression. It turns out that these time series are very well described by low-dimensional models, enabling us to extract descriptive parameters that characterize each cell. We find that different cell types do not differ much in their dynamics. However, different mutations in core clock genes yield different dynamic characteristics. Furthermore, we could not statistically reject the idea that the cells are in fact damped oscillators driven by noise. We thus declare the question of whether the circadian clock is a damped or self-sustained oscillator still unresolved. Further, we propose a way to resolve this question by examining the frequency-dependent response of single cells to periodic stimuli. We will then be in a better position to understand how cells coordinate and synchronize their circadian rhythms.

"Marine ecosystems are changing rapidly as the oceans warm and become more acidic. The physical factors and the changes to ocean chemistry that they drive can all be measured with great precision. Changes in the biological composition of communities in different ocean regions are far more challenging to measure because most biological monitoring methods focus on a limited taxonomic or size range. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has the potential to solve this problem in biological oceanography, as it is capable of identifying a huge phylogenetic range of organisms to species level. Here we develop and apply a novel multi-gene molecular toolkit to eDNA isolated from bulk plankton samples collected over a five-year period from a single site. This temporal scale and level of detail is unprecedented in eDNA studies. We identified consistent seasonal assemblages of zooplankton species, which demonstrates the ability of our toolkit to audit community composition. We were also able to detect clear departures from the regular seasonal patterns that occurred during an extreme marine heatwave. The integration of eDNA analyses with existing biotic and abiotic surveys delivers a powerful new long-term approach to monitoring the health of our world’s oceans in the context of a rapidly changing climate.
","All environments contain genetic remnants of the life they contain and support. For example, samples collected from the ocean contain biological material such as microscopic organisms, shed cells, excrement and saliva—the DNA from which reveals the surrounding marine biodiversity. Environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches have the ability to identify marine species that are notoriously difficult to identify using morphology alone. Here we develop, and apply, a DNA ‘toolkit’ to five years of samples collected from a single site in the Indian ocean. It is rare to find a temporal series of samples of this duration that are also suitable for DNA analysis. We show that eDNA techniques have the capacity to monitor ocean biology in fine detail. We demonstrate how the biological communities of plankton and fish respond to normal seasonal changes and, more importantly, to that of an uncharacteristic heatwave. The methods embodied in this paper are applicable to marine studies across the globe and, as such, pave the way for the design of long-term monitoring programs using eDNA.

"The endemic cichlid fishes in Lake Victoria are a model system for speciation through adaptive radiation. Although the evolution of the sex-determination system may also play a role in speciation, little is known about the sex-determination system of Lake Victoria cichlids. To understand the evolution of the sex-determination system in these fish, we performed cytogenetic analysis in 11 cichlid species from Lake Victoria. B chromosomes, which are present in addition to standard chromosomes, were found at a high prevalence rate (85%) in these cichlids. In one species, B chromosomes were female-specific. Cross-breeding using females with and without the B chromosomes demonstrated that the presence of the B chromosomes leads to a female-biased sex ratio in this species. Although B chromosomes were believed to be selfish genetic elements with little effect on phenotype and to lack protein-coding genes, the present study provides evidence that B chromosomes have a functional effect on female sex determination. FISH analysis using a BAC clone containing B chromosome DNA suggested that the B chromosomes are derived from sex chromosomes. Determination of the nucleotide sequences of this clone (104.5 kb) revealed the presence of several protein-coding genes in the B chromosome, suggesting that B chromosomes have the potential to contain functional genes. Because some sex chromosomes in amphibians and arthropods are thought to be derived from B chromosomes, the B chromosomes in Lake Victoria cichlids may represent an evolutionary transition toward the generation of sex chromosomes.
","The diversity of sex chromosomes among animal species is well known, but how these sex chromosomes emerged during evolutionary history remains to be solved. One hypothesis for the origin of sex chromosomes is that a portion of the sex chromosome was derived from B chromosomes. In about 10% of eukaryotes, B chromosomes are found in addition to standard chromosomes (sex chromosomes and autosomes). B chromosomes have been thought to be selfish genetic elements with no functional effect on the phenotype of individuals and have been thought to lack protein-coding genes. Although B chromosomes share unique features with sex chromosomes, concrete evidence describing which B chromosomes have evolved to gain a function in sex determination has not been reported. In this study, we found that B chromosomes in one cichlid species from Lake Victoria have a functional effect on sex determination. Moreover, we found that they contained multiple protein-coding genes including morphogenetic related genes. These findings support the hypothesis that a portion of the sex chromosomes has been derived from B chromosomes and shed light on the study of the evolution of sex chromosomes.

"Phosphorylation is a pivotal regulatory mechanism for protein stability and activity in circadian clocks regardless of their evolutionary origin. It determines the speed and strength of molecular oscillations by acting on transcriptional activators and their repressors, which form negative feedback loops. In Drosophila, the CK2 kinase phosphorylates and destabilizes the PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) proteins, which inhibit CLOCK (CLK) transcriptional activity. Here we show that CK2 also targets the CLK activator directly. Downregulating the activity of the catalytic α subunit of CK2 induces CLK degradation, even in the absence of PER and TIM. Unexpectedly, the regulatory β subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme is not required for the regulation of CLK stability. In addition, downregulation of CK2α activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases per and tim transcription. These results indicate that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. Since the CK1 kinase promotes CLK degradation, we suggest that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2.
","The CK2 kinase is an ancient enzyme known to be at the heart of self-sustaining circadian clocks in animals, plants, and fungi. Circadian clocks are responsible for daily circadian rhythms in molecular, physiological, and behavioral processes. Their mechanism relies on transcriptional activators and repressors that constitute a feedback loop. The CLOCK (CLK) activator is required to initiate the transcription of the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes in the late day. The PER and TIM repressors accumulate in a delayed manner and translocate to the nucleus to repress their own gene. Degradation of these repressors allows the activator to start a new cycle. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the PER and TIM repressors targets them for degradation. Here we find that the CLK activator is also regulated by CK2. In contrast to PER and TIM, CLK is stabilized by CK2α phosphorylation; we also show that PER and TIM are dispensable for this stabilization of CLK. The identification of CK2–CLK protein complexes and the in vitro phosphorylation of CLK by CK2 hint at a direct action of the kinase on the activator. Although transcription factor stabilization is generally expected to be associated with increased activity, genetic analysis indicates that CK2 represses CLK. Hence CK2 phosphorylation seems to be a key signal for the transcriptional activator complex to adopt a proper activation state at a given point of the circadian cycle.

"Mutations in dystrophin can lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy or the more mild form of the disease, Becker muscular dystrophy. The hinge 3 region in the rod domain of dystrophin is particularly prone to deletion mutations. In-frame deletions of hinge 3 are predicted to lead to BMD, however the severity of disease can vary considerably. Here we performed extensive structure-function analyses of truncated dystrophins with modified hinges and spectrin-like repeats in mdx mice. We found that the polyproline site in hinge 2 profoundly influences the functional capacity of a microdystrophinΔR4-R23/ΔCT with a large deletion in the hinge 3 region. Inclusion of polyproline in microdystrophinΔR4-R23/ΔCT led to small myofibers (12% smaller than wild-type), Achilles myotendinous disruption, ringed fibers, and aberrant neuromuscular junctions in the mdx gastrocnemius muscles. Replacing hinge 2 of microdystrophinΔR4-R23/ΔCT with hinge 3 significantly improved the functional capacity to prevent muscle degeneration, increase muscle fiber area, and maintain the junctions. We conclude that the rigid α-helical structure of the polyproline site significantly impairs the functional capacity of truncated dystrophins to maintain appropriate connections between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix.
","Dystrophin functions like a large molecular spring between the muscle cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in order to protect the membrane from contraction-induced injury. Mutations in dystrophin can lead to a severe muscle wasting disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys. DMD patients are typically wheelchair bound by 9–13 years of age and die at approximately 30 years. There are also mutations within the dystrophin gene that lead to internal truncations of non-essential regions, such as the internal rod domain that leads to a mild form of the disease called Becker Muscular Dystrophy. However, these internal truncations frequently occur at a “hot spot” within the rod domain where the resulting disease severity is difficult to predict. Here we found that consecutive proline residues, that function much like a molecular ruler, can dramatically influence the function of these internally truncated dystrophins within skeletal muscles. Using this information, we designed a dystrophin mini-gene that can accommodate the limited packaging size of recombinant adeno-associated virus. This virus can deliver the dystrophin mini-gene to most muscles throughout a dystrophic mouse to prevent muscle degeneration and partially restore muscle function.

"Recent data shows that HIV-1 is characterised by variation in viral virulence factors that is heritable between infections, which suggests that viral virulence can be naturally selected at the population level. A trade-off between transmissibility and duration of infection appears to favour viruses of intermediate virulence. We developed a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of putative viral genotypes that differ in their virulence. As a proxy for virulence, we use set-point viral load (SPVL), which is the steady density of viral particles in blood during asymptomatic infection. Mutation, the dependency of survival and transmissibility on SPVL, and host effects were incorporated into the model. The model was fitted to data to estimate unknown parameters, and was found to fit existing data well. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters produced a model in which SPVL converged from any initial conditions to observed values within 100–150 years of first emergence of HIV-1. We estimated the 1) host effect and 2) the extent to which the viral virulence genotype mutates from one infection to the next, and found a trade-off between these two parameters in explaining the variation in SPVL. The model confirms that evolution of virulence towards intermediate levels is sufficiently rapid for it to have happened in the early stages of the HIV epidemic, and confirms that existing viral loads are nearly optimal given the assumed constraints on evolution. The model provides a useful framework under which to examine the future evolution of HIV-1 virulence.
","Recent studies have suggested that virulence in HIV-1 is partly a characteristic of the virus which is carried from one infection to the next. An infection with intermediate virulence will produce more transmissions during the infectious lifetime because it optimises the trade-off between rate of transmission and duration of infection. Natural selection acts on the heritable variation to increase the relative prevalence of strains with intermediate virulence. In this study we model the evolution of virulence in the viral population as these more successful strains are preferentially transmitted. We fit this model to data from transmitting couples, and find that the model fits the data well. We use this fit to estimate the contribution of the host and the virus to virulence, which complements recent estimates of the heritability of virulence. We also estimate the rate at which the viral determinants of virulence evolve between infections, and this provides predictions for how rapidly the virulence of HIV-1 evolves in a population. We suggest that natural selection on transmissibility results in substantial evolution of virulence in the population. This is sufficiently rapid for virulence to have reached current levels over the available timescale of the human epidemic.

"Endocycle is a commonly observed cell cycle variant through which cells undergo repeated rounds of genome DNA replication without mitosis. Endocycling cells arise from mitotic cells through a switch of the cell cycle mode, called the mitotic-to-endocycle switch (MES), to initiate cell growth and terminal differentiation. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of MES remain unclear. Here we used the Drosophila steroidogenic organ, called the prothoracic gland (PG), to study regulatory mechanisms of MES, which is critical for the PG to upregulate biosynthesis of the steroid hormone ecdysone. We demonstrate that PG cells undergo MES through downregulation of mitotic cyclins, which is mediated by Fizzy-related (Fzr). Moreover, we performed a RNAi screen to further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of MES, and identified the evolutionarily conserved chaperonin TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) as a novel regulator of MES. Knockdown of TRiC subunits in the PG caused a prolonged mitotic period, probably due to impaired nuclear translocation of Fzr, which also caused loss of ecdysteroidogenic activity. These results indicate that TRiC supports proper MES and endocycle progression by regulating Fzr folding. We propose that TRiC-mediated protein quality control is a conserved mechanism supporting MES and endocycling, as well as subsequent terminal differentiation.
","Endocycle, a cell cycle variant consisting of DNA replication and Gap phases without a mitotic phase, is widespread in nature. Endocycling cells arise from proliferating cells through a switch of the cell cycle mode called mitotic-to-endocycle switching (MES). While the molecular mechanisms regulating progression of the mitotic cell cycle and endocycle have been well studied, the regulatory mechanism of MES and its impact on cell differentiation processes remains poorly understood. Here we used the Drosophila steroidogenic organ to uncover the regulatory factors of MES, and our genetic analyses identified the evolutionarily conserved chaperonin TRiC as a novel regulator of MES and subsequent steroidogenesis. Given that TRiC supports proper folding of numerous proteins including cell cycle regulators, TRiC-mediated protein quality control will be a fundamental mechanism supporting a switch of the cell cycle mode that promotes terminal differentiation.

"Cryptosporidium is a major pathogen associated with diarrheal disease in young children. We studied Cryptosporidium diarrhea in children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) in rural Gambia.
We recruited children <5 years of age with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) for 3 years (2008–2010), and children with either MSD or less severe diarrhea (LSD) for one year (November 2011-November 2012) at sentinel health centers. One or more randomly selected controls were matched to each case. Stool samples were tested to identify Cryptosporidium by immunoassay. A subset of randomly selected case-controls pairs were tested for Cryptosporidium species. We investigated the epidemiology of, and evaluated possible risk factors for, Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea.
We enrolled 1938 cases (1381 MSD, 557 LSD) and 2969 matched controls; 231/1929 (12.0%) of diarrhea cases and 141/2962 (4.8%) of controls were positive for Cryptosporidium. Most Cryptosporidium diarrhea cases (85.7%, 198/231) were aged 6–23 months, and most (81.4%, 188/231) occurred during the rainy season. Cryptosporidium hominis (C. hominis) was the predominant (82.6%) species. We found associations between increased risk of Cryptosporidium-positive MSD or LSD, or both, with consumption of stored drinking water and certain animals living in the compound—cow, cat (MSD only) and rodents (LSD only). Larger households, fowl living in the compound, and the presence of Giardia infection were associated with decreased risk of Cryptosporidium MSD and LSD.
Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea is prevalent in this setting, especially at 6–23 months of age. The preponderance of Cryptosporidium infection in the rainy season and increased risk of Cryptosporidium-positive diarrhea with consumption of stored drinking water suggest water-borne transmission. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of animals and contamination of stored drinking water in Cryptosporidium transmission.
","Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite, is one of the most common diarrheal pathogens in young children living in developing countries. We describe the prevalence and risk factors for Cryptosporidium diarrhea in under-five children in The Gambia using data from the Global Enteric Study (GEMS), conducted in seven developing countries in Asia and Africa (2008–2012). We enrolled 1938 diarrhea cases and 2969 matched controls. We found that 12.0% of diarrhea cases and 4.8% controls were positive for Cryptosporidium. Most (85.7%) Cryptosporidium diarrhea cases were aged 6–23 months, and most (81.4%) occurred during the rainy season. Cryptosporidium hominis was the predominant species (82.6%). We found that consumption of stored drinking water and animals (cow, cat, rodents) living in the compound are potential risk factors for Cryptosporidium diarrhea. Improved drinking water storage may reduce the burden of Cryptosporidium diarrhea in a resource poor hygienic and sanitation setting.

"Estimates of genetic diversity in helminth infections of humans often have to rely on genotyping (immature) parasite transmission stages instead of adult worms. Here we analyse the results of one such study investigating a single polymorphic locus (a change at position 200 of the β-tubulin gene) in microfilariae of the lymphatic filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The presence of this genetic change has been implicated in benzimidazole resistance in parasitic nematodes of farmed ruminants. Microfilariae were obtained from patients of three West African villages, two of which were sampled prior to the introduction of mass drug administration. An individual-based stochastic model was developed showing that a wide range of allele frequencies in the adult worm populations could have generated the observed microfilarial genetic diversity. This suggests that appropriate theoretical null models are required in order to interpret studies that genotype transmission stages. Wright's hierarchical F-statistic was used to investigate the population structure in W. bancrofti microfilariae and showed significant deficiency of heterozygotes compared to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; this may be partially caused by a high degree of parasite genetic differentiation between hosts. Studies seeking to quantify accurately the genetic diversity of helminth populations by analysing transmission stages should increase their sample size to account for the variability in allele frequency between different parasite life-stages. Helminth genetic differentiation between hosts and non-random mating will also increase the number of hosts (and the number of samples per host) that need to be genotyped, and could enhance the rate of spread of anthelmintic resistance.
","During the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the use of mass drug administration to reduce the disease caused by parasitic worms. With so many people regularly receiving treatment, there is a risk that drug resistance may develop. As a result, the number of studies looking for genetic markers of drug resistance has increased noticeably. In this paper we analyse the results of one such study that investigated the presence of genes associated with drug resistance in parasites responsible for elephantiasis. This study, like many other studies of human parasitic infections, relies on analysing parasite immature stages (such as eggs) because the adult worms are often inaccessible within the human body. Using computer models we show how the gene frequency in the immature stages may vary from that in the adult worm population. Parasites with these markers for drug resistance might also be unevenly distributed across the host population even prior to treatment. This may increase the spread of drug resistance and make it harder to detect. We suggest that studies conducted only on parasite immature stages should be interpreted with caution and should carefully consider the number of people and the number of parasites they analyse.

"Separase is best known for its function in sister chromatid separation at the metaphase-anaphase transition. It also has a role in centriole disengagement in late mitosis/G1. To gain insight into the activity of separase at centrosomes, we developed two separase activity sensors: mCherry-Scc1(142-467)-ΔNLS-eGFP-PACT and mCherry-kendrin(2059-2398)-eGFP-PACT. Both localize to the centrosomes and enabled us to monitor local separase activity at the centrosome in real time. Both centrosomal sensors were cleaved by separase before anaphase onset, earlier than the corresponding H2B-mCherry-Scc1(142-467)-eGFP sensor at chromosomes. This indicates that substrate cleavage by separase is not synchronous in the cells. Depletion of the proteins astrin or Aki1, which have been described as inhibitors of centrosomal separase, did not led to a significant activation of separase at centrosomes, emphasizing the importance of direct separase activity measurements at the centrosomes. Inhibition of polo-like kinase Plk1, on the other hand, decreased the separase activity towards the Scc1 but not the kendrin reporter. Together these findings indicate that Plk1 regulates separase activity at the level of substrate affinity at centrosomes and may explain in part the role of Plk1 in centriole disengagement.
","Centriole disengagement in telophase/G1 is the licensing step for centrosome duplication in the subsequent S phase. Recent data suggest that separase, together with polo-like kinase Plk1, is essential for the centriole disengagement and individual depletion of either separase or Plk1 alone fails to suppress the centriole disengagement. This raises the question of how separase activity is regulated at the centrosome. By generating a series of separase sensors, we show that separase at centrosomes becomes active already in mid metaphase, well before its activity can be detected at the chromosomes. Depletion of the previously published inhibitors of centrosomal separase, astrin or Aki1, did not promote separase activity at the centrosomes. This indicates that morphological criteria like the formation of multipolar spindles are insufficient criteria upon which to base predictions about separase regulation. Finally, the ability of Plk1 to promote cleavage of the Scc1-based reporter but not of the kendrin reporter reveals regulation of separase activity at the substrate level. These results provide partial explanation of the role of Plk1 in centriole disengagement.

"Members of the Ski/Sno protein family are classified as proto-oncogenes and act as negative regulators of the TGF-ß/BMP-pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates. A newly identified member of this protein family is fussel (fuss), the Drosophila homologue of the human functional Smad suppressing elements (fussel-15 and fussel-18). We and others have shown that Fuss interacts with SMAD4 and that overexpression leads to a strong inhibition of Dpp signaling. However, to be able to characterize the endogenous Fuss function in Drosophila melanogaster, we have generated a number of state of the art tools including anti-Fuss antibodies, specific fuss-Gal4 lines and fuss mutant fly lines via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Fuss is a predominantly nuclear, postmitotic protein, mainly expressed in interneurons and fuss mutants are fully viable without any obvious developmental phenotype. To identify potential target genes or cells affected in fuss mutants, we conducted targeted DamID experiments in adult flies, which revealed the function of fuss in bitter gustatory neurons. We fully characterized fuss expression in the adult proboscis and by using food choice assays we were able to show that fuss mutants display defects in detecting bitter compounds. This correlated with a reduction of gustatory receptor gene expression (Gr33a, Gr66a, Gr93a) providing a molecular link to the behavioral phenotype. In addition, Fuss interacts with Rpd3, and downregulation of rpd3 in gustatory neurons phenocopies the loss of Fuss expression. Surprisingly, there is no colocalization of Fuss with phosphorylated Mad in the larval central nervous system, excluding a direct involvement of Fuss in Dpp/BMP signaling. Here we provide a first and exciting link of Fuss function in gustatory bitter neurons. Although gustatory receptors have been well characterized, little is known regarding the differentiation and maturation of gustatory neurons. This work therefore reveals Fuss as a pivotal element for the proper differentiation of bitter gustatory neurons acting within a chromatin modifying complex.
","Ski/Sno proteins have been discovered as proto-oncogenes transforming chicken fibroblasts into cancer cells. They have been found to be ubiquitously expressed in embryonic and adult tissues and to interfere with TGF-ß/BMP signaling. More recently, a group of proteins has been discovered which belongs to the same protein family, the functional Smad suppressing elements (Fussel). They have a highly restricted, mainly neuronal expression pattern suggesting different functional importance compared to Ski/Sno. We have used Drosophila as a model organism to characterize the highly specific neuronal expression pattern and created knock-out mutations within the Drosophila fuss gene. Surprisingly, fuss mutants are fully viable, but they show defects in bitter taste perception, and indeed, we could prove that Fuss is expressed specifically in bitter sensing neurons, where it affects their terminal differentiation making these cells insensitive for bitter compounds. To understand the molecular process involved in Fuss function we started protein interaction studies and could show, that Fuss forms part of a chromatin modifying complex, which seems to be important for the proper differentiation of neurons in the adult nervous system, therefore, assigning Drosophila as an indispensable model to study the molecular function of the Fuss protein family.

"The Pneumococcal serine-rich repeat protein (PsrP) is a pathogenicity island encoded adhesin that has been positively correlated with the ability of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cause invasive disease. Previous studies have shown that PsrP mediates bacterial attachment to Keratin 10 (K10) on the surface of lung cells through amino acids 273–341 located in the Basic Region (BR) domain. In this study we determined that the BR domain of PsrP also mediates an intra-species interaction that promotes the formation of large bacterial aggregates in the nasopharynx and lungs of infected mice as well as in continuous flow-through models of mature biofilms. Using numerous methods, including complementation of mutants with BR domain deficient constructs, fluorescent microscopy with Cy3-labeled recombinant (r)BR, Far Western blotting of bacterial lysates, co-immunoprecipitation with rBR, and growth of biofilms in the presence of antibodies and competitive peptides, we determined that the BR domain, in particular amino acids 122–166 of PsrP, promoted bacterial aggregation and that antibodies against the BR domain were neutralizing. Using similar methodologies, we also determined that SraP and GspB, the Serine-rich repeat proteins (SRRPs) of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus gordonii, respectively, also promoted bacterial aggregation and that their Non-repeat domains bound to their respective SRRPs. This is the first report to show the presence of biofilm-like structures in the lungs of animals infected with S. pneumoniae and show that SRRPs have dual roles as host and bacterial adhesins. These studies suggest that recombinant Non-repeat domains of SRRPs (i.e. BR for S. pneumoniae) may be useful as vaccine antigens to protect against Gram-positive bacteria that cause infection.
","Serine-rich repeat proteins (SRRPs) are a family of surface-expressed proteins found in numerous Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group B streptococci, and the oral streptococci that cause infective endocarditis. For all of these bacteria, SRRPs have been demonstrated to play pivotal roles in adhesion to tissues and the development of invasive disease. It is now known that biofilm formation is an important step for bacterial pathogenesis. Bacteria in biofilms have been shown to have differences in metabolism, gene expression, and protein production that contribute to enhanced surface adhesion and the persistence of an infection. Herein we describe a novel role for PsrP, the S. pneumoniae SRRP, as an intra-species bacterial adhesin that promotes bacterial aggregation in the lungs of infected mice during pneumonia. In vitro we show that the Basic Region domain of PsrP promotes self-interactions that result in denser biofilms, greater biofilm biomass, and altered architectures of surface grown cultures; these interactions could be neutralized by antibodies to PsrP that are protective against pneumococcal infection. We also demonstrate that the SRRPs of S. aureus and Streptococcus gordonii also function as intra-species bacterial adhesins. Therefore we conclude that SRRPs have dual roles as host-cell and intra-species bacterial adhesins.

"Although sleep is a fundamental behavior observed in virtually all animal species, its functions remain unclear. One leading proposal, known as the synaptic renormalization hypothesis, suggests that sleep is necessary to counteract a global strengthening of synapses that occurs during wakefulness. Evidence for sleep-dependent synaptic downscaling (or synaptic renormalization) has been observed experimentally, but the physiological mechanisms which generate this phenomenon are unknown. In this study, we propose that changes in neuronal membrane excitability induced by acetylcholine may provide a dynamical mechanism for both wake-dependent synaptic upscaling and sleep-dependent downscaling. We show in silico that cholinergically-induced changes in network firing patterns alter overall network synaptic potentiation when synaptic strengths evolve through spike-timing dependent plasticity mechanisms. Specifically, network synaptic potentiation increases dramatically with high cholinergic concentration and decreases dramatically with low levels of acetylcholine. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is robust across variation of many different network parameters.
","The function of sleep is one of the greatest mysteries in contemporary neuroscience. Nearly every species of animal requires it, yet we do not know why. One idea, known as the synaptic renormalization hypothesis, suggests that waking results in a global increase in the strengths of connections in the brain, a phenomenon which is unsustainable because stronger connections consume more energy and take up more space. The function of sleep, according to this hypothesis, is to downscale or “renormalize” connection strengths. While mounting experimental evidence confirms that sleep-dependent synaptic downscaling does occur, we still do not know what biophysical mechanism causes it. In this paper, we show computational results which indicate that the neuromodulator acetylcholine may have a key role to play in sleep-dependent synaptic downscaling. If confirmed experimentally, these findings will help to unravel the mystery of sleep.

"Drug resistance is a rapidly emerging concern, thus prompting the development of novel therapeutics or combinatorial therapy. Currently, combinatorial therapy targets are based on knowledge of drug mode of action and/or resistance mechanisms, constraining the number of target proteins. Unbiased genome-wide screens could reveal novel genetic components within interaction networks as potential targets in combination therapies. Testing this, in the context of antimicrobial resistance, we implemented an unbiased genome-wide screen, performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a Candida glabrata PDR1+ gain-of-function allele. Gain-of-function mutations in this gene are the principal mediators of fluconazole resistance in this human fungal pathogen. Eighteen synthetically lethal S. cerevisiae genetic mutants were identified in cells expressing C. glabrata PDR1+. One mutant, lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, was investigated further. Deletion or drug-mediated inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles. Moreover, deletion or drug-mediated inactivation of Gcn5, inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments. Thus, taken together, the data generated in this study provides proof of concept that synthetically lethal genetic screens can identify novel candidate proteins that when therapeutically targeted could allow effective treatment of drug-resistant infections.
","Life threatening infections are an increasing reality. Multi-drug resistant bacteria e.g. MRSA are present in nearly all hospitals, and community acquired TB is often recalcitrant to treatment. Less well known, but causing four to five times more deaths in the UK than MRSA, are fungi in the genus Candida. These are commonly associated with mucosal infections such as “thrush”, but are responsible for > 400,000 life-threatening infections worldwide every year, especially in the immunosuppressed patient population. One of the principle pathogens is Candida glabrata. This fungus grows as a single celled yeast, and alarmingly is highly resistant to both host innate defences and many clinically used antifungal drugs. Even with the best possible medical care, infections with this yeast cause ~50% mortality and alarmingly the incidence of C. glabrata infections is steadily climbing. This demands that novel antifungal therapies are developed that can target drug resistant fungal infections such as C. glabrata. We have identified genes that prevent the growth of fungal cells that express gain-of-function mutations in Pdr1, a key mediator of antifungal resistance in C. glabrata. We also provide proof of concept that targeting a protein essential for Pdr1 function significantly inhibits the emergence of antifungal drug resistance. Thus such an approach could provide a powerful tool in developing treatments for drug resistant infections.

"High blood pressure (BP) is the most common cardiovascular risk factor worldwide and a major contributor to heart disease and stroke. We previously discovered a BP-associated missense SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)–rs2272996–in the gene encoding vanin-1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane pantetheinase. In the present study, we first replicated the association of rs2272996 and BP traits with a total sample size of nearly 30,000 individuals from the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT) of African Americans (P = 0.01). This association was further validated using patient plasma samples; we observed that the N131S mutation is associated with significantly lower plasma vanin-1 protein levels. We observed that the N131S vanin-1 is subjected to rapid endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) as the underlying mechanism for its reduction. Using HEK293 cells stably expressing vanin-1 variants, we showed that N131S vanin-1 was degraded significantly faster than wild type (WT) vanin-1. Consequently, there were only minimal quantities of variant vanin-1 present on the plasma membrane and greatly reduced pantetheinase activity. Application of MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, resulted in accumulation of ubiquitinated variant protein. A further experiment demonstrated that atenolol and diltiazem, two current drugs for treating hypertension, reduce the vanin-1 protein level. Our study provides strong biological evidence for the association of the identified SNP with BP and suggests that vanin-1 misfolding and degradation are the underlying molecular mechanism.
","Hypertension (HTN) or high blood pressure (BP) is common worldwide and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Identification of genetic variants of consequence for HTN serves as the molecular basis for its treatment. Using admixture mapping analysis of the Family Blood Pressure Program data, we recently identified that the VNN1 gene (encoding the protein vanin-1), in particular SNP rs2272996 (N131S), was associated with BP in both African Americans and Mexican Americans. Vanin-1 was reported to act as an oxidative stress sensor using its pantetheinase enzyme activity. Because a linkage between oxidative stress and HTN has been hypothesized for many years, vanin-1's pantetheinase activity offers a physiologic rationale for BP regulation. Here, we first replicated the association of rs2272996 with BP in the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT), which included nearly 30,000 African Americans. We further demonstrated that the N131S mutation in vanin-1 leads to its rapid degradation in cells, resulting in loss of function on the plasma membrane. The loss of function of vanin-1 is associated with reduced BP. Therefore, our results indicate that vanin-1 is a new candidate to be manipulated to ameliorate HTN.

"Macrophage cells that are stimulated by two different ligands that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) usually respond as if the stimulus effects are additive, but for a minority of ligand combinations the response is synergistic. The G-protein-coupled receptor system integrates signaling cues from the environment to actuate cell morphology, gene expression, ion homeostasis, and other physiological states. We analyze the effects of the two signaling molecules complement factors 5a (C5a) and uridine diphosphate (UDP) on the intracellular second messenger calcium to elucidate the principles that govern the processing of multiple signals by GPCRs. We have developed a formal hypothesis, in the form of a kinetic model, for the mechanism of action of this GPCR signal transduction system using data obtained from RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Bayesian statistical methods are employed to represent uncertainty in both data and model parameters and formally tie the model to experimental data. When the model is also used as a tool in the design of experiments, it predicts a synergistic region in the calcium peak height dose response that results when cells are simultaneously stimulated by C5a and UDP. An analysis of the model reveals a potential mechanism for crosstalk between the Gαi-coupled C5a receptor and the Gαq-coupled UDP receptor signaling systems that results in synergistic calcium release.
","The G protein signal transduction system transmits a wide variety of extracellular signals including light, odors, and hormones, to intracellular effectors in diverse cell types in eukaryotes. G-protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases including inflammation, cardiac dysfunction, and diabetes, and are the targets of 40–50% of modern drugs. Despite the physiological and pharmacological importance of this signal transduction system it is not known how the system buffers and integrates information at a biochemical level. The multiple receptors expressed by every cell pass their signals through a common set of downstream effectors distinguished by multiple isoforms with slightly different specificities and activities. The coupling among these pathways causes interactions among the signals sent by the different classes of receptors. We have developed a mechanistic model of the G protein signal transduction system from the receptor to the central intracellular second-messenger calcium. We have used statistical methods to integrate a diverse set of experimental data into our model and quantify confidence in our model predictions. We used this model, trained on single receptor data, to predict the signal processing of two G-protein-coupled-receptor signals. Validation experiments support our hypothesized mechanism for dual receptor signal processing and the predictions of the model.

"A new approach for the segregation of monaural sound mixtures is presented based on the principle of temporal coherence and using auditory cortical representations. Temporal coherence is the notion that perceived sources emit coherently modulated features that evoke highly-coincident neural response patterns. By clustering the feature channels with coincident responses and reconstructing their input, one may segregate the underlying source from the simultaneously interfering signals that are uncorrelated with it. The proposed algorithm requires no prior information or training on the sources. It can, however, gracefully incorporate cognitive functions and influences such as memories of a target source or attention to a specific set of its attributes so as to segregate it from its background. Aside from its unusual structure and computational innovations, the proposed model provides testable hypotheses of the physiological mechanisms of this ubiquitous and remarkable perceptual ability, and of its psychophysical manifestations in navigating complex sensory environments.
","Humans and many animals can effortlessly navigate complex sensory environments, segregating and attending to one desired target source while suppressing distracting and interfering others. In this paper, we present an algorithmic model that can accomplish this task with no prior information or training on complex signals such as speech mixtures, and speech in noise and music. The model accounts for this ability relying solely on the temporal coherence principle, the notion that perceived sources emit coherently modulated features that evoke coincident cortical response patterns. It further demonstrates how basic cortical mechanisms common to all sensory systems can implement the necessary representations, as well as the adaptive computations necessary to maintain continuity by tracking slowly changing characteristics of different sources in a scene.

"In plants, RNA silencing plays a key role in antiviral defense. To counteract host defense, plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that target different effector molecules in the RNA silencing pathway. Evidence has shown that plants also encode endogenous suppressors of RNA silencing (ESRs) that function in proper regulation of RNA silencing. The possibility that these cellular proteins can be subverted by viruses to thwart host defense is intriguing but has not been fully explored. Here we report that the Nicotiana benthamiana calmodulin-like protein Nbrgs-CaM is required for the functions of the VSR βC1, the sole protein encoded by the DNA satellite associated with the geminivirus Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV). Nbrgs-CaM expression is up-regulated by the βC1. Transgenic plants over-expressing Nbrgs-CaM displayed developmental abnormities reminiscent of βC1-associated morphological alterations. Nbrgs-CaM suppressed RNA silencing in an Agrobacterium infiltration assay and, when over-expressed, blocked TYLCCNV-induced gene silencing. Genetic evidence showed that Nbrgs-CaM mediated the βC1 functions in silencing suppression and symptom modulation, and was required for efficient virus infection. Moreover, the tobacco and tomato orthologs of Nbrgs-CaM also possessed ESR activity, and were induced by betasatellite to promote virus infection in these Solanaceae hosts. We further demonstrated that βC1-induced Nbrgs-CaM suppressed the production of secondary siRNAs, likely through repressing RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) expression. RDR6-deficient N. benthamiana plants were defective in antiviral response and were hypersensitive to TYLCCNV infection. More significantly, TYLCCNV could overcome host range restrictions to infect Arabidopsis thaliana when the plants carried a RDR6 mutation. These findings demonstrate a distinct mechanism of VSR for suppressing PTGS through usurpation of a host ESR, and highlight an essential role for RDR6 in RNA silencing defense response against geminivirus infection.
","In plants, RNA silencing plays a key role in developmental regulation and antiviral defense. To successfully infect their hosts, plant viruses encode silencing suppressors (VSRs) as counter-defense measures. These VSRs function to disable host antiviral RNA silencing defenses through various mechanisms that are not well understood. Here we report that a host calmodulin-like protein called Nbrgs-CaM, which appears to be an endogenous suppressor of RNA silencing, plays essential roles in suppression of RNA silencing and induction of symptoms by the VSR βC1, the sole protein encoded by a geminivirus-associated DNA satellite. The Nbrgs-CaM was up-regulated by Tomato yellow leaf curl China geminivirus (TYLCCNV)-encoded VSR βC1 upon virus infection or stable expression via a transgene. Further analyses revealed that up-regulation of Nbrgs-CaM by βC1 suppressed RNA silencing likely through repressing the expression of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6). We have demonstrated that RDR6-mediated RNA silencing plays an important role in antiviral defense in Nicotiana benthamiana and confers host range restriction against TYLCCNV infection on Arabidopsis thaliana. Our study suggests that exploiting a cellular suppressor can be an efficient mechanism for viruses to counteract host RNA silencing defense response.

"Cys-loop receptors (CLR) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast excitatory or inhibitory transmission in the nervous system. Strychnine and d-tubocurarine (d-TC) are neurotoxins that have been highly instrumental in decades of research on glycine receptors (GlyR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), respectively. In this study we addressed the question how the molecular recognition of strychnine and d-TC occurs with high affinity and yet low specificity towards diverse CLR family members. X-ray crystal structures of the complexes with AChBP, a well-described structural homolog of the extracellular domain of the nAChRs, revealed that strychnine and d-TC adopt multiple occupancies and different ligand orientations, stabilizing the homopentameric protein in an asymmetric state. This introduces a new level of structural diversity in CLRs. Unlike protein and peptide neurotoxins, strychnine and d-TC form a limited number of contacts in the binding pocket of AChBP, offering an explanation for their low selectivity. Based on the ligand interactions observed in strychnine- and d-TC-AChBP complexes we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis in the binding pocket of the human α1 GlyR and α7 nAChR and showed the functional relevance of these residues in conferring high potency of strychnine and d-TC, respectively. Our results demonstrate that a limited number of ligand interactions in the binding pocket together with an energetic stabilization of the extracellular domain are key to the poor selective recognition of strychnine and d-TC by CLRs as diverse as the GlyR, nAChR, and 5-HT3R.
","Ligand-gated ion channels play an important role in fast electrochemical signaling in the brain. Cys-loop receptors are a class of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are activated by specific neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT), glycine (Gly), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Each type of cys-loop receptor contains an extracellular domain that specifically recognizes only one of these four neurotransmitters and opens an ion-conducting channel pore upon ligand binding. In this study, we investigated the poor specificity with which two potent neurotoxic inhibitors, namely strychnine and d-tubocurarine, are recognized by different cys-loop receptors. Using X-ray crystallography we solved 3-dimensional structures of strychnine or d-tubocurarine in complex with ACh binding protein (AChBP), a well-recognized structural homolog of the nicotinic ACh receptor. Based on ligand-receptor interactions observed in AChBP structures we designed mutant GlyR and α7 nAChR to identify hot spots in the binding pocket of these receptors that define potent inhibition by strychnine and d-tubocurarine, respectively. Combined, our results offer detailed understanding of the molecular recognition of antagonists that have high affinity but poor specificity for different cys-loop receptors.

"In recent decades, there has been a shift to later childbearing in high-income countries. There is limited large-scale evidence of the relationship between maternal age and child outcomes beyond the perinatal period. The objective of this study is to quantify a child’s risk of developmental vulnerability at age five, according to their mother’s age at childbirth.
Linkage of population-level perinatal, hospital, and birth registration datasets to data from the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) and school enrolments in Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), enabled us to follow a cohort of 99,530 children from birth to their first year of school in 2009 or 2012. The study outcome was teacher-reported child development on five domains measured by the AEDC, including physical health and well-being, emotional maturity, social competence, language and cognitive skills, and communication skills and general knowledge. Developmental vulnerability was defined as domain scores below the 2009 AEDC 10th percentile cut point.
The mean maternal age at childbirth was 29.6 years (standard deviation [SD], 5.7), with 4,382 children (4.4%) born to mothers aged <20 years and 20,026 children (20.1%) born to mothers aged ≥35 years. The proportion vulnerable on ≥1 domains was 21% overall and followed a reverse J-shaped distribution according to maternal age: it was highest in children born to mothers aged ≤15 years, at 40% (95% CI, 32–49), and was lowest in children born to mothers aged between 30 years and ≤35 years, at 17%–18%. For maternal ages 36 years to ≥45 years, the proportion vulnerable on ≥1 domains increased to 17%–24%. Adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics significantly attenuated vulnerability risk in children born to younger mothers, while adjustment for potentially modifiable factors, such as antenatal visits, had little additional impact across all ages. Although the multi-agency linkage yielded a broad range of sociodemographic, perinatal, health, and developmental variables at the child’s birth and school entry, the study was necessarily limited to variables available in the source data, which were mostly recorded for administrative purposes.
Increasing maternal age was associated with a lesser risk of developmental vulnerability for children born to mothers aged 15 years to about 30 years. In contrast, increasing maternal age beyond 35 years was generally associated with increasing vulnerability, broadly equivalent to the risk for children born to mothers in their early twenties, which is highly relevant in the international context of later childbearing. That socioeconomic disadvantage explained approximately half of the increased risk of developmental vulnerability associated with younger motherhood suggests there may be scope to improve population-level child development through policies and programs that support disadvantaged mothers and children.
","There has been a shift towards later childbearing in recent decades; although the perinatal risks are well documented, the consequences on child development are less clear.
Several observational cohort studies have reported that increasing maternal age is associated with better child development outcomes, although the numbers of children born to older mothers were limited and broad maternal age categories have often been used.
Recent evidence suggests that the relationship between older maternal age at childbirth and child cognitive ability may have shifted over time; this is largely explained by shifts in the sociodemographic and perinatal characteristics related to maternal age at childbirth.
We used linked, population-level data to study the association between maternal age at childbirth and developmental vulnerability at age five in 99,530 children who started school in New South Wales, Australia, in 2009 or 2012.
Children born to the youngest mothers had the highest risk of developmental vulnerability on all domains at age five, and the risk declined with increasing maternal age through to 30 years.
Older motherhood was associated with a small increased risk of developmental vulnerability at age five, particularly in the physical health and well-being, social competence, and emotional maturity domains, equivalent to the risk for children born to mothers in their early twenties.
Socioeconomic disadvantage largely accounted for the increased risk of developmental vulnerability associated with younger motherhood.
To our knowledge, this study is the largest-scale evidence internationally on the relationship between maternal age at childbirth—across the whole distribution of maternal ages—and early childhood development.
There may be scope to improve child development at a population level via policies and programs that support disadvantaged mothers and children.
The small increased risk of developmental vulnerability in children born to older mothers is highly relevant in the international context of childbearing at increasingly older ages.
Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms that underlie the elevated risk of developmental vulnerability in children born to older mothers, as well as the early childhood factors that potentially offset the increased pregnancy/birth risks associated with older motherhood.

"We describe the rudolph mouse, a mutant with striking defects in both central nervous system and skeletal development. Rudolph is an allele of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 7, which is an intriguing finding given the recent implication of oxysterols in mediating intracellular Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. We see an abnormal sterol profile and decreased Hh target gene induction in the rudolph mutant, both in vivo and in vitro. Reduced Hh signaling has been proposed to contribute to the phenotypes of congenital diseases of cholesterol metabolism. Recent in vitro and pharmacological data also indicate a requirement for intracellular cholesterol synthesis for proper regulation of Hh activity via Smoothened. The data presented here are the first in vivo genetic evidence supporting both of these hypotheses, revealing a role for embryonic cholesterol metabolism in both CNS development and normal Hh signaling.
","The molecules and signaling pathways that regulate growth and patterning of the developing embryo are still being elucidated, and one valuable experimental approach is the use of animal models, such as the mouse. We have identified a recessive mutation in the mouse, rudolph, that causes abnormal forebrain development and have determined that the mutated gene encodes hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 7 gene, an enzyme necessary for cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol is essential for proper signal transduction of the hedgehog family of proteins, key regulators of both developmental biology and tumor progression. We show that hedgehog signaling is diminished in our rudolph mutant. Our conclusions from studying this mouse mutant support two recent hypotheses in developmental biology. First, several human malformation syndromes are known to be caused by defects in cholesterol metabolism, but support linking the malformation to abnormal hedgehog signaling has not definitively been made. Second, while in vitro studies have shown that proper levels of metabolic by-products of cholesterol are necessary for proper hedgehog signaling, our studies offer the strongest genetic animal model evidence to support this idea.

"Dengue is the commonest arboviral disease of humans. An early and accurate diagnosis of dengue can support clinical management, surveillance and disease control and is central to achieving the World Health Organisation target of a 50% reduction in dengue case mortality by 2020.
5729 children with fever of <72hrs duration were enrolled into this multicenter prospective study in southern Vietnam between 2010-2012. A composite of gold standard diagnostic tests identified 1692 dengue cases. Using statistical methods, a novel Early Dengue Classifier (EDC) was developed that used patient age, white blood cell count and platelet count to discriminate dengue cases from non-dengue cases.
The EDC had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0-76.8%) and specificity of 76.3% (95%CI: 75.2-77.6%) for the diagnosis of dengue. As an adjunctive test alongside NS1 rapid testing, sensitivity of the composite test was 91.6% (95%CI: 90.4-92.9%).
We demonstrate that the early diagnosis of dengue can be enhanced beyond the current standard of care using a simple evidence-based algorithm. The results should support patient management and clinical trials of specific therapies.
","Dengue is a very common acute infectious disease in the tropical world. Health care professionals are able to better care for dengue patients if they can make an early diagnosis and make a plan for case management. This current study investigated fever in 5729 children in Vietnam with 3 days or less of fever and identified 1692 dengue cases using advanced, gold standard methods. We systematically collected a range of medical and laboratory findings on each patient when they entered the study and used statistical tools to determine if these medical and laboratory findings could enable early diagnosis, independent of sophisticated, gold-standard laboratory tests. Our results, called the Early Dengue Classifier, had performance characteristics suggesting it could improve the diagnostic proficiency of health care professionals. However the performance of the Early Dengue Classifier is not perfect and likely will not change the practice of experienced doctors in dengue endemic settings. Our study highlights the need for 2nd generation, easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests that can accurately diagnose dengue in the first few days of fever.

"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is considered the etiological agent of Merkel cell carcinoma and persists asymptomatically in the majority of its healthy hosts. Largely due to the lack of appropriate model systems, the mechanisms of viral replication and MCPyV persistence remain poorly understood. Using a semi-permissive replication system, we here report a comprehensive analysis of the role of the MCPyV-encoded microRNA (miRNA) mcv-miR-M1 during short and long-term replication of authentic MCPyV episomes. We demonstrate that cells harboring intact episomes express high levels of the viral miRNA, and that expression of mcv-miR-M1 limits DNA replication. Furthermore, we present RACE, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies which allow insight in the viral transcription program and mechanisms of miRNA expression. While our data suggest that mcv-miR-M1 can be expressed from canonical late strand transcripts, we also present evidence for the existence of an independent miRNA promoter that is embedded within early strand coding sequences. We also report that MCPyV genomes can establish episomal persistence in a small number of cells for several months, a time period during which viral DNA as well as LT-Ag and viral miRNA expression can be detected via western blotting, FISH, qPCR and southern blot analyses. Strikingly, despite enhanced replication in short term DNA replication assays, a mutant unable to express the viral miRNA was severely limited in its ability to establish long-term persistence. Our data suggest that MCPyV may have evolved strategies to enter a non- or low level vegetative stage of infection which could aid the virus in establishing and maintaining a lifelong persistence.
","MCPyV is a recently discovered human polyomavirus that is likely to cause the majority of cases of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare but highly aggressive skin cancer. While much research has been focused on understanding transforming functions of MCPyV gene products, owing to the lack of fully permissive replication systems, the natural lifecycle of the virus is poorly understood. Using high-throughput analyses, here we have interrogated a semi-permissive replication system to study the viral transcription program and elucidate the functions of the viral microRNA (miRNA) mcv-miR-M1. We find that, similar to other polyomavirus miRNAs, mcv-miR-M1 has the ability to negatively regulate expression of viral gene products required for viral DNA replication. Unexpectedly, however, we also observe that mcv-miR-M1 augments long-term episomal persistence of MCPyV genomes. Given that MCPyV establishes persistent infections in the majority of healthy human adults, our observations shed new light on the mechanisms that may be employed by this tumor virus to mount a lifelong chronic infection of its host.

"Chloride homeostasis is a critical determinant of the strength and robustness of inhibition mediated by GABAA receptors (GABAARs). The impact of changes in steady state Cl− gradient is relatively straightforward to understand, but how dynamic interplay between Cl− influx, diffusion, extrusion and interaction with other ion species affects synaptic signaling remains uncertain. Here we used electrodiffusion modeling to investigate the nonlinear interactions between these processes. Results demonstrate that diffusion is crucial for redistributing intracellular Cl− load on a fast time scale, whereas Cl−extrusion controls steady state levels. Interaction between diffusion and extrusion can result in a somato-dendritic Cl− gradient even when KCC2 is distributed uniformly across the cell. Reducing KCC2 activity led to decreased efficacy of GABAAR-mediated inhibition, but increasing GABAAR input failed to fully compensate for this form of disinhibition because of activity-dependent accumulation of Cl−. Furthermore, if spiking persisted despite the presence of GABAAR input, Cl− accumulation became accelerated because of the large Cl− driving force that occurs during spikes. The resulting positive feedback loop caused catastrophic failure of inhibition. Simulations also revealed other feedback loops, such as competition between Cl− and pH regulation. Several model predictions were tested and confirmed by [Cl−]i imaging experiments. Our study has thus uncovered how Cl− regulation depends on a multiplicity of dynamically interacting mechanisms. Furthermore, the model revealed that enhancing KCC2 activity beyond normal levels did not negatively impact firing frequency or cause overt extracellular K− accumulation, demonstrating that enhancing KCC2 activity is a valid strategy for therapeutic intervention.
","Fast synaptic inhibition relies on chloride current to hyperpolarize the neuron or to prevent depolarization caused by concurrent excitatory input. Both scenarios necessarily involve chloride flux into the cell and, thus, a change in intracellular chloride concentration. The vast majority of models neglect changes in ion concentration despite experimental evidence that such changes occur and are not inconsequential. The importance of considering chloride homeostasis mechanisms is heightened by evidence that several neurological diseases are associated with deficient chloride extrusion capacity. Steady state chloride levels are altered in those disease states. Fast chloride dynamics are also likely affected, but those changes have yet to be explored. To this end, we built an electrodiffusion model that tracks changes in the concentration of chloride plus multiple other ion species. Simulations in this model revealed a multitude of complex, nonlinear interactions that have important consequences for the efficacy of synaptic inhibition. Several predictions from the model were tested and confirmed with chloride imaging experiments.

"Computational approaches have promised to organize collections of functional genomics data into testable predictions of gene and protein involvement in biological processes and pathways. However, few such predictions have been experimentally validated on a large scale, leaving many bioinformatic methods unproven and underutilized in the biology community. Further, it remains unclear what biological concerns should be taken into account when using computational methods to drive real-world experimental efforts. To investigate these concerns and to establish the utility of computational predictions of gene function, we experimentally tested hundreds of predictions generated from an ensemble of three complementary methods for the process of mitochondrial organization and biogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biological data with respect to the mitochondria are presented in a companion manuscript published in PLoS Genetics (doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000407). Here we analyze and explore the results of this study that are broadly applicable for computationalists applying gene function prediction techniques, including a new experimental comparison with 48 genes representing the genomic background. Our study leads to several conclusions that are important to consider when driving laboratory investigations using computational prediction approaches. While most genes in yeast are already known to participate in at least one biological process, we confirm that genes with known functions can still be strong candidates for annotation of additional gene functions. We find that different analysis techniques and different underlying data can both greatly affect the types of functional predictions produced by computational methods. This diversity allows an ensemble of techniques to substantially broaden the biological scope and breadth of predictions. We also find that performing prediction and validation steps iteratively allows us to more completely characterize a biological area of interest. While this study focused on a specific functional area in yeast, many of these observations may be useful in the contexts of other processes and organisms.
","Genome sequencing has provided us with “parts lists” of genes for many organisms, but many of the biological roles these genes are still unknown. While a great deal of functional genomic data exists, providing information about these genes and their roles, the rate at which these data are leveraged into concrete biological knowledge lags far behind the rate of data generation. Many computational approaches have been developed to generate accurate predictions of gene functions, with the goal of bridging this divide. However, as no large-scale experimental efforts have been based on such approaches, their validity and utility remains unproven. We have performed a study that experimentally evaluates predictions from a combination of three computational function prediction approaches, focusing on mitochondrion-related processes in brewer's yeast as a model system. By using computational predictions to guide our laboratory investigation, we have greatly accelerated the rate at which proteins can be assigned to biological processes. Further, our results demonstrate that in order to achieve the best results, it is important for computational biologists to consider both the underlying data and the algorithmic foundations of the methods used to predict function. Lastly, we demonstrate that iterating through phases of prediction and validation has quickly and extensively expanded our knowledge of mitochondrial biology.

"Various observations argue for a role of adaptation in recent human evolution, including results from genome-wide studies and analyses of selection signals at candidate genes. Here, we use genome-wide SNP data from the HapMap and CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel samples to study the geographic distributions of putatively selected alleles at a range of geographic scales. We find that the average allele frequency divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme FST values across the whole genome. On a broad scale, the geographic distribution of putatively selected alleles almost invariably conforms to population clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often weak enough that neutral processes—especially population history, migration, and drift—exert powerful influences over the fate and geographic distribution of selected alleles.
","Since the beginning of the study of evolution, people have been fascinated by recent human evolution and adaptation. Despite great progress in our understanding of human history, we still know relatively little about the selection pressures and historical factors that have been important over the past 100,000 years. In that time human populations have spread around the world and adapted in a wide variety of ways to the new environments they have encountered. Here, we investigate the genomic signal of these adaptations using a large set of geographically diverse human populations typed at thousands of genetic markers across the genome. We find that patterns at selected loci are predictable from the patterns found at all markers genome-wide. On the basis of this, we argue that selection has been strongly constrained by the historical relationships and gene flow between populations.

"Claudins constitute the major component of tight junctions and regulate paracellular permeability of epithelia. Claudin-10 occurs in two major isoforms that form paracellular channels with ion selectivity. We report on two families segregating an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized anhidrosis, severe heat intolerance and mild kidney failure. All affected individuals carry a rare homozygous missense mutation c.144C>G, p.(N48K) specific for the claudin-10b isoform. Immunostaining of sweat glands from patients suggested that the disease is associated with reduced levels of claudin-10b in the plasma membranes and in canaliculi of the secretory portion. Expression of claudin-10b N48K in a 3D cell model of sweat secretion indicated perturbed paracellular Na+ transport. Analysis of paracellular permeability revealed that claudin-10b N48K maintained cation over anion selectivity but with a reduced general ion conductance. Furthermore, freeze fracture electron microscopy showed that claudin-10b N48K was associated with impaired tight junction strand formation and altered cis-oligomer formation. These data suggest that claudin-10b N48K causes anhidrosis and our findings are consistent with a combined effect from perturbed TJ function and increased degradation of claudin-10b N48K in the sweat glands. Furthermore, affected individuals present with Mg2+ retention, secondary hyperparathyroidism and mild kidney failure that suggest a disturbed reabsorption of cations in the kidneys. These renal-derived features recapitulate several phenotypic aspects detected in mice with kidney specific loss of both claudin-10 isoforms. Our study adds to the spectrum of phenotypes caused by tight junction proteins and demonstrates a pivotal role for claudin-10b in maintaining paracellular Na+ permeability for sweat production and kidney function.
","Claudins are tight junction proteins forming paracellular barriers that are critical for normal development and homeostasis. The tissue specific paracellular barrier properties are determined by the protein composition of tight junctions that regulates the permeability of solutes and water between different compartments of the body. We show, for the first time, that a mutation in claudin-10b, forming paracellular cation channels in different tissues, causes perturbed Na+ selectivity through altered tight junction formation and function as well as increased degradation of the protein. The mutation is associated with the inability to sweat (anhidrosis) and heat intolerance as well as abnormal cation reabsorption, hypermagnesemia and kidney damage. Our combined findings show that the claudin-10b-mediated paracellular Na+ transport is required for normal sweat production and for the regulation of cation homeostasis in the kidneys.

"Understanding the rat neurochemical connectome is fundamental for exploring neuronal information processing. By using advanced data mining, supervised machine learning, and network analysis, this study integrates over 5 decades of neuroanatomical investigations into a multiscale, multilayer neurochemical connectome of the rat brain. This neurochemical connectivity database (ChemNetDB) is supported by comprehensive systematically-determined receptor distribution maps. The rat connectome has an onion-type structural organization and shares a number of structural features with mesoscale connectomes of mouse and macaque. Furthermore, we demonstrate that extremal values of graph theoretical measures (e.g., degree and betweenness) are associated with evolutionary-conserved deep brain structures such as amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal raphe, and lateral hypothalamus, which regulate primitive, yet fundamental functions, such as circadian rhythms, reward, aggression, anxiety, and fear. The ChemNetDB is a freely available resource for systems analysis of motor, sensory, emotional, and cognitive information processing.
","The mammalian brain consists of a network of chemically diverse, multiscale, and multilayer neuronal wiring patterns that form the physical infrastructure underlying the processing of motoric, sensory, emotional, and cognitive information. Decades of histological track-tracing studies have generated a set of highly valuable yet disorganized data, which is very hard to retrieve in a hypothesis-free manner. We present an open-access database (ChemNetDB) that organizes over 50 years of neuroanatomical track-tracing and neurochemical measurements from 36,464 rats. This neurochemical connectome is terminologically consistent and shares several network invariants with mouse and macaque cortical networks, suggesting that the mammalian brain exhibits universal structural features. Furthermore, several network measures reflect and confirm the key functional roles of deep subcortical brain areas, which are known to be responsible for primitive, yet essential and evolutionary conserved functions related to survival. ChemNetDB provides the first whole-brain, multiscale, and consistently collated rat connectome database. ChemNetDB also includes neurochemical specificity and represents a powerful tool for in vitro, in vivo, and in silico investigations of brain function and disorders.

"Members of the LCCL/lectin adhesive-like protein (LAP) family, a family of six putative secreted proteins with predicted adhesive extracellular domains, have all been detected in the sexual and sporogonic stages of Plasmodium and have previously been predicted to play a role in parasite–mosquito interactions and/or immunomodulation. In this study we have investigated the function of PbLAP1, 2, 4, and 6. Through phenotypic analysis of Plasmodium berghei loss-of-function mutants, we have demonstrated that PbLAP2, 4, and 6, as previously shown for PbLAP1, are critical for oocyst maturation and sporozoite formation, and essential for transmission from mosquitoes to mice. Sporozoite formation was rescued by a genetic cross with wild-type parasites, which results in the production of heterokaryotic polyploid ookinetes and oocysts, and ultimately infective Δpblap sporozoites, but not if the individual Δpblap parasite lines were crossed amongst each other. Genetic crosses with female-deficient (Δpbs47) and male-deficient (Δpbs48/45) parasites show that the lethal phenotype is only rescued when the wild-type pblap gene is inherited from a female gametocyte, thus explaining the failure to rescue in the crosses between different Δpblap parasite lines. We conclude that the functions of PbLAPs1, 2, 4, and 6 are critical prior to the expression of the male-derived gene after microgametogenesis, fertilization, and meiosis, possibly in the gametocyte-to-ookinete period of differentiation. The phenotypes detectable by cytological methods in the oocyst some 10 d after the critical period of activity suggests key roles of the LAPs or LAP-dependent processes in the regulation of the cell cycle, possibly in the regulation of cytoplasm-to-nuclear ratio, and, importantly, in the events of cytokinesis at sporozoite formation. This phenotype is not seen in the other dividing forms of the mutant parasite lines in the liver and blood stages.
","Malaria parasites are transmitted between human hosts by female mosquitoes. Following fertilization between male and female gametes in the blood meal, zygotes develop into motile ookinetes that, 24 hours later, cross the mosquito midgut epithelium and encyst on the midgut wall. During this development, parasite numbers fall dramatically and as such, this may be an ideal point at which to disrupt transmission, but first essential parasite targets need to be identified. A protein family implicated in the interactions between parasites and mosquitoes is the LCCL/lectin adhesive-like protein (LAP) family. LAPs are highly expressed in the sexual and ookinete stages, yet when we removed genes encoding each of four LAPs from the genome of a rodent model malaria parasite, a developmental defect was only observed in the oocyst some ten days after the protein was first expressed. These “knockout” parasites did not undergo normal replication and consequently could not be transmitted to mice. Through genetic crosses with parasite mutants producing exclusively either female or male gametes, we demonstrate that parasites can only complete their development successfully if a wild-type lap gene is inherited through the female cell. These data throw new light on the regulation of parasite development in the mosquito, suggesting that initial development is maternally controlled, and that the LAPs may be candidates for intervention.

"Functional-effective connectivity and network topology are nowadays key issues for studying brain physiological functions and pathologies. Inferring neuronal connectivity from electrophysiological recordings presents open challenges and unsolved problems. In this work, we present a cross-correlation based method for reliably estimating not only excitatory but also inhibitory links, by analyzing multi-unit spike activity from large-scale neuronal networks. The method is validated by means of realistic simulations of large-scale neuronal populations. New results related to functional connectivity estimation and network topology identification obtained by experimental electrophysiological recordings from high-density and large-scale (i.e., 4096 electrodes) microtransducer arrays coupled to in vitro neural populations are presented. Specifically, we show that: (i) functional inhibitory connections are accurately identified in in vitro cortical networks, providing that a reasonable firing rate and recording length are achieved; (ii) small-world topology, with scale-free and rich-club features are reliably obtained, on condition that a minimum number of active recording sites are available. The method and procedure can be directly extended and applied to in vivo multi-units brain activity recordings.
","The balance between excitation and inhibition is fundamental for proper brain functions and for this reason is precisely regulated in adult cortices. Impaired excitation/inhibition balance is often associated with several neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, autism and schizophrenia. However, estimating functional inhibitory connections is not an easy task and few methods are available to identify such connections from electrophysiological data. Here we present a cross-correlation based method to identify both excitatory and inhibitory functional connections in large-scale neuronal networks. The method is applicable to both in vitro and in vivo spike data recordings. Once a connectivity map (i.e. a graph) is obtained, we characterized the associated topology by means of classical graph theory metrics to unveil functional architecture. In this work, we analyze in vitro cortical networks probed by means of large-scale microelectrode arrays (i.e., 4096 sensors) and we derive network topologies from spike data. The functional organization found is called “small-world and scale-free” and is the same organization found in cortical in vivo brain regions by means of different experimental methods. We also show that to obtain reliable information about network architecture at least a network with a hundred of nodes-neurons is needed.

"In this study we generated a novel dual specific phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) deletion mouse using a targeted deletion strategy in order to examine the role of MAP kinase phosphatase-2 (MKP-2) in immune responses. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced a rapid, time and concentration-dependent increase in MKP-2 protein expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages from MKP-2+/+ but not from MKP-2−/− mice. LPS-induced JNK and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation was significantly increased and prolonged in MKP-2−/− macrophages whilst ERK phosphorylation was unaffected. MKP-2 deletion also potentiated LPS-stimulated induction of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-12p40, TNF-α, and also COX-2 derived PGE2 production. However surprisingly, in MKP-2−/− macrophages, there was a marked reduction in LPS or IFNγ-induced iNOS and nitric oxide release and enhanced basal expression of arginase-1, suggesting that MKP-2 may have an additional regulatory function significant in pathogen-mediated immunity. Indeed, following infection with the intracellular parasite Leishmania mexicana, MKP-2−/− mice displayed increased lesion size and parasite burden, and a significantly modified Th1/Th2 bias compared with wild-type counterparts. However, there was no intrinsic defect in MKP-2−/− T cell function as measured by anti-CD3 induced IFN-γ production. Rather, MKP-2−/− bone marrow-derived macrophages were found to be inherently more susceptible to infection with Leishmania mexicana, an effect reversed following treatment with the arginase inhibitor nor-NOHA. These findings show for the first time a role for MKP-2 in vivo and demonstrate that MKP-2 may be essential in orchestrating protection against intracellular infection at the level of the macrophage.
","In cells of the immune system are switch-on enzymes called kinases which regulate responses to infectious agents such as Leishmania. However, in the same cells there are switch-off enzymes known as phosphatases which function to turn off the kinases once they have done their work. A lot of studies have focussed on the role of kinases but not phosphatases in response to infection; we therefore generated a novel mouse in which the gene for one of these phosphatases, called MKP-2, has been deleted. We found that in the absence of this phosphatase unexpected things happened. The profile of inflammatory proteins, produced by a special cell of the immune system, called a macrophage, that functions to regulate infection by Leishmania, changed in ways which meant the macrophage could either fight infection very effectively or very weakly. In actual fact, we found that the macrophages with no MKP-2 fought off Leishmania poorly and mice deficient in MKP-2 had a modified immune response favouring the growth of the parasite. This is the first study to give critical insight into the role of MKP-2 in fighting Leishmania infection and demonstrates very well the importance of this class of enzyme in pathogen biology.

"Poxviruses contain large dsDNA genomes encoding numerous open reading frames that manipulate cellular signalling pathways and interfere with the host immune response. The NF-κB signalling cascade is an important mediator of innate immunity and inflammation, and is tightly regulated by ubiquitination at several key points. A critical step in NF-κB activation is the ubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor of kappaB (IκBα), by the cellular SCFβ-TRCP ubiquitin ligase complex. We show here that upon stimulation with TNFα or IL-1β, Orthopoxvirus-infected cells displayed an accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα, indicating that NF-κB activation was inhibited during poxvirus infection. Ectromelia virus is the causative agent of lethal mousepox, a natural disease that is fatal in mice. Previously, we identified a family of four ectromelia virus genes (EVM002, EVM005, EVM154 and EVM165) that contain N-terminal ankyrin repeats and C-terminal F-box domains that interact with the cellular SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Since degradation of IκBα is catalyzed by the SCFβ-TRCP ubiquitin ligase, we investigated the role of the ectromelia virus ankyrin/F-box protein, EVM005, in the regulation of NF-κB. Expression of Flag-EVM005 inhibited both TNFα- and IL-1β-stimulated IκBα degradation and p65 nuclear translocation. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by EVM005 was dependent on the F-box domain, and interaction with the SCF complex. Additionally, ectromelia virus devoid of EVM005 was shown to inhibit NF-κB activation, despite lacking the EVM005 open reading frame. Finally, ectromelia virus devoid of EVM005 was attenuated in both A/NCR and C57BL/6 mouse models, indicating that EVM005 is required for virulence and immune regulation in vivo.
","Poxviruses are large dsDNA viruses that are renowned for regulating cellular pathways and manipulating the host immune response, including the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB inhibition by poxviruses is a growing area of interest and this family of viruses has developed multiple mechanisms to manipulate the pathway. Here, we focus on regulation of the NF-κB pathway by ectromelia virus, the causative agent of mousepox. We demonstrate that ectromelia virus is a potent inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway. Previously, we identified a family of four ectromelia virus genes that contain N-terminal ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal F-box domain that interacts with the cellular SCF ubiquitin ligase. Significantly, expression of the ankyrin/F-box protein, EVM005, inhibited NF-κB, and the F-box domain was critical for NF-κB inhibition and interaction with the SCF complex. Ectromelia virus devoid of EVM005 still inhibited NF-κB, indicating that multiple gene products contribute to NF-κB inhibition. Importantly, mice infected with ectromelia virus lacking EVM005 had a robust immune response, leading to viral clearance during infection. The data present two mechanisms, one in which EVM005 inhibits NF-κB activation through manipulation of the host SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, and an additional, NF-κB-independent mechanism that drives virulence.

"Bacterial cyclic glucans are glucose polymers that concentrate within the periplasm of alpha-proteobacteria. These molecules are necessary to maintain the homeostasis of the cell envelope by contributing to the osmolarity of Gram negative bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that Brucella β 1,2 cyclic glucans are potent activators of human and mouse dendritic cells. Dendritic cells activation by Brucella β 1,2 cyclic glucans requires TLR4, MyD88 and TRIF, but not CD14. The Brucella cyclic glucans showed neither toxicity nor immunogenicity compared to LPS and triggered antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in vivo. These cyclic glucans also enhanced antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses including cross-presentation by different human DC subsets. Brucella β 1,2 cyclic glucans increased the memory CD4+ T cell responses of blood mononuclear cells exposed to recombinant fusion proteins composed of anti-CD40 antibody and antigens from both hepatitis C virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus cyclic glucans represent a new class of adjuvants, which might contribute to the development of effective antimicrobial therapies.
","Vaccination is one of the key strategies to fight against infectious diseases though numerous diseases remain without appropriate vaccines. The challenge is to generate potent vaccines capable of inducing long-lasting immunity in humans. Successful vaccines include adjuvants that enhance and appropriately skew the immune response to given antigens. The development of new adjuvants for human vaccines has become an expanding field of research. Here we show that bacterial cyclic β-glucans can be used to enhance cellular immunity by activation of dendritic cells, from both mice and humans. In particular, Cyclic-β glucans enhance the in vitro memory CD4+ T cell responses of patients suffering from hepatitis C and tuberculosis. Thus cyclic-β glucans are new adjuvants, which might be used in vaccines.

"Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection contributes to both B-cell and epithelial-cell malignancies. However, whether lytic EBV infection also contributes to tumors is unclear, although the association between malaria infection and Burkitt lymphomas (BLs) may involve excessive lytic EBV replication. A particular variant of the viral promoter (Zp) that controls lytic EBV reactivation is over-represented, relative to its frequency in non-malignant tissue, in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinomas and AIDS-related lymphomas. To date, no functional differences between the prototype Zp (Zp-P) and the cancer-associated variant (Zp-V3) have been identified. Here we show that a single nucleotide difference between the Zp-V3 and Zp-P promoters creates a binding site for the cellular transcription factor, NFATc1, in the Zp-V3 (but not Zp-P) variant, and greatly enhances Zp activity and lytic viral reactivation in response to NFATc1-inducing stimuli such as B-cell receptor activation and ionomycin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoring this NFATc1-motif to the Zp-P variant in the context of the intact EBV B95.8 strain genome greatly enhances lytic viral reactivation in response to the NFATc1-activating agent, ionomycin, and this effect is blocked by the NFAT inhibitory agent, cyclosporine, as well as NFATc1 siRNA. We also show that the Zp-V3 variant is over-represented in EBV-positive BLs and gastric cancers, and in EBV-transformed B-cell lines derived from EBV-infected breast milk of Kenyan mothers that had malaria during pregnancy. These results demonstrate that the Zp-V3 enhances EBV lytic reactivation to physiologically-relevant stimuli, and suggest that increased lytic infection may contribute to the increased prevalence of this variant in EBV-associated malignancies.
","Whether excessive lytic EBV infection increases the risk of EBV-induced cancers is not clear. A particular variant (Zp-V3) of the viral promoter driving expression of the EBV immediate-early BZLF1 (Z) protein that mediates lytic viral reactivation has been reported to be over-represented (relative to the prototype Zp-P form of the promoter) in certain EBV-positive malignancies, but no functional difference between the two promoter variants has been reported. Here we show that the malignancy-associated Zp-V3 variant (but not the Zp-P variant) contains a binding site for the cellular NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells c1) transcription factor that allows it to be activated by NFATc1-inducing stimuli such as B-cell receptor stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoring this NFATc1-motif to the Zp-P variant in the context of the intact EBV genome greatly enhances lytic viral reactivation in response to the NFATc1-inducing stimuli. We also find that the Zp-V3 variant is over-represented in EBV-positive Burkitt lymphomas and gastric carcinomas, and in lymphoblastoid cell lines transformed by EBV-infected breast milk of Kenyan mothers that had malaria during pregnancy. These findings suggest that the Zp-V3 version of the EBV BZLF1 promoter increases the likelihood of EBV-induced malignancies by increasing lytic EBV infection.

"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is prevalent and without adequate treatment usually follows a chronic course. “High-intensity” cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) from a specialist therapist is current “best practice.” However, access is difficult because of limited numbers of therapists and because of the disabling effects of OCD symptoms. There is a potential role for “low-intensity” interventions as part of a stepped care model. Low-intensity interventions (written or web-based materials with limited therapist support) can be provided remotely, which has the potential to increase access. However, current evidence concerning low-intensity interventions is insufficient. We aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness of 2 forms of low-intensity CBT prior to high-intensity CBT, in adults meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for OCD.
This study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West–Lancaster (reference number 11/NW/0276). All participants provided informed consent to take part in the trial. We conducted a 3-arm, multicentre randomised controlled trial in primary- and secondary-care United Kingdom mental health services. All patients were on a waiting list for therapist-led CBT (treatment as usual). Four hundred and seventy-three eligible patients were recruited and randomised. Patients had a median age of 33 years, and 60% were female. The majority were experiencing severe OCD. Patients received 1 of 2 low-intensity interventions: computerised CBT (cCBT; web-based CBT materials and limited telephone support) through “OCFighter” or guided self-help (written CBT materials with limited telephone or face-to-face support). Primary comparisons concerned OCD symptoms, measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale–Observer-Rated (Y-BOCS-OR) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, and functioning. At 3 months, guided self-help demonstrated modest benefits over the waiting list in reducing OCD symptoms (adjusted mean difference = −1.91, 95% CI −3.27 to −0.55). These effects did not reach a prespecified level of “clinically significant benefit.” cCBT did not demonstrate significant benefit (adjusted mean difference = −0.71, 95% CI −2.12 to 0.70). At 12 months, neither guided self-help nor cCBT led to differences in OCD symptoms. Early access to low-intensity interventions led to significant reductions in uptake of high-intensity CBT over 12 months; 86% of the patients allocated to the waiting list for high-intensity CBT started treatment by the end of the trial, compared to 62% in supported cCBT and 57% in guided self-help. These reductions did not compromise longer-term patient outcomes. Data suggested small differences in satisfaction at 3 months, with patients more satisfied with guided self-help than supported cCBT. A significant issue in the interpretation of the results concerns the level of access to high-intensity CBT before the primary outcome assessment.
We have demonstrated that providing low-intensity interventions does not lead to clinically significant benefits but may reduce uptake of therapist-led CBT.

","Many people suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and if they do not get treatment, it can be a long-term problem.
Although cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) with a therapist is effective, many people struggle to get access because of limited numbers of therapists.
Low-intensity versions of CBT (written or web-based materials with limited therapist support) may increase access to care, but evidence of their effectiveness is limited.
We tested 2 low-intensity versions of CBT in a trial (guided self-help and supported computerised cognitive-behaviour therapy [cCBT]), testing their impact on patients with OCD when provided prior to CBT with a therapist.
Neither low-intensity version of CBT led to clinically significant benefits in patient outcomes.
Access to “low-intensity” interventions led to significant reductions in uptake of CBT with a therapist over 12 months.
More patients were satisfied with guided self-help than supported cCBT.
Providing low-intensity interventions does not lead to clinically significant benefits but may reduce uptake of therapist-led CBT.
These findings from a large pragmatic trial showing no clinical benefit from low-intensity treatments are in contrast to other studies published recently.

"Transmission of malaria parasites relies on the formation of a specialized blood form called the gametocyte. Gametocytes of the human pathogen, Plasmodium falciparum, adopt a crescent shape. Their dramatic morphogenesis is driven by the assembly of a network of microtubules and an underpinning inner membrane complex (IMC). Using super-resolution optical and electron microscopies we define the ultrastructure of the IMC at different stages of gametocyte development. We characterize two new proteins of the gametocyte IMC, called PhIL1 and PIP1. Genetic disruption of PhIL1 or PIP1 ablates elongation and prevents formation of transmission-ready mature gametocytes. The maturation defect is accompanied by failure to form an enveloping IMC and a marked swelling of the digestive vacuole, suggesting PhIL1 and PIP1 are required for correct membrane trafficking. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry we reveal that PhIL1 interacts with known and new components of the gametocyte IMC.
","Transmission of the malaria parasite from humans to mosquitoes relies on the formation of the specialised blood stage gametocyte. Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes mature over about 10 days, during which time they undergo a remarkable morphological transformation, eventually adopting a characteristic crescent shape. The shape changes are thought to facilitate the mechanical sequestration of maturing gametocytes within the bone marrow and spleen, as well as the eventual release into the circulation. Failure to mature correctly leads to a failure to transmit. Despite the importance of this process, little is known about the molecular basis of elongation. In this work, we introduce 3D Electron Microscopy of P. falciparum gametocytes and use it, in a combination with super-resolution optical microscopy, to elucidate the genesis and expansion of the molecular structures that drive gametocyte elongation. We use protein interaction profiling to identify some of the proteins that help drive the shape change and employ inducible gene knockdown strategies to show that these proteins play a role in remodeling membranes, and are needed for gametocyte elongation. This work points to potential targets for the development of transmission-blocking therapies.

"We have taken an engineering approach to extending the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. Aging stands out as a complex trait, because events that occur in old animals are not under strong natural selection. As a result, lifespan can be lengthened rationally using bioengineering to modulate gene expression or to add exogenous components. Here, we engineered longer lifespan by expressing genes from zebrafish encoding molecular functions not normally present in worms. Additionally, we extended lifespan by increasing the activity of four endogenous worm aging pathways. Next, we used a modular approach to extend lifespan by combining components. Finally, we used cell- and worm-based assays to analyze changes in cell physiology and as a rapid means to evaluate whether multi-component transgenic lines were likely to have extended longevity. Using engineering to add novel functions and to tune endogenous functions provides a new framework for lifespan extension that goes beyond the constraints of the worm genome.
","We used bioengineering to extend the lifespan of C. elegans by expressing genes acting in critical aging pathways. We overexpressed five genes that act in endogenous worm aging pathways, as well as two genes from zebrafish encoding molecular functions not normally present in worms. For example, we used zebrafish genes to alter mitochondrial function and innate immunity in ways not normally available to C. elegans and extended worm lifespan by ∼40%. Next, we used a modular approach to extend lifespan by 130% by combining up to four components in the same strain. These results provide a platform to build worms having progressively longer lifespans. This project is conceptually similar to using engineering to increase the useful lifespan of a primitive machine (1931 Model T) using both parts from the model T as well as parts from a more advanced machine (2012 Toyota Corolla). Our results open the door to use engineering to go beyond the constraints of the C. elegans genome to extend its lifespan by adding non-native components.

"Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent for melioidosis, has become a public health problem in India and across the world. Melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose because of the inconsistent clinical presentations of the disease. This study aims to determine the genetic diversity among the clinical isolates of B. pseudomaelli from India in order to establish a molecular epidemiology and elucidate the Southeast Asian association.
Molecular typing using multi locus sequence typing was performed on thirty one archived B. pseudomallei clinical isolates, previously characterised from specimens obtained from patients admitted to the Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore from 2015 to 2016. Further investigations into the genetic heterogeneity and evolution at a regional and global level were performed using insilico tools.
Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) of the isolates from systemic and localized forms of melioidosis, including blood, pus, tissue, and urine specimens, revealed twenty isolates with novel sequence types and eleven with previously reported sequence types. High genetic diversity was observed using MLST with a strong association within the Southeast Asian region.
Molecular typing of B. pseudomallei clinical isolates using MLST revealed high genetic diversity and provided a baseline molecular epidemiology of the disease in India with a strong Southeast Asian association of the strains. Future studies should focus on whole genome based Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphism (SNP) which has the advantage of a high discriminatory power, to further understand the novel sequence types reported in this study.
","Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram negative bacteria, is the causative agent for melioidosis. Annually, around 165,000 people suffer from melioidosis worldwide. B. pseudomallei is present in wet soil and stagnant water. It enters the human body via percutaneous inoculation, inhalation, aspiration, and occasionally ingestion. Clinical presentations of B. pseudomallei vary by geographical region. Melioidosis occurs predominantly in Southeast Asia, northern Australia, South Asia (including India), and China. Occasional cases occur in other countries around the world. Melioidosis has become a public health problem in India, due to the increasing numbers of people affected in various parts of the country. This study provides baseline data on the genetic diversity among B. pseudomallei isolates from different clinical samples (blood, pus, tissue and urine) of patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital using signature nucleotide sequences via multi locus sequence typing (MLST). Further, this study shows a relationship among B. pseudomallei previously reported in various Southeast Asian countries over the years from 1935 and 1947 with those seen in current clinical cases.

"Support of ageing neurons by endogenous neurotrophic factors such as glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may determine whether the neurons resist or succumb to neurodegeneration. GDNF has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. BDNF modulates nigrostriatal functions and rescues DA neurons in PD animal models. The physiological roles of GDNF and BDNF signaling in the adult nigrostriatal DA system are unknown. We generated mice with regionally selective ablations of the genes encoding the receptors for GDNF (Ret) and BDNF (TrkB). We find that Ret, but not TrkB, ablation causes progressive and adult-onset loss of DA neurons specifically in the substantia nigra pars compacta, degeneration of DA nerve terminals in striatum, and pronounced glial activation. These findings establish Ret as a critical regulator of long-term maintenance of the nigrostriatal DA system and suggest conditional Ret mutants as useful tools for gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of PD.
","What does a neuron need to survive? Our body produces its own survival factors for neurons, so-called neurotrophic factors, which have additional roles in neuron differentiation, growth, and function. Declining production of a neurotrophic factor or impaired signal transduction in ageing neurons may contribute to pathological neurodegeneration in humans. Glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been suggested as survival factors for midbrain dopaminergic neurons, a group of neurons primarily affected in Parkinson disease.
To investigate the physiological requirements for GDNF and BDNF to establish and maintain an important output pathway of these neurons—the nigrostriatal pathway—in the intact brain, we generated mutant mice with regionally selective ablations of the receptors for these survival factors, Ret (receptor of GDNF and related family members) or TrkB (BDNF receptor). Surprisingly, these mice survive to adulthood and show normal development and maturation of the nigrostriatal system. However, in ageing mice, ablation of Ret leads to a progressive and cell-type–specific loss of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons and their projections into the striatum. Our findings establish Ret and subsequent downstream effectors as critical regulators of long-term maintenance of the nigrostriatal system.

"The repeat region of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is a major vaccine antigen because it can be targeted by parasite neutralizing antibodies; however, little is known about this interaction. We used isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis-validated modeling to analyze the binding of a murine neutralizing antibody to Plasmodium falciparum CSP. Strikingly, we found that the repeat region of CSP is bound by multiple antibodies. This repeating pattern allows multiple weak interactions of single FAB domains to accumulate and yield a complex with a dissociation constant in the low nM range. Because the CSP protein can potentially cross-link multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) we hypothesized that the B cell response might be T cell independent. However, while there was a modest response in mice deficient in T cell help, the bulk of the response was T cell dependent. By sequencing the BCRs of CSP-repeat specific B cells in inbred mice we found that these cells underwent somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation indicative of a T-dependent response. Last, we found that the BCR repertoire of responding B cells was limited suggesting that the structural simplicity of the repeat may limit the breadth of the immune response.
","Vaccines aim to protect by inducing the immune system to make molecules called antibodies that can recognize molecules on the surface of invading pathogens. In the case of malaria, our most advanced vaccine candidates aim to promote the production of antibodies that recognize the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) molecule on the surface of the invasive parasite stage called the sporozoite. In this report we use X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of CSP-binding antibodies at the atomic level. We use other techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry and structural modeling to examine how this antibody interacts with the CSP molecule. Strikingly, we found that each CSP molecule could bind 6 antibodies. This finding has implications for the immune response and may explain why high titers of antibody are needed for protection. Moreover, because the structure of the CSP repeat is quite simple we determined that the number of different kinds of antibodies that could bind this molecule are quite small. However a high avidity interaction between those antibodies and CSP can result from a process called affinity maturation that allows the body to learn how to make improved antibodies specific for pathogen molecules. These data show that while it is challenging for the immune system to recognize and neutralize CSP, it should be possible to generate viable vaccines targeting this molecule.

"DNA mismatch repair suppresses gastrointestinal tumorgenesis. Four mammalian E. coli MutL homologues heterodimerize to form three distinct complexes: MLH1/PMS2, MLH1/MLH3, and MLH1/PMS1. To understand the mechanistic contributions of MLH3 and PMS2 in gastrointestinal tumor suppression, we generated Mlh3−/−;Apc1638N and Mlh3−/−;Pms2−/−;Apc1638N (MPA) mice. Mlh3 nullizygosity significantly increased Apc frameshift mutations and tumor multiplicity. Combined Mlh3;Pms2 nullizygosity further increased Apc base-substitution mutations. The spectrum of MPA tumor mutations was distinct from that observed in Mlh1−/−;Apc1638N mice, implicating the first potential role for MLH1/PMS1 in tumor suppression. Because Mlh3;Pms2 deficiency also increased gastrointestinal tumor progression, we used array-CGH to identify a recurrent tumor amplicon. This amplicon contained a previously uncharacterized Transducin enhancer of Split (Tle) family gene, Tle6-like. Expression of Tle6-like, or the similar human TLE6D splice isoform in colon cancer cells increased cell proliferation, colony-formation, cell migration, and xenograft tumorgenicity. Tle6-like;TLE6D directly interact with the gastrointestinal tumor suppressor RUNX3 and antagonize RUNX3 target transactivation. TLE6D is recurrently overexpressed in human colorectal cancers and TLE6D expression correlates with RUNX3 expression. Collectively, these findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of individual MutL homologue tumor suppression and demonstrate an association between TLE mediated antagonism of RUNX3 and accelerated human colorectal cancer progression.
","Approximately one million people every year are diagnosed with colorectal cancer worldwide, and about five hundred thousand of these people subsequently perish from the disease. Colorectal cancer is thought to develop through a series of early and later stages (called cancer initiation and progression, respectively). Deaths from colorectal cancer are particularly tragic because the disease can usually be cured if discovered before full-blown progression. However, our knowledge of how these tumors progress remains very limited. DNA mismatch repair is known to be an important process in preventing ∼15% of colorectal cancer initiation. In this study we describe how two of these genes (Mlh3 and Pms2) that have partial functional redundancy and therefore individually are rarely mutated are also important in preventing colorectal cancer progression. Additionally, we describe a new gene (Tle6-like) that, when overactive, makes these cancers progress more rapidly. The overall goal of this study is to understand colorectal cancer progression better so that we can come up with new ways to block it at the later stage.

"Existing theory of host-parasite interactions has identified the genetic specificity of interaction as a key variable affecting the outcome of coevolution. The Matching Alleles (MA) and Gene For Gene (GFG) models have been extensively studied as the canonical examples of specific and non-specific interaction. The generality of these models has recently been challenged by uncovering real-world host-parasite systems exhibiting specificity patterns that fit neither MA nor GFG, and by the discovery of symbiotic bacteria protecting insect hosts against parasites. In the present paper we address both challenges, simulating a large number of non-canonical models of host-parasite interactions that explicitly incorporate symbiont-based host resistance. To assess the genetic specialisation in these hybrid models, we develop a quantitative index of specificity applicable to any coevolutionary model based on a fitness matrix. We find qualitative and quantitative effects of host-parasite and symbiont-parasite specificities on genotype frequency dynamics, allele survival, and mean host and parasite fitnesses.
","Coevolution between hosts and parasites is believed to be central to a number of biological phenomena, most notably the observed patterns of biodiversity and the origins of sexual reproduction. However, classical mathematical models of host-parasite coevolution account neither for the hosts' use of bacterial symbionts for protection from parasites, nor for the potential and observed complexity of genetic interactions between the coevolving species. In this article we address both challenges by simulating a large number of models of host-symbiont-parasite coevolution based on randomly generated genotype interaction patterns. We demonstrate that the degree of “specificity” between the genotypes of the interacting species is a major factor influencing the outcome of coevolution. We also observe that the symbionts may take over from the hosts the coevolutionary arms race against the parasites. Overall, our results make clear that the complex interaction patterns and the defensive symbionts can both play vital roles in host-parasite coevolution. An additional contribution of the article is a numerical index of specificity, applicable to a wide range of existing and future coevolutionary models.

"Dominant Vγ2Vδ2 T-cell subset exist only in primates, and recognize phosphoantigen from selected pathogens including M. tuberculosis(Mtb). In vivo function of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells in tuberculosis remains unknown. We conducted mechanistic studies to determine whether earlier expansion/differentiation of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells during Mtb infection could increase immune resistance to tuberculosis in macaques. Phosphoantigen/IL-2 administration specifically induced major expansion and pulmonary trafficking/accumulation of phosphoantigen-specific Vγ2Vδ2 T cells, significantly reduced Mtb burdens and attenuated tuberculosis lesions in lung tissues compared to saline/BSA or IL-2 controls. Expanded Vγ2Vδ2 T cells differentiated into multifunctional effector subpopulations capable of producing anti-TB cytokines IFNγ, perforin and granulysin, and co-producing perforin/granulysin in lung tissue. Mechanistically, perforin/granulysin-producing Vγ2Vδ2 T cells limited intracellular Mtb growth, and macaque granulysin had Mtb-bactericidal effect, and inhibited intracellular Mtb in presence of perforin. Furthermore, phosphoantigen/IL2-expanded Vγ2Vδ2 T effector cells produced IL-12, and their expansion/differentiation led to enhanced pulmonary responses of peptide-specific CD4+/CD8+ Th1-like cells. These results provide first in vivo evidence implicating that early expansion/differentiation of Vγ2Vδ2 T effector cells during Mtb infection increases resistance to tuberculosis. Thus, data support a rationale for conducting further studies of the γδ T-cell-targeted treatment of established TB, which might ultimately help explore single or adjunctive phosphoantigen expansion of Vγ2Vδ2 T-cell subset as intervention of MDR-tuberculosis or HIV-related tuberculosis.
","Tuberculosis(TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb), remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While CD4+/CD8+ T cells are protective, role of γδ T cells in TB and other infections remains unknown in humans. Vγ2Vδ2 T cells exist only in primates, represent a dominant circulating γδ T-cell subpopulation, and recognize phosphoantigen from Mtb and some selected pathogens. Here, we determined whether earlier expansion/differentiation of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells during Mtb infection increased resistance to TB in macaques. Phosphoantigen plus IL-2 administration induced expansion and pulmonary accumulation of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells, significantly reduced Mtb counts and attenuated TB lesions in lung tissues. Expanded Vγ2Vδ2 T cells produced anti-TB cytokines IFNγ, perforin and granulysin, and co-produced perforin and granulysin in lung tissue. Perforin/granulysin-co-producing Vγ2Vδ2 T cells limited intracellular Mtb growth, and macaque granulysin killed Mtb bacteria, and inhibited intracellular Mtb in presence of perforin. Furthermore, expansion of Vγ2Vδ2 T effectors enhanced pulmonary responses of peptide-specific CD4+/CD8+ T cells, which correlated with the ability of Vγ2Vδ2 T effector cells to produce IL-12. These results provide first evidence implicating a protective role of Vγ2Vδ2 T effector cells in TB, supporting a rationale to explore Vγ2Vδ2 T-cell-targeted treatment of drug-resistant TB or HIV-related TB.

"HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission allows for 2–3 orders of magnitude more efficient viral spread than cell-free dissemination. The high local multiplicity of infection (MOI) observed at cell-cell contact sites may lower the efficacy of antiretroviral therapies (ART). Here we test the efficacy of commonly used antiretroviral inhibitors against cell-to-cell and cell-free HIV-1 transmission. We demonstrate that, while some nucleoside-analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are less effective against HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission, most non-nucleoside-analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), entry inhibitors and protease inhibitors remain highly effective. Moreover, poor NRTIs become highly effective when applied in combinations explaining the effectiveness of ART in clinical settings. Investigating the underlying mechanism, we observe a strict correlation between the ability of individual drugs and combinations of drugs to interfere with HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission, and their effectiveness against high viral MOIs. Our results suggest that the ability to suppress high viral MOI is a feature of effective ART regimens and this parameter should be considered when designing novel antiviral therapies.
","HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission has gained interest due to its potential role in AIDS pathogenesis. It has recently been suggested that antiretroviral therapies fail during cell-to-cell transmission because of the high number of particles transferred at sites of cell-cell contacts. However, these findings stand in contrast with the clinical observation that ART is successful in suppressing retroviral replication in HIV-positive patients. Consequently, many interpreted this observation to suggest that HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is not clinically relevant. Here we show that this interpretation is likely incorrect. By systematically testing the efficacy of commonly used antiretroviral inhibitors against cell-to-cell and cell-free HIV-1 transmission, we demonstrate that, while some NRTIs are less effective, most NNRTIs, entry inhibitors and protease inhibitors remain highly effective. Moreover, NRTIs become highly effective when combined, thus supporting the known effectiveness of HAART in clinical settings. Interestingly, the ability of individual drugs and combinations to interfere with HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission correlates with their effectiveness against high viral MOIs. Our results suggest that the ability to suppress the high viral MOI during HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is a critical feature of existing ART regimens that should be tested when designing novel antiviral therapies.

"Broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) isolated from infected subjects display protective potential in animal models. Their elicitation by immunization is thus highly desirable. The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole viral target of bnAbs, but is also targeted by binding, non-neutralizing antibodies. Env-based immunogens tested so far in various animal species and humans have elicited binding and autologous neutralizing antibodies but not bNAbs (with a few notable exceptions). The underlying reasons for this are not well understood despite intensive efforts to characterize the binding specificities of the elicited antibodies; mostly by employing serologic methodologies and monoclonal antibody isolation and characterization. These approaches provide limited information on the ontogenies and clonal B cell lineages that expand following Env-immunization. Thus, our current understanding on how the expansion of particular B cell lineages by Env may be linked to the development of non-neutralizing antibodies is limited. Here, in addition to serological analysis, we employed high-throughput BCR sequence analysis from the periphery, lymph nodes and bone marrow, as well as B cell- and antibody-isolation and characterization methods, to compare in great detail the B cell and antibody responses elicited in non-human primates by two forms of the clade C HIV Env 426c: one representing the full length extracellular portion of Env while the other lacking the variable domains 1, 2 and 3 and three conserved N-linked glycosylation sites. The two forms were equally immunogenic, but only the latter elicited neutralizing antibodies by stimulating a more restricted expansion of B cells to a narrower set of IGH/IGK/IGL-V genes that represented a small fraction (0.003–0.02%) of total B cells. Our study provides new information on how Env antigenic differences drastically affect the expansion of particular B cell lineages and supports immunogen-design efforts aiming at stimulating the expansion of cells expressing particular B cell receptors.
","Broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) display protective potentials against experimental animal infection and thus are believed to be a key component of an effective HIV vaccine. bNAbs are derived from B cells that express B cell receptors formed by specific VH/VL alleles. We report that the variable domains of recombinant HIV-1 Env immunogens activate a large number of B cell clones that give rise to many non-neutralizing antibodies, and that removing the variable domains from the immunogen reduces the number of activated B cell lineages and leads to the development of autologous neutralizing antibodies, a step towards bNAb-production. Our findings shed new light into how HIV-1 evades detection from B cells that can produce bNAbs and also provides information that is relevant for the design of optimal immunization strategies.

"Progress in epigenetics has revealed mechanisms that can heritably regulate gene function independent of genetic alterations. Nevertheless, little is known about the role of epigenetics in evolution. This is due in part to scant data on epigenetic variation among natural populations. In plants, small interfering RNA (siRNA) is involved in both the initiation and maintenance of gene silencing by directing DNA methylation and/or histone methylation. Here, we report that, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a cluster of ∼24 nt siRNAs found at high levels in the ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler) could direct DNA methylation and heterochromatinization at a hAT element adjacent to the promoter of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a major repressor of flowering, whereas the same hAT element in ecotype Columbia (Col) with almost identical DNA sequence, generates a set of low abundance siRNAs that do not direct these activities. We have called this hAT element MPF for Methylated region near Promoter of FLC, although de novo methylation triggered by an inverted repeat transgene at this region in Col does not alter its FLC expression. DNA methylation of the Ler allele MPF is dependent on genes in known silencing pathways, and such methylation is transmissible to Col by genetic crosses, although with varying degrees of penetrance. A genome-wide comparison of Ler and Col small RNAs identified at least 68 loci matched by a significant level of ∼24 nt siRNAs present specifically in Ler but not Col, where nearly half of the loci are related to repeat or TE sequences. Methylation analysis revealed that 88% of the examined loci (37 out of 42) were specifically methylated in Ler but not Col, suggesting that small RNA can direct epigenetic differences between two closely related Arabidopsis ecotypes.
","Phenotypic variation has been mainly attributed to their differences in genetic materials, i.e., the DNA sequence. The advances in Epigenetics in past decades has revealed it as a fundamental mechanism that could inheritably influence gene function without change in DNA sequence, but by modulating chemical modifications on DNA itself (methylation), or on histone proteins, which package the DNA further into nucleosome. Nevertheless, the roles of epigenetic regulation in natural variation were not explored much because of the limitation in high-throughput analytical tools. A recent study in model plant Arabidopsis showed that there are many DNA methylation polymorphisms between the two ecotypes. In plant, a subset of RNA named small interfering RNA (siRNA), is capable of triggering the epigenetic modifications on DNA or histone at their target region with complementary nucleotide sequences. Here, we took a view from the small RNA side and by applying molecular and bioinformatic approaches we showed that the same region could be led to a different epigenetic status because of the difference in their corresponding small RNA abundance and between the two closely related Arabidopsis ecotypes, suggesting that there could be small RNA-directed epigenetic differences among natural populations.

"Insecticidal crystal toxins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are widely used as biopesticide sprays or expressed in transgenic crops to control insect pests. However, large-scale use of Bt has led to field-evolved resistance in several lepidopteran pests. Resistance to Bt Cry1Ac toxin in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), was previously mapped to a multigenic resistance locus (BtR-1). Here, we assembled the 3.15 Mb BtR-1 locus and found high-level resistance to Cry1Ac and Bt biopesticide in four independent P. xylostella strains were all associated with differential expression of a midgut membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP) outside this locus and a suite of ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C (ABCC) genes inside this locus. The interplay between these resistance genes is controlled by a previously uncharacterized trans-regulatory mechanism via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Molecular, biochemical, and functional analyses have established ALP as a functional Cry1Ac receptor. Phenotypic association experiments revealed that the recessive Cry1Ac resistance was tightly linked to down-regulation of ALP, ABCC2 and ABCC3, whereas it was not linked to up-regulation of ABCC1. Silencing of ABCC2 and ABCC3 in susceptible larvae reduced their susceptibility to Cry1Ac but did not affect the expression of ALP, whereas suppression of MAP4K4, a constitutively transcriptionally-activated MAPK upstream gene within the BtR-1 locus, led to a transient recovery of gene expression thereby restoring the susceptibility in resistant larvae. These results highlight a crucial role for ALP and ABCC genes in field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ac and reveal a novel trans-regulatory signaling mechanism responsible for modulating the expression of these pivotal genes in P. xylostella.
","Biopesticide and transgenic crops based on Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry toxins are widely used worldwide, yet the development of field resistance seriously threatens their sustainability. Unraveling these resistance mechanisms are of great importance for delaying insect field resistance evolution. The diamondback moth was the first insect to evolve field resistance to Bt biopesticides and it is an excellent model for the study of Bt resistance mechanisms. In this work, we present strong empirical evidence supporting that (1) field-evolved resistance to Bt in P. xylostella is tightly associated with differential expression of a membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and a suite of ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C (ABCC) genes, and (2) a constitutively transcriptionally-activated upstream gene (MAP4K4) in the MAPK signaling pathway is responsible for this trans-regulatory signaling mechanism. These findings identify key resistance genes and provide the first comprehensive mechanistic description responsible for the field-evolved Bt resistance in P. xylostella. Given that expression alterations of multiple receptor genes result in Bt resistance in many other insects, it can now be tested to determine whether the previously unidentified trans-regulatory mechanism characterized in this study is also involved in these cases.

"Sole reliance on one drug, Praziquantel, for treatment and control of schistosomiasis raises concerns about development of widespread resistance, prompting renewed interest in the discovery of new anthelmintics. To discover new leads we designed an automated label-free, high content-based, high throughput screen (HTS) to assess drug-induced effects on in vitro cultured larvae (schistosomula) using bright-field imaging. Automatic image analysis and Bayesian prediction models define morphological damage, hit/non-hit prediction and larval phenotype characterization. Motility was also assessed from time-lapse images. In screening a 10,041 compound library the HTS correctly detected 99.8% of the hits scored visually. A proportion of these larval hits were also active in an adult worm ex-vivo screen and are the subject of ongoing studies. The method allows, for the first time, screening of large compound collections against schistosomes and the methods are adaptable to other whole organism and cell-based screening by morphology and motility phenotyping.
","Schistosomiasis is a severe helminth infection affecting an estimated 600 million people. The one drug widely available, praziquantel (PZQ), is not ideal. PZQ kills the adult worms but not the developing juveniles so the treated patient may not be cured long-term. In addition, use of repeated mass treatment campaigns with PZQ to control morbidity raises concerns about the development of drug resistance. Our work is aimed at providing starting points for drug discovery programs for schistosomiasis by screening large compound libraries against whole organisms. Praziquantel and several other known anti-schistosomal drugs are also active in vitro against the adult worms and the larval stages, schistosomula. The latter are ideal for novel drug screening as they can be produced in large numbers in vitro, are small and so are amenable to screening in microwell plates. Drug activity can be assessed visually but this is subjective and laborious. We have built an automated system for assessing drug action involving the collection of images of the larvae and the development of computer algorithms to analyze their morphology and motility, defining them as ""hits"" or ""nonhits."" The method is reliable, consistent and efficient, making it feasible, for the first time, to screen large compound collections.

"Chagas disease is a chronic parasitic infection that progresses to dilated cardiomyopathy in 30% of human cases. Public health efforts target diagnosing asymptomatic cases, as therapeutic efficacy diminishes as irreversible tissue damage progresses. Physician diagnosis of Chagas disease cases in the United States is low, partially due to lack of awareness of the potential burden in the United States.
The current study tested a patient cohort of 1,196 Starr County, Texas residents using the Hemagen Chagas ELISA Kit as a preliminary screening assay. Samples testing positive using the Hemagen test were subjected to additional confirmatory tests. Two patients (0.17%) without previous Chagas disease diagnosis were identified; both had evidence of acquiring disease in the United States or along the Texas-Mexico border.
The Texas-Mexico border is a foci of Chagas disease human cases, with a local disease burden potentially twice the national estimate of Hispanic populations. It is imperative that physicians consider persons with residential histories along the Texas-Mexico border for Chagas disease testing.
","Chagas disease is a parasitic infection, which in 30% of people results in chronic dilated organomegaly over the course of decades. This progressive disease typically advances subclinically until end stage heart failure is established, at which point treatment is no longer efficacious. Thus, current public health efforts target screening of high-risk populations for early disease detection and clinical management for improved health outcomes. Although historical evidence suggests the Texas-Mexico border as a region with high Chagas disease prevalence, surveillance is nonexistent. Our study indicates this region likely has an increased risk for undiagnosed morbidity. Furthermore, occupational histories were highlighted as key risk factors for both cases in this report. Physicians should consider Chagas screening in persons with residential histories along the Texas-Mexico border.

"Pathogenic members of the genus Leptospira are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a neglected disease of public and veterinary health concern. Leptospirosis is a systemic disease that in its severest forms leads to renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, and pulmonary failure. Many strains of Leptospira produce hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities, and a number of candidate leptospiral hemolysins have been identified based on sequence similarity to well-characterized bacterial hemolysins. Five of the putative hemolysins are sphingomyelinase paralogs. Although recombinant forms of the sphingomyelinase Sph2 and other hemolysins lyse erythrocytes, none have been demonstrated to contribute to the hemolytic activity secreted by leptospiral cells. In this study, we examined the regulation of sph2 and its relationship to hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities produced by several L. interrogans strains cultivated under the osmotic conditions found in the mammalian host. The sph2 gene was poorly expressed when the Fiocruz L1-130 (serovar Copenhageni), 56601 (sv. Lai), and L495 (sv. Manilae) strains were cultivated in the standard culture medium EMJH. Raising EMJH osmolarity to physiological levels with sodium chloride enhanced Sph2 production in all three strains. In addition, the Pomona subtype kennewicki strain LC82-25 produced substantially greater amounts of Sph2 during standard EMJH growth than the other strains, and sph2 expression increased further by addition of salt. When 10% rat serum was present in EMJH along with the sodium chloride supplement, Sph2 production increased further in all strains. Osmotic regulation and differences in basal Sph2 production in the Manilae L495 and Pomona strains correlated with the levels of secreted hemolysin and sphingomyelinase activities. Finally, a transposon insertion in sph2 dramatically reduced hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities during incubation of L. interrogans at physiologic osmolarity. Complementation of the mutation with the sph2 gene partially restored production of hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities. These results indicate that the sph2 gene product contributes to the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans and most likely dominates those functions under the culture condition tested.
","The spirochete Leptospira causes leptospirosis, a potentially deadly disease of humans and animals. Candidate factors that promote infection include hemolysins encoded by several leptospiral genes. Hemolysins rupture red blood cells in vitro. Some hemolysins are sphingomyelinases, which target sphingomyelin in the host cell membrane. Hemolysins have the potential to disrupt organ function during infection. It is not known which hemolysins and sphingomyelinases are responsible for the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans. We found that the production of hemolytic activity is regulated and is tied to expression of sph2, which encodes a hemolysin with sphingomyelinase, cytotoxic, and fibronectin-binding activities. Hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities and sph2 expression were higher when the osmolarity of the culture medium was raised to the level found in the mammalian host. Similarly, sph2 expression was substantially higher in an L. interrogans strain that secreted large amounts of hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities than in a strain that generated negligible amounts. Most importantly, disruption of the sph2 gene eliminated hemolysin production and yielded substantially less sphingomyelinase than the wild-type strain. Our findings indicate that sph2 is a major contributor to the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans and that the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities measured in standard L. interrogans cultures may underestimate the levels produced during infection.

"Many accounts of decision making and reinforcement learning posit the existence of two distinct systems that control choice: a fast, automatic system and a slow, deliberative system. Recent research formalizes this distinction by mapping these systems to “model-free” and “model-based” strategies in reinforcement learning. Model-free strategies are computationally cheap, but sometimes inaccurate, because action values can be accessed by inspecting a look-up table constructed through trial-and-error. In contrast, model-based strategies compute action values through planning in a causal model of the environment, which is more accurate but also more cognitively demanding. It is assumed that this trade-off between accuracy and computational demand plays an important role in the arbitration between the two strategies, but we show that the hallmark task for dissociating model-free and model-based strategies, as well as several related variants, do not embody such a trade-off. We describe five factors that reduce the effectiveness of the model-based strategy on these tasks by reducing its accuracy in estimating reward outcomes and decreasing the importance of its choices. Based on these observations, we describe a version of the task that formally and empirically obtains an accuracy-demand trade-off between model-free and model-based strategies. Moreover, we show that human participants spontaneously increase their reliance on model-based control on this task, compared to the original paradigm. Our novel task and our computational analyses may prove important in subsequent empirical investigations of how humans balance accuracy and demand.
","When you make a choice about what groceries to get for dinner, you can rely on two different strategies. You can make your choice by relying on habit, simply buying the items you need to make a meal that is second nature to you. However, you can also plan your actions in a more deliberative way, realizing that the friend who will join you is a vegetarian, and therefore you should not make the burgers that have become a staple in your cooking. These two strategies differ in how computationally demanding and accurate they are. While the habitual strategy is less computationally demanding (costs less effort and time), the deliberative strategy is more accurate. Scientists have been able to study the distinction between these strategies using a task that allows them to measure how much people rely on habit and planning strategies. Interestingly, we have discovered that in this task, the deliberative strategy does not increase performance accuracy, and hence does not induce a trade-off between accuracy and demand. We describe why this happens, and improve the task so that it embodies an accuracy-demand trade-off, providing evidence for theories of cost-based arbitration between cognitive strategies.

"We introduce a flexible and robust simulation-based framework to infer demographic parameters from the site frequency spectrum (SFS) computed on large genomic datasets. We show that our composite-likelihood approach allows one to study evolutionary models of arbitrary complexity, which cannot be tackled by other current likelihood-based methods. For simple scenarios, our approach compares favorably in terms of accuracy and speed with , the current reference in the field, while showing better convergence properties for complex models. We first apply our methodology to non-coding genomic SNP data from four human populations. To infer their demographic history, we compare neutral evolutionary models of increasing complexity, including unsampled populations. We further show the versatility of our framework by extending it to the inference of demographic parameters from SNP chips with known ascertainment, such as that recently released by Affymetrix to study human origins. Whereas previous ways of handling ascertained SNPs were either restricted to a single population or only allowed the inference of divergence time between a pair of populations, our framework can correctly infer parameters of more complex models including the divergence of several populations, bottlenecks and migration. We apply this approach to the reconstruction of African demography using two distinct ascertained human SNP panels studied under two evolutionary models. The two SNP panels lead to globally very similar estimates and confidence intervals, and suggest an ancient divergence (>110 Ky) between Yoruba and San populations. Our methodology appears well suited to the study of complex scenarios from large genomic data sets.
","We present a new likelihood-based method to infer the past demography of a set of populations from large genomic datasets. Our method can be applied to arbitrarily complex models as the likelihood is estimated by coalescent simulations. Under simple scenarios, our method behaves similarly to a widely used diffusion-based method while showing better convergence properties. In addition, our approach can be applied to very complex models including as many as a dozen populations, and still retrieve parameters very accurately in a reasonable time. We apply our approach to estimate the past demography of four human populations for which non-coding whole genome diversity is available, estimating the degree of European admixture of a southwest African American population and that of a Kenyan population with an unsampled East African population. We also show the versatility of our framework by inferring the demographic history of African populations from SNP chip data with known ascertainment bias, and find a very old divergence time (>110 Ky) between Yorubas from Western Africa and Sans from Southern Africa.

"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of synthesis of secreted and membrane proteins. To exit the ER, proteins are packaged into COPII vesicles through direct interaction with the COPII coat or aided by specific cargo receptors. Despite the fundamental role of such cargo receptors in protein traffic, only a few have been identified; their cargo spectrum is unknown and the signals they recognize remain poorly understood. We present here an approach we term “PAIRS” (pairing analysis of cargo receptors), which combines systematic genetic manipulations of yeast with automated microscopy screening, to map the spectrum of cargo for a known receptor or to uncover a novel receptor for a particular cargo. Using PAIRS we followed the fate of ∼150 cargos on the background of mutations in nine putative cargo receptors and identified novel cargo for most of these receptors. Deletion of the Erv14 cargo receptor affected the widest range of cargo. Erv14 substrates have a wide array of functions and structures; however, they are all membrane-spanning proteins of the late secretory pathway or plasma membrane. Proteins residing in these organelles have longer transmembrane domains (TMDs). Detailed examination of one cargo supported the hypothesis that Erv14 dependency reflects the length rather than the sequence of the TMD. The PAIRS approach allowed us to uncover new cargo for known cargo receptors and to obtain an unbiased look at specificity in cargo selection. Obtaining the spectrum of cargo for a cargo receptor allows a novel perspective on its mode of action. The rules that appear to guide Erv14 substrate recognition suggest that sorting of membrane proteins at multiple points in the secretory pathway could depend on the physical properties of TMDs. Such a mechanism would allow diverse proteins to utilize a few receptors without the constraints of evolving location-specific sorting motifs.
","All cells sense their environment, respond to it, and communicate with neighboring cells. To perform these functions, cells use an impressive array of proteins that they display on their surface membranes and secrete into their external environment. Newly synthesized proteins destined for the surface of nucleated cells, or to be secreted into the environment must enter the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum. Those that reside there remain behind, but most leave for their next destination as cargo proteins in lipid vesicles. To be packaged into vesicles, many of them require a “cargo receptor,” which recognizes and tethers specific cargo proteins in the vesicles. Our study takes a systematic approach to identify the range of cargo proteins that bind to each of the known receptors in yeast. By using this approach, we both discover new cargo for known cargo receptors and delineate the rule that governs cargo selection for one cargo receptor, Erv14. Thus, our study demonstrates a novel approach to identify the cargo for any receptor or to discover new cargo receptors.

"Chagas disease is the most important vector-borne disease in Latin America. Regional initiatives based on residual insecticide spraying have successfully controlled domiciliated vectors in many regions. Non-domiciliated vectors remain responsible for a significant transmission risk, and their control is now a key challenge for disease control.
A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses. Demographic parameters were estimated by fitting the model to two years of field data from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. The predictive value of the model was tested on an independent data set before simulations examined the efficacy of control strategies based on residual insecticide spraying, insect screens, and bednets. The model accurately fitted and predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was found effective when 50 mg/m2 were applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season. The >80% reduction in bug abundance was not improved by larger doses or more frequent interventions, and it decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. Alternatively, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate.
Control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying, because it would require yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
","Chagas disease is the most important vector-borne disease in Latin America. Residual insecticide spraying has been used successfully for the elimination of domestic vectors in many regions. However, some vectors of non-domestic origin are able to invade houses, and they are now a key challenge for further disease control. We developed a mathematical model to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses, based on triatomine demographic parameters. The reliability of the predictions was demonstrated by comparing these with different sets of insect collection data from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We then simulated vector control strategies based on insecticide spraying, insect, screens and bednets to evaluate their efficacy at reducing triatomine abundance in the houses. An optimum reduction in bug abundance by at least 80% could be obtained by insecticide application only when doses of at least 50 mg/m2 were applied every year within a two-month period matching the house invasion season by bugs. Alternatively, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance in the houses and offers a sustainable alternative. Such screens may be part of novel interventions for the integrated control of various vector-borne diseases.

"Leptospirosis is one of the most important neglected tropical bacterial diseases in Latin America and the Caribbean. However, very little is known about the circulating etiological agents of leptospirosis in this region. In this study, we describe the serological and molecular features of leptospires isolated from 104 leptospirosis patients in Guadeloupe (n = 85) and Martinique (n = 19) and six rats captured in Guadeloupe, between 2004 and 2012.
Strains were studied by serogrouping, PFGE, MLVA, and sequencing 16SrRNA and secY. DNA extracts from blood samples collected from 36 patients in Martinique were also used for molecular typing of leptospires via PCR. Phylogenetic analyses revealed thirteen different genotypes clustered into five main clades that corresponded to the species: L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, L. borgpetersenii, L. noguchi, and L. santarosai. We also identified L. kmetyi in at least two patients with acute leptospirosis. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that this species has been identified in humans. The most prevalent genotypes were associated with L. interrogans serovars Icterohaemorrhagiae and Copenhageni, L. kirschneri serovar Bogvere, and L. borgpetersenii serovar Arborea. We were unable to identify nine strains at the serovar level and comparison of genotyping results to the MLST database revealed new secY alleles.
The overall serovar distribution in the French West Indies was unique compared to the neighboring islands. Typing of leptospiral isolates also suggested the existence of previously undescribed serovars.
","Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by infection with pathogenic strains of Leptospira. Isolation of Leptospira strains is rare, making it difficult to assess their distribution worldwide. In this study, we characterized cultures of Leptospira obtained from more than one hundred leptospirosis patients from the French West Indies by serology and various molecular typing methods to identify the strains circulating in this endemic region. Typing of leptospiral isolates showed that causative agents of leptospirosis in the French West Indies are mainly from the serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae and Ballum, but we also identified new genotypes. We also found that the distribution of the predominant pathogenic leptospiral serovars differed between the Caribbean islands. A better understanding of the epidemiology of leptospirosis will improve our knowledge in the distribution of this emerging neglected tropical disease worldwide. The identification of the circulating etiological agents of leptospirosis in the French West Indies will also help establish appropriate control and prevention measures in this area where the disease is endemic.

"APOBEC3 (A3) family proteins are DNA cytosine deaminases recognized for contributing to HIV-1 restriction and mutation. Prior studies have demonstrated that A3D, A3F, and A3G enzymes elicit a robust anti-HIV-1 effect in cell cultures and in humanized mouse models. Human A3H is polymorphic and can be categorized into three phenotypes: stable, intermediate, and unstable. However, the anti-viral effect of endogenous A3H in vivo has yet to be examined. Here we utilize a hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model and demonstrate that stable A3H robustly affects HIV-1 fitness in vivo. In contrast, the selection pressure mediated by intermediate A3H is relaxed. Intriguingly, viral genomic RNA sequencing reveled that HIV-1 frequently adapts to better counteract stable A3H during replication in humanized mice. Molecular phylogenetic analyses and mathematical modeling suggest that stable A3H may be a critical factor in human-to-human viral transmission. Taken together, this study provides evidence that stable variants of A3H impose selective pressure on HIV-1.
","Human APOBEC3 family proteins are known as intrinsic defenses against HIV-1, whereas HIV-1 Vif counteracts APOBEC3-mediated anti-viral action. Using a hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model, we demonstrated that endogenous APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G play pivotal roles in restricting HIV-1 replication in vivo. In addition to these three APOBEC3 family proteins, certain haplotypes of APOBEC3H have the ability to control HIV-1 replication in cell culture studies. However, the anti-viral effect of APOBEC3H polymorphism in vivo and in human population is yet to be addressed. Here we use a humanized mouse model to show that acquiring resistance to anti-viral APOBEC3H is necessary for HIV-1 replication. Together with phylogenetic analyses and mathematical modeling, we conclude that APOBEC3H is a critical determinant of HIV-1 replication within infected individuals and we propose that it may also be a factor in human-to-human HIV-1 transmission.

"Aedes aegypti, is the major dengue vector and a worldwide public health threat combated basically by chemical insecticides. In this study, the vectorial competence of Ae. aegypti co-infected with a mildly virulent Metarhizium anisopliae and fed with blood infected with the DENV-2 virus, was examined.
The study encompassed three bioassays (B). In B1 the median lethal time (LT50) of Ae. aegypti exposed to M. anisopliae was determined in four treatments: co-infected (CI), single-fungus infection (SF), single-virus infection (SV) and control (C). In B2, the mortality and viral infection rate in midgut and in head were registered in fifty females of CI and in SV. In B3, the same treatments as in B1 but with females separated individually were tested to evaluate the effect on fecundity and gonotrophic cycle length. Survival in CI and SF females was 70% shorter than the one of those in SV and control. Overall viral infection rate in CI and SV were 76 and 84% but the mortality at day six post-infection was 78% (54% infected) and 6% respectively. Survivors with virus in head at day seven post-infection were 12 and 64% in both CI and SV mosquitoes. Fecundity and gonotrophic cycle length were reduced in 52 and 40% in CI compared to the ones in control.
Fungus-induced mortality for the CI group was 78%. Of the survivors, 12% (6/50) could potentially transmit DENV-2, as opposed to 64% (32/50) of the SV group, meaning a 5-fold reduction in the number of infective mosquitoes. This is the first report on a fungus that reduces the vectorial capacity of Ae. aegypti infected with the DENV-2 virus.
","Dengue is a worldwide public health problem. There is not an effective vaccine yet; the chemical struggle against its transmitter, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is onerous and erratic, and the community participation to eliminate vector breeding sites is unconfident. Here, we examined mosquitoes fed on human blood mixed with the Dengue virus, by exposure to the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, to test whether the fungus halts the viral dissemination from midgut to head in co-infected (CI) insects. We found an overall viral infection rate in CI mosquitoes of 76% but infected or not, most (78%) died before or at day six post-infection; only six (12%) out of 50, survivors had virus in head and were potentially infectious at day seven post-infection. A higher infection (84%) was observed in single-virus infected mosquitoes, but they suffered only 6% mortality after 6 days and 32 (64%) survivors tested positive for virus in head after 7 days. Survival, fecundity and ovaric cycle of CI mosquitoes were reduced in 70, 52 and 40% in comparison to the ones of control. Therefore, if the fungus caused a 5-fold reduction in the number of infectious mosquitoes, it has potential to be evaluated against the Dengue transmitter in field.

"Over the past ten years the incidence of pertussis in the United States (U.S.) has risen steadily, with 2012 seeing the highest case number since 1955. There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7–11 year olds. We use epidemiological modelling and a large case incidence dataset to explain the upsurge. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of dynamic epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990–2009, as well as incidence data from a variety of sources from 1950–1989. We find that: the best-fitting model is one in which vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell (wP) vaccine, (efficacy of the first three doses 80% [95% CI: 78%, 82%] versus 90% [95% CI: 87%, 94%]), increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge and 3) 2010–2012 disease incidence is predicted well. In this study, we use all available U.S. surveillance data to: 1) fit a set of mathematical models and determine which best explains these data and 2) determine the epidemiological and vaccine-related parameter values of this model. We find evidence of a difference in efficacy and duration of protection between the two vaccine types, wP and aP (aP efficacy and duration lower than wP). Future refinement of the model presented here will allow for an exploration of alternative vaccination strategies such as different age-spacings, further booster doses, and cocooning.

"E-values have been the dominant statistic for protein sequence analysis for the past two decades: from identifying statistically significant local sequence alignments to evaluating matches to hidden Markov models describing protein domain families. Here we formally show that for “stratified” multiple hypothesis testing problems—that is, those in which statistical tests can be partitioned naturally—controlling the local False Discovery Rate (lFDR) per stratum, or partition, yields the most predictions across the data at any given threshold on the FDR or E-value over all strata combined. For the important problem of protein domain prediction, a key step in characterizing protein structure, function and evolution, we show that stratifying statistical tests by domain family yields excellent results. We develop the first FDR-estimating algorithms for domain prediction, and evaluate how well thresholds based on q-values, E-values and lFDRs perform in domain prediction using five complementary approaches for estimating empirical FDRs in this context. We show that stratified q-value thresholds substantially outperform E-values. Contradicting our theoretical results, q-values also outperform lFDRs; however, our tests reveal a small but coherent subset of domain families, biased towards models for specific repetitive patterns, for which weaknesses in random sequence models yield notably inaccurate statistical significance measures. Usage of lFDR thresholds outperform q-values for the remaining families, which have as-expected noise, suggesting that further improvements in domain predictions can be achieved with improved modeling of random sequences. Overall, our theoretical and empirical findings suggest that the use of stratified q-values and lFDRs could result in improvements in a host of structured multiple hypothesis testing problems arising in bioinformatics, including genome-wide association studies, orthology prediction, and motif scanning.
","Despite decades of research, it remains a challenge to distinguish homologous relationships between proteins from sequence similarities arising due to chance alone. This is an increasingly important problem as sequence database sizes continue to grow, and even today many computational analyses require that the statistics of billions of sequence comparisons be assessed automatically. Here we explore statistical significance evaluation on data that is stratified—that is, naturally partitioned into subsets that may differ in their amount of signal—and find a theoretically optimal criterion for automatically setting thresholds of significance for each stratum. For the task of domain prediction, an important component of efforts to annotate protein sequences and identify remote sequence homologs, we empirically show that our stratified analysis of statistical significance greatly improves upon a combined analysis. Further, we identify weaknesses in the prevailing random sequence model for assessing statistical significance for a small subset of domain families with repetitive sequence patterns and known biological, structural, and evolutionary properties. Our theoretical findings in statistics are relevant not only for identifying protein domains, but for arbitrary stratified problems in genomics and beyond.

"A type III secretion system (T3SS) in pathogenic Yersinia
                    species functions to translocate Yop effectors, which modulate cytokine
                    production and regulate cell death in macrophages. Distinct pathways of
                    T3SS-dependent cell death and caspase-1 activation occur in
                        Yersinia-infected macrophages. One pathway of cell death
                    and caspase-1 activation in macrophages requires the effector YopJ. YopJ is an
                    acetyltransferase that inactivates MAPK kinases and IKKβ to cause
                    TLR4-dependent apoptosis in naïve macrophages. A YopJ isoform in Y.
                        pestis KIM (YopJKIM) has two amino acid substitutions,
                    F177L and K206E, not present in YopJ proteins of Y.
                        pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis CO92. As compared
                    to other YopJ isoforms, YopJKIM causes increased apoptosis, caspase-1
                    activation, and secretion of IL-1β in Yersinia-infected
                    macrophages. The molecular basis for increased apoptosis and activation of
                    caspase-1 by YopJKIM in Yersinia-infected
                    macrophages was studied. Site directed mutagenesis showed that the F177L and
                    K206E substitutions in YopJKIM were important for enhanced apoptosis,
                    caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β secretion. As compared to
                        YopJCO92, YopJKIM displayed an enhanced capacity to
                    inhibit phosphorylation of IκB-α in macrophages and to bind IKKβ in
                    vitro. YopJKIM also showed a moderately increased ability to inhibit
                    phosphorylation of MAPKs. Increased caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1β secretion
                    occurred in IKKβ-deficient macrophages infected with Y.
                        pestis expressing YopJCO92, confirming that the
                    NF-κB pathway can negatively regulate inflammasome activation.
                        K+ efflux, NLRP3 and ASC were important for secretion of
                    IL-1β in response to Y. pestis KIM infection as shown using
                    macrophages lacking inflammasome components or by the addition of exogenous KCl.
                    These data show that caspase-1 is activated in naïve macrophages in
                    response to infection with a pathogen that inhibits IKKβ and MAPK kinases
                    and induces TLR4-dependent apoptosis. This pro-inflammatory form of apoptosis
                    may represent an early innate immune response to highly virulent pathogens such
                    as Y. pestis KIM that have evolved an enhanced ability to
                    inhibit host signaling pathways.
","Pathogenic bacteria in the genus Yersinia use multiple virulence
                    determinants to counteract innate immunity and facilitate infection. A type III
                    system in Yersinia translocates an effector called YopJ that
                    elicits cell death in macrophages. YopJ inhibits the production of survival
                    factors in naïve macrophages, causing them to die by apoptosis, which is
                    generally considered to be immunologically silent. However, recent studies show
                    that caspase-1, a key regulator of pro-inflammatory responses, is activated in
                        Yersinia-infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis. How
                    caspase-1 is activated during YopJ-induced macrophage apoptosis is not known. We
                    have identified a distinct isoform of YopJ in Y. pestis
                        (YopJKIM) that induces high levels of apoptosis and caspase-1
                    activation in infected macrophages. In this study, the molecular basis for the
                    increased activity of YopJKIM was studied with the goal of better
                    understanding the underlying mechanism of caspase-1 activation. The data show
                    that YopJKIM has two amino acid changes that give it an enhanced
                    ability to inhibit survival signals in macrophages. The increased apoptosis may
                    cause membrane permeability, resulting in efflux of ions and activation of
                    caspase-1. Therefore, apoptosis of naïve macrophages inflicted by highly
                    virulent pathogens may not be immunologically silent.

"Lipids are main fuels for cellular energy and mitochondria their major oxidation site. Yet unknown is to what extent the fuel role of lipids is influenced by their uncoupling effects, and how this affects mitochondrial energetics, redox balance and the emission of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Employing a combined experimental-computational approach, we comparatively analyze β-oxidation of palmitoyl CoA (PCoA) in isolated heart mitochondria from Sham and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic (T1DM) guinea pigs (GPs). Parallel high throughput measurements of the rates of oxygen consumption (VO2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emission as a function of PCoA concentration, in the presence of L-carnitine and malate, were performed. We found that PCoA concentration < 200 nmol/mg mito protein resulted in low H2O2 emission flux, increasing thereafter in Sham and T1DM GPs under both states 4 and 3 respiration with diabetic mitochondria releasing higher amounts of ROS. Respiratory uncoupling and ROS excess occurred at PCoA > 600 nmol/mg mito prot, in both control and diabetic animals. Also, for the first time, we show that an integrated two compartment mitochondrial model of β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and main energy-redox processes is able to simulate the relationship between VO2 and H2O2 emission as a function of lipid concentration. Model and experimental results indicate that PCoA oxidation and its concentration-dependent uncoupling effect, together with a partial lipid-dependent decrease in the rate of superoxide generation, modulate H2O2 emission as a function of VO2. Results indicate that keeping low levels of intracellular lipid is crucial for mitochondria and cells to maintain ROS within physiological levels compatible with signaling and reliable energy supply.
","Lipids are main sources of energy for liver and cardiac and skeletal muscle. Mitochondria are the main site of lipid oxidation which, in the heart, supplies most of the energy required for its blood pumping function. Paradoxically, however, lipids over supply impair mitochondrial function leading to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and diabetes. In this context, scientific debate centers on the impact of lipids and mitochondrial function on diverse aspects of human health, nutrition and disease. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this issue, while accounting for both the fundamental role of lipids as energy source as well as their potential detrimental effects, we utilized a combined experimental and computational approach. Our mitochondrial computational model includes β-oxidation, the main route of lipid degradation, among other pathways that include oxygen radical generation and consumption. Studies were performed in heart mitochondria from type 1 diabetic and control guinea pigs. Model and experimental results show that, below a concentration threshold, lipids fueling proceeds without disrupting mitochondrial function; above threshold, lipids uncouple mitochondrial respiration triggering excess emission of oxidants while impairing antioxidant systems and the mitochondrial energy supply-demand response. These contributions are of direct use for interpreting and predicting functional impairments in metabolic disorders associated with increased circulating levels of lipids and metabolic alterations in their utilization, storage and intracellular signaling.

"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), particularly the USA300 strain, is a highly virulent pathogen responsible for an increasing number of skin and soft tissue infections globally. Furthermore, MRSA-induced soft tissue infections can rapidly progress into life-threatening conditions, such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. The importance of neutrophils in these devastating soft tissue infections remains ambiguous, partly because of our incomplete understanding of their behaviour. Spinning disk confocal microscopy was used to visualize the behaviour of GR1-labelled neutrophils in subcutaneous tissue in response to GFP-expressing MRSA attached to a foreign particle (agarose bead). We observed significant directional neutrophil recruitment towards the S. aureus agarose bead but not a control agarose bead. A significant increase in neutrophil crawling within the capillaries surrounding the infectious nidus was noted, with impaired capillary perfusion in these vessels and increased parenchymal cell death. No neutrophils were able to emigrate from capillaries. The crawling within these capillaries was mediated by the β2 and α4 integrins and blocking these integrins 2 hours post infection eliminated neutrophil crawling, improved capillary perfusion, reduced cell death and reduced lesion size. Blocking prior to infection increased pathology. Neutrophil crawling within capillaries during MRSA soft tissue infections, while potentially contributing to walling off or preventing early dissemination of the pathogen, resulted in impaired perfusion and increased tissue injury with time.
","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a highly virulent pathogen responsible for a significant portion of skin and soft tissue infections throughout the world. We investigated the role of neutrophils in soft tissue infections, as these immune cells have been shown to be both essential for clearance of this pathogen but also for increasing tissue injury associated with S. aureus infections. We visualized the behaviour of neutrophils in the subcutaneous tissue following the introduction of a localized infectious stimulus. In addition to a profound neutrophil recruitment into the infectious nidus, significant neutrophil crawling in capillaries surrounding the region was also noted, a region of vasculature which has not previously been associated with neutrophil recruitment during infection. The neutrophils were not seen to emigrate from the capillaries but rather were retained in these vessels and maintained a crawling behaviour via β2 and α4 integrins. Blocking these integrins released the neutrophils from the capillaries, reinstituted capillary perfusion, and reduced the surrounding cell death leading to reduced lesion size following infection. Neutrophil crawling within capillaries during MRSA soft tissue infections, while potentially contributing to walling off or preventing dissemination of the pathogen, resulted in impaired perfusion and increased tissue injury.

"Onchocerca volvulus infection can result in blindness, itching and skin lesions. Previous research concentrated on blindness.
A clinical classification system of the cutaneous changes in onchocerciasis was used for the first time in this study within the context of an early ivermectin drug trial in the savanna region of Kaduna State, northern Nigeria. Skin examinations were performed in 6,790 individuals aged 5+ years in endemic communities and 1,343 individuals in nonendemic communities.
There was increased risk for all forms of onchocercal skin disease in endemic communities with the most common finding being the presence of nodules (1,438 individuals, 21.2%), followed by atrophy (367, 6.1% of those < 50 years), acute papular onchodermatitis, APOD (233, 3.4%), depigmentation (216, 3.2%) and chronic papular onchodermatitis, CPOD (155, 2.3%). A further 645 individuals (9.5%) complained of pruritus but had completely normal skin. APOD was more common in males whereas atrophy, hanging groin and nodules were more common in females. After controlling for age and sex, microfilarial positivity was a risk factor for CPOD, depigmentation, hanging groin and nodules (OR 1.54, p = 0.046; OR 2.29, p = 0.002; OR 2.18, p = 0.002 and OR 3.80, p <0.001 respectively). Comparable results were found using presence of nodules as the marker for infection. Microfilarial load showed similar, though weaker, results. A total of 2621(38.6%) endemic residents had itching with normal skin, or had one or more types of onchocercal skin disease including nodules, which may be considered as a composite index of the overall prevalence of onchocercal skin disease.
Significant levels of onchocercal skin disease were documented in this savanna area, which subsequently resulted in a reassessment of the true burden of skin disease in onchocerciasis. This paper represents the first detailed report of the association of onchocercal skin disease with markers for onchocercal infection.
","Onchocerciasis is a tropical parasitic infection caused by the nematode worm Onchocerca volvulus. The disease mainly occurs across tropical Africa and infection can result in blindness, debilitating itching and a variety of skin changes. Initial research concentrated mainly on the problem of blindness. A number of studies on onchocercal skin disease were performed but were difficult to interpret and compare because of the use of inconsistent terminology. Within the setting of one of the early trials of ivermectin in a savanna area of northern Nigeria, where there were known high rates of onchocercal blindness, we used a novel clinical classification of the skin changes in onchocerciasis. We identified significant levels of itching and various forms of onchocercal skin disease within these endemic communities. A positive skin-snip result proved to be a significant risk factor for the presence of chronic papular onchodermatitis (CPOD), depigmentation, hanging groin and onchocercal nodules. Comparable results were found when the presence of nodules was used as the marker for infection and similar, though weaker odds ratios were found with microfilarial load per se. The findings triggered a reassessment of the true burden of skin disease in onchocerciasis. It is the first detailed report of the association between onchocercal skin disease and markers of infection.

"Glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) influences IgG effector function by modulating binding to Fc receptors. To identify genetic loci associated with IgG glycosylation, we quantitated N-linked IgG glycans using two approaches. After isolating IgG from human plasma, we performed 77 quantitative measurements of N-glycosylation using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) in 2,247 individuals from four European discovery populations. In parallel, we measured IgG N-glycans using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) in a replication cohort of 1,848 Europeans. Meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results identified 9 genome-wide significant loci (P<2.27×10−9) in the discovery analysis and two of the same loci (B4GALT1 and MGAT3) in the replication cohort. Four loci contained genes encoding glycosyltransferases (ST6GAL1, B4GALT1, FUT8, and MGAT3), while the remaining 5 contained genes that have not been previously implicated in protein glycosylation (IKZF1, IL6ST-ANKRD55, ABCF2-SMARCD3, SUV420H1, and SMARCB1-DERL3). However, most of them have been strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes type 1, multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, celiac disease, nodular sclerosis) and/or haematological cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). Follow-up functional experiments in haplodeficient Ikzf1 knock-out mice showed the same general pattern of changes in IgG glycosylation as identified in the meta-analysis. As IKZF1 was associated with multiple IgG N-glycan traits, we explored biomarker potential of affected N-glycans in 101 cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated substantial discriminative power in a ROC-curve analysis (area under the curve = 0.842). Our study shows that it is possible to identify new loci that control glycosylation of a single plasma protein using GWAS. The results may also provide an explanation for the reported pleiotropy and antagonistic effects of loci involved in autoimmune diseases and haematological cancer.
","After analysing glycans attached to human immunoglobulin G in 4,095 individuals, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the glycome of an individual protein. Nine genetic loci were found to associate with glycans with genome-wide significance. Of these, four were enzymes that directly participate in IgG glycosylation, thus the observed associations were biologically founded. The remaining five genetic loci were not previously implicated in protein glycosylation, but the most of them have been reported to be relevant for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions and/or haematological cancers. A particularly interesting gene, IKZF1 was found to be associated with multiple IgG N-glycans. This gene has been implicated in numerous diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We analysed N-glycans in 101 cases with SLE and 183 matched controls and demonstrated their substantial biomarker potential. Our study shows that it is possible to identify new loci that control glycosylation of a single plasma protein using GWAS. Our results may also provide an explanation for opposite effects of some genes in autoimmune diseases and haematological cancer.

"In the United States, the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) largely eliminated vaccine serotypes (VT); non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) subsequently increased in carriage and disease. Vaccination also disrupts the composition of the pneumococcal pangenome, which includes mobile genetic elements and polymorphic non-capsular antigens important for virulence, transmission, and pneumococcal ecology. Antigenic proteins are of interest for future vaccines; yet, little is known about how the they are affected by PCV use. To investigate the evolutionary impact of vaccination, we assessed recombination, evolution, and pathogen demographic history of 937 pneumococci collected from 1998–2012 among Navajo and White Mountain Apache Native American communities. We analyzed changes in the pneumococcal pangenome, focusing on metabolic loci and 19 polymorphic protein antigens. We found the impact of PCV on the pneumococcal population could be observed in reduced diversity, a smaller pangenome, and changing frequencies of accessory clusters of orthologous groups (COGs). Post-PCV7, diversity rebounded through clonal expansion of NVT lineages and inferred in-migration of two previously unobserved lineages. Accessory COGs frequencies trended toward pre-PCV7 values with increasing time since vaccine introduction. Contemporary frequencies of protein antigen variants are better predicted by pre-PCV7 values (1998–2000) than the preceding period (2006–2008), suggesting balancing selection may have acted in maintaining variant frequencies in this population. Overall, we present the largest genomic analysis of pneumococcal carriage in the United States to date, which includes a snapshot of a true vaccine-naïve community prior to the introduction of PCV7. These data improve our understanding of pneumococcal evolution and emphasize the need to consider pangenome composition when inferring the impact of vaccination and developing future protein-based pneumococcal vaccines.
","Pneumococcal disease caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite the existence of an effective vaccine. This is because the vaccines only target a small proportion of the total pneumococcal population. Introduction of vaccine in the United States removed vaccine serotypes leaving an open niche that was rapidly filled by non-vaccine serotypes. Forecasting which serotypes, and more generally which pneumococcal lineages, will increase in frequency in carriage and disease is an active area of research with significant public health importance. Here, we investigate the evolutionary impact of vaccination on the pneumococcal population using genomic data from a collection of 937 pneumococcal isolates collected from 1998–2012 among Native American communities. We find the impact of vaccine on the pneumococcal population could be observed in reduced diversity and changing frequencies of genes. Diversity subsequently rebounded through expansion and in-migration of non-vaccine lineages. Further, frequencies of genes coding for protein antigens important to host-pathogen interaction were initially disrupted but later returned to pre-vaccine values, suggesting selection may have acted in maintaining frequencies. These data improve our understanding of pneumococcal evolution and emphasize the need to consider genome composition when inferring the impact of vaccination.

"Bacterial chromosomes are organized into polycistronic cotranscribed operons, but the evolutionary pressures maintaining them are unclear. We hypothesized that operons alter gene expression noise characteristics, resulting in selection for or against maintaining operons depending on network architecture. Mathematical models for 6 functional classes of network modules showed that three classes exhibited decreased noise and 3 exhibited increased noise with same-operon cotranscription of interacting proteins. Noise reduction was often associated with a decreased chance of reaching an ultrasensitive threshold. Stochastic simulations of the lac operon demonstrated that the predicted effects of transcriptional coupling hold for a complex network module. We employed bioinformatic analysis to find overrepresentation of noise-minimizing operon organization compared with randomized controls. Among constitutively expressed physically interacting protein pairs, higher coupling frequencies appeared at lower expression levels, where noise effects are expected to be dominant. Our results thereby suggest an important role for gene expression noise, in many cases interacting with an ultrasensitive switch, in maintaining or selecting for operons in bacterial chromosomes.
","In some species, most notably bacteria, chromosomal genes are arranged into clusters called operons. In operons, the process of transcription is physically coupled: a single pass of the RNA polymerase enzyme reading that region of the chromosome simultaneously produces messenger RNA encoding multiple proteins. So far, we do not have a satisfying explanation for what evolutionary forces have maintained operons on bacterial chromosomes. We hypothesized that different types of interactions between operon-coded proteins affect how strongly operons are selected for between two genes. The proposed mechanism for this effect is that operons correlate gene expression noise, changing how it manifests in the post-translational network depending on the type of protein interaction. Mathematical models demonstrate that operons reduce noise for some types of interactions but not others. We found that operon-dependent noise reduction has an underlying dependence on surprisingly high sensitivity of the network to the ratio of proteins from each gene. Databases of genetic information show that E. coli has operons more frequently than random if operons reduce noise for the type of interaction various gene pairs have, but not otherwise. Our study thus provides an example of how the architecture of post-translational networks affects bacterial evolution.

"The mechanisms that ensure fertilization of egg by a sperm are not fully understood. In all teleosts, a channel called the ‘micropyle’ is the only route of entry for sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. The micropyle forms by penetration of the vitelline envelope by a single specialized follicle cell, the micropylar cell. The mechanisms underlying micropylar cell specification and micropyle formation are poorly understood. Here, we show that an effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, the Transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding domain (Taz), plays crucial roles in micropyle formation and fertilization in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Genome editing mutants affecting taz can grow to adults. However, eggs from homozygous taz females are not fertilized even though oocytes in mutant females are histologically normal with intact animal-vegetal polarity, complete meiosis and proper ovulation. We find that taz mutant eggs have no micropyle. Taz protein is specifically enriched in mid-oogenesis in the micropylar cell located at the animal pole of wild type oocyte, where it might regulate the cytoskeleton. Taz protein and micropylar cells are not detected in taz mutant ovaries. Our work identifies a novel role for the Hippo/Taz pathway in micropylar cell specification in zebrafish, and uncovers the molecular basis of micropyle formation in teleosts.
","In many fish, sperm enters eggs through a specialized channel called the ‘micropyle’. The micropyle is formed by a special follicle cell, the ‘micropylar cell’, which sits on the top of the developing egg during oogenesis, and forms the sperm entry canal. The underlying mechanisms of this process are unknown. We find that Taz, an effector of an important signaling pathway, the Hippo pathway, is specifically enriched in micropylar cells in zebrafish, and regulates formation of the micropyle. Loss of Taz function in females results in no micropylar cells, failure to form a micropyle on eggs, which are consequently, not fertilized. Our study identifies a new role for the Hippo/Taz pathway in cell fate specification in the ovary, and reveals a potential mechanism for forming the sperm entry port. Similar mechanisms might operate in other fish as well.

"Cell division, endocytosis, and viral budding would not function without the localization and assembly of protein complexes on membranes. What is poorly appreciated, however, is that by localizing to membranes, proteins search in a reduced space that effectively drives up concentration. Here we derive an accurate and practical analytical theory to quantify the significance of this dimensionality reduction in regulating protein assembly on membranes. We define a simple metric, an effective equilibrium constant, that allows for quantitative comparison of protein-protein interactions with and without membrane present. To test the importance of membrane localization for driving protein assembly, we collected the protein-protein and protein-lipid affinities, protein and lipid concentrations, and volume-to-surface-area ratios for 46 interactions between 37 membrane-targeting proteins in human and yeast cells. We find that many of the protein-protein interactions between pairs of proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human and yeast cells can experience enormous increases in effective protein-protein affinity (10–1000 fold) due to membrane localization. Localization of binding partners thus triggers robust protein complexation, suggesting that it can play an important role in controlling the timing of endocytic protein coat formation. Our analysis shows that several other proteins involved in membrane remodeling at various organelles have similar potential to exploit localization. The theory highlights the master role of phosphoinositide lipid concentration, the volume-to-surface-area ratio, and the ratio of 3D to 2D equilibrium constants in triggering (or preventing) constitutive assembly on membranes. Our simple model provides a novel quantitative framework for interpreting or designing in vitro experiments of protein complexation influenced by membrane binding.
","In a multitude of cellular processes, including cell division and endocytosis, proteins must bind to one another to form large multi-protein complexes. To initiate the formation of these critical multi-protein assemblies at the right time and the right place, the constituent proteins must be present at sufficient concentrations. We show here that membrane localization offers a powerful way of controlling protein concentrations by reducing the dimensionality of the protein’s search space. We present a simple and practical analytical theory that determines the significance of membrane localization for triggering protein-protein interactions. We show that protein binding partners will often form substantially more complexes when both partners can localize to surfaces, and thus localization can regulate the timing of multi-protein assembly. We collect in vitro binding data and cellular concentrations of proteins and lipids involved in pathways including clathrin-mediated endocytosis to demonstrate how cellular proteins could exploit membrane localization to regulate assembly.

"It has been suggested that imprinted genes are important in the regulation of sleep. However, the fundamental question of whether genomic imprinting has a role in sleep has remained elusive up to now. In this work we show that REM and NREM sleep states are differentially modulated by the maternally expressed imprinted gene Gnas. In particular, in mice with loss of imprinting of Gnas, NREM and complex cognitive processes are enhanced while REM and REM–linked behaviors are inhibited. This is the first demonstration that a specific overexpression of an imprinted gene affects sleep states and related complex behavioral traits. Furthermore, in parallel to the Gnas overexpression, we have observed an overexpression of Ucp1 in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and a significant increase in thermoregulation that may account for the REM/NREM sleep phenotypes. We conclude that there must be significant evolutionary advantages in the monoallelic expression of Gnas for REM sleep and for the consolidation of REM–dependent memories. Conversely, biallelic expression of Gnas reinforces slow wave activity in NREM sleep, and this results in a reduction of uncertainty in temporal decision-making processes.
","REM and NREM sleep are two distinct stages of the sleeping brain that are involved in the modulation of metabolic, physiological, and cognitive processes. Clinical evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, such as genomic imprinting, play a role in sleep. Here we show that REM and NREM brain states are differentially modulated by the maternally imprinted gene Gnas. In particular, a mutation resulting in loss of imprinted expression of Gnas enhances NREM–dependent physiologic and cognitive functions while repressing REM and REM-linked functions. This is the first experimental demonstration of a specific effect of genomic imprinting on sleep states and their associated effects on cognition.

"Research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has increased in recent decades, and significant need-gaps in diagnostic and treatment tools remain. Analysing bibliometric data from published research is a powerful method for revealing research efforts, partnerships and expertise. We aim to identify and map NTD research networks in Germany and their partners abroad to enable an informed and transparent evaluation of German contributions to NTD research.
A SCOPUS database search for articles with German author affiliations that were published between 2002 and 2012 was conducted for kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. Open-access tools were used for data cleaning and scientometrics (OpenRefine), geocoding (OpenStreetMaps) and to create (Table2Net), visualise and analyse co-authorship networks (Gephi). From 26,833 publications from around the world that addressed 11 diseases, we identified 1,187 (4.4%) with at least one German author affiliation, and we processed 972 publications for the five most published-about diseases. Of those, we extracted 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil. Collaborations with partners on the African continent remain scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions. We identified strong performers on an individual level by using classic parameters (number of publications, h-index) and social network analysis parameters (betweenness centrality). The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases.
The share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research. This finding underlines the need to identify barriers and expand Germany’s otherwise strong research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which were less involved in collaborations than high-income countries. Identifying knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks complements traditional scientometric indicators that are used to identify opportunities for collaboration. Using free tools to analyse research processes and output could facilitate data-driven health policies. Our findings contribute to the prioritisation of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.
","Neglected tropical disease research has changed considerably in recent decades, and the German government is committed to addressing its past neglect of NTD research. Our aim was to use an innovative social network analysis of bibliometric data to map neglected tropical disease research networks that are inside of and affiliated with Germany, thereby enabling data-driven health policy decision-making. We created and analysed co-author networks from publications in the SCOPUS database, with a focus on five diseases. We found that Germany's share of global publication output for NTDs is approximately half that of other medical research fields. Furthermore, we identified institutions with prominent NTD research within Germany and strong research collaborations between German institutions and partners abroad, mostly in other high-income countries. This allowed an assessment of strong collaborations for further development, e.g., for research capacity strengthening in low-income-countries, but also for identifying missed opportunities for collaboration within the network. Through co-authorship network analysis of individual researcher networks, we identified strong performers by using classic bibliometric parameters, and we identified academic talent by social network analysis parameters on an individual level.

"Lymphadenopathy is a hallmark of acute infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, a tick-borne spirochete and causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, but the underlying causes and the functional consequences of this lymph node enlargement have not been revealed. The present study demonstrates that extracellular, live spirochetes accumulate in the cortical areas of lymph nodes following infection of mice with either host-adapted, or tick-borne B. burgdorferi and that they, but not inactivated spirochetes, drive the lymphadenopathy. The ensuing lymph node response is characterized by strong, rapid extrafollicular B cell proliferation and differentiation to plasma cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and ELISPOT analysis, while germinal center reactions were not consistently observed. The extrafollicular nature of this B cell response and its strongly IgM-skewed isotype profile bear the hallmarks of a T-independent response. The induced B cell response does appear, however, to be largely antigen-specific. Use of a cocktail of recombinant, in vivo-expressed B. burgdorferi-antigens revealed the robust induction of borrelia-specific antibody-secreting cells by ELISPOT. Furthermore, nearly a quarter of hybridomas generated from regional lymph nodes during acute infection showed reactivity against a small number of recombinant Borrelia-antigens. Finally, neither the quality nor the magnitude of the B cell responses was altered in mice lacking the Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule MyD88. Together, these findings suggest a novel evasion strategy for B. burgdorferi: subversion of the quality of a strongly induced, potentially protective borrelia-specific antibody response via B. burdorferi's accumulation in lymph nodes.
","Acute Lyme Disease is one of the most important emerging diseases in the US. People with acute Lyme disease often develop swollen lymph nodes, or lymphadenopathy, but we do not know why this happens or what effect it has on the course of the disease. We show here that when mice are infected with live Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes (the bacteria that cause Lyme disease), live spirochetes collect in the lymph nodes. These lymph nodes then swell up and start producing large numbers of antibody-producing cells. Although many of these antibodies can recognize the bacteria, they apparently lack the quality to clear the infection. We hypothesize that by moving into the lymph node, usually a site in which strong immune responses are induced, Borrelia evades the immune response: it goes to the lymph nodes and tricks the immune system into making a very strong but inadequate response.

"Mechanisms that generate transcript diversity are of fundamental importance in eukaryotes. Although a large fraction of human protein-coding genes and lincRNAs produce more than one mRNA isoform each, the regulation of this phenomenon is still incompletely understood. Much progress has been made in deciphering the role of sequence-specific features as well as DNA-and RNA-binding proteins in alternative splicing. Recently, however, several experimental studies of individual genes have revealed a direct involvement of epigenetic factors in alternative splicing and transcription initiation. While histone modifications are generally correlated with overall gene expression levels, it remains unclear how histone modification enrichment affects relative isoform abundance. Therefore, we sought to investigate the associations between histone modifications and transcript diversity levels measured by the rates of transcription start-site switching and alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale across protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. We found that the relationship between enrichment levels of epigenetic marks and transcription start-site switching is similar for protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. Furthermore, we found associations between splicing rates and enrichment levels of H2az, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K79me2, and H4K20me, marks traditionally associated with enhancers, transcription initiation, transcriptional repression, and others. These patterns were observed in both normal and cancer cell lines. Additionally, we developed a novel computational method that identified 840 epigenetically regulated candidate genes and predicted transcription start-site switching and alternative exon splicing with up to 92% accuracy based on epigenetic patterning alone. Our results suggest that the epigenetic regulation of transcript isoform diversity may be a relatively common genome-wide phenomenon representing an avenue of deregulation in tumor development.
","Traditionally, the regulation of gene expression was thought to be largely based on DNA and RNA sequence motifs. However, this dogma has recently been challenged as other factors, such as epigenetic patterning of the genome, have become better understood. Sparse but convincing experimental evidence suggests that the epigenetic background, in the form of histone modifications, acts as an additional layer of regulation determining how transcripts are processed. Here we developed a computational approach to investigate the genome-wide prevalence and the level of association between the enrichment of epigenetic marks and transcript diversity generated via alternative transcription start sites and splicing. We found that the role of epigenetic patterning in alternative transcription start-site switching is likely to be the same for all genes whereas the role of epigenetic patterns in splicing is likely gene-specific. Furthermore, we show that epigenetic data alone can be used to predict the inclusion pattern of an exon. These findings have significant implications for a better understanding of the regulation of transcript diversity in humans as well as the modifications arising during tumor development.

"The retromer mediates protein trafficking through recycling cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network in eukaryotes. However, the role of such trafficking events during pathogen-host interaction remains unclear. Here, we report that the cargo-recognition complex (MoVps35, MoVps26 and MoVps29) of the retromer is essential for appressorium-mediated host penetration by Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal pathogen of the blast disease in rice. Loss of retromer function blocked glycogen distribution and turnover of lipid bodies, delayed nuclear degeneration and reduced turgor during appressorial development. Cytological observation revealed dynamic MoVps35-GFP foci co-localized with autophagy-related protein RFP-MoAtg8 at the periphery of autolysosomes. Furthermore, RFP-MoAtg8 interacted with MoVps35-GFP in vivo, RFP-MoAtg8 was mislocalized to the vacuole and failed to recycle from the autolysosome in the absence of the retromer function, leading to impaired biogenesis of autophagosomes. We therefore conclude that retromer is essential for autophagy-dependent plant infection by the rice blast fungus.
","The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae utilizes key infection structures, called appressoria, elaborated at the tips of the conidial germ tubes to gain entry into the host tissue. Development of the appressorium is accompanied with autophagy in the conidium leading to programmed cell death. This work highlights the significance of the Vps35/retromer membrane-trafficking machinery in the regulation of autophagy during appressorium-mediated host penetration, and thus sheds light on a novel molecular mechanism underlying autophagy-based membrane trafficking events during pathogen-host interaction in rice blast disease. Our findings provide the first genetic evidence that the retromer controls the initiation of autophagy in filamentous fungi.

"During colonisation of the upper respiratory tract, bacteria are exposed to gradients of temperatures. Neisseria meningitidis is often present in the nasopharynx of healthy individuals, yet can occasionally cause severe disseminated disease. The meningococcus can evade the human complement system using a range of strategies that include recruitment of the negative complement regulator, factor H (CFH) via factor H binding protein (fHbp). We have shown previously that fHbp levels are influenced by the ambient temperature, with more fHbp produced at higher temperatures (i.e. at 37°C compared with 30°C). Here we further characterise the mechanisms underlying thermoregulation of fHbp, which occurs gradually over a physiologically relevant range of temperatures. We show that fHbp thermoregulation is not dependent on the promoters governing transcription of the bi- or mono-cistronic fHbp mRNA, or on meningococcal specific transcription factors. Instead, fHbp thermoregulation requires sequences located in the translated region of the mono-cistronic fHbp mRNA. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that two anti-ribosomal binding sequences within the coding region of the fHbp transcript are involved in fHbp thermoregulation. Our results shed further light on mechanisms underlying the control of the production of this important virulence factor and vaccine antigen.
","The bacterium Neisseria meningitidis is exquisitely adapted to survive in the human host, and possesses several mechanisms to interact with host cells in the upper airway and to circumvent immune responses. However, the mechanisms that govern the expression of factors that contribute to colonisation and disease are incompletely understood. In this work, we further characterise how temperature influences the production of factor H binding protein (fHbp) by the meningococcus; fHbp recruits human complement proteins to the surface of the bacterium, and is an important vaccine antigen. We show that thermoregulation of fHbp occurs gradually over a physiological range of temperatures found in the upper airway, the site of colonisation. This regulation does not require specific meningococcal transcription factors, and sequence analysis indicates that fHbp mRNA forms a secondary structure which could act as an RNA thermosensor. Additional studies demonstrate that there are two specific sequences within the coding region of fHbp mRNA are important for thermosensing and could base-pair to the ribosome binding site, thus blocking translation of this protein. As fHbp is thermoregulated, vaccines that target this antigen might not impose a high level of selective pressure on the bacterium at the mucosal surface, thereby limiting herd immunity induce by fHbp containing vaccines.

"The Notch pathway controls proliferation during development and in adulthood, and is frequently affected in many disorders. However, the genetic sensitivity and multi-layered transcriptional properties of the Notch pathway has made its molecular decoding challenging. Here, we address the complexity of Notch signaling with respect to proliferation, using the developing Drosophila CNS as model. We find that a Notch/Su(H)/E(spl)-HLH cascade specifically controls daughter, but not progenitor proliferation. Additionally, we find that different E(spl)-HLH genes are required in different neuroblast lineages. The Notch/Su(H)/E(spl)-HLH cascade alters daughter proliferation by regulating four key cell cycle factors: Cyclin E, String/Cdc25, E2f and Dacapo (mammalian p21CIP1/p27KIP1/p57Kip2). ChIP and DamID analysis of Su(H) and E(spl)-HLH indicates direct transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle genes, and of the Notch pathway itself. These results point to a multi-level signaling model and may help shed light on the dichotomous proliferative role of Notch signaling in many other systems.
","Communication between cells is critical for controlling proliferation, and the Notch signal transduction pathway plays a well-established and evolutionary conserved role during these processes. However, in spite of numerous studies of this pathway over the years, the genetic sensitivity of the pathway, combined with complexity in the nuclear response to Notch activation, has often precluded an in-depth molecular understanding of the pathway. In addition, findings in many systems point to both anti- and pro-proliferative roles of Notch signaling. Here, we use a number of novel genetic strains–mutants and misexpression transgenes–and focus on a particular role of the pathway; daughter cell proliferation in the embryonic Drosophila central nervous system. Combined with genome-wide chromatin binding assays, we are able to decode the pathway and identify both the nuclear effectors downstream Notch, as well the key cell cycle genes involved. We find that Notch activity is gated by a process of direct and indirect transcriptional output, which acts to balance the proliferation decision with high fidelity. These findings shed light on the dichotomous nature of Notch signaling with respect to proliferation control and may point to widely used aspects of the pathway.

"Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is a devastating foliar disease. The Ug99 race group has combined virulence to most stem rust (Sr) resistance genes deployed in wheat and is a threat to global wheat production. Here we identified a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) completely linked to the Ug99 resistance gene Sr21 from Triticum monococcum. Loss-of-function mutations and transgenic complementation confirmed that this gene is Sr21. Sr21 transcripts were significantly higher at high temperatures, and this was associated with significant upregulation of pathogenesis related (PR) genes and increased levels of resistance at those temperatures. Introgression of Sr21 into hexaploid wheat resulted in lower levels of resistance than in diploid wheat, but transgenic hexaploid wheat lines with high levels of Sr21 expression showed high levels of resistance. Sr21 can be a valuable component of transgenic cassettes or gene pyramids combining multiple resistance genes against Ug99.
","Wheat stem rust is a devastating disease that is threatening global wheat production. The emergence of new virulent races of this pathogen in Africa, including the Ug99 race group, has prompted global efforts to find effective resistance genes. We report here the identification of stem rust resistance gene Sr21 that is effective against the Ug99 race group. We developed a diagnostic marker to accelerate its deployment in wheat breeding programs and demonstrated that the introduction of two Sr21 copies in transgenic wheat results in high levels of resistance. An unusual characteristic of Sr21 is its increased resistance to stem rust at high temperatures. We show here that this is associated with the ability of Sr21 to coordinate the upregulation of multiple pathogenesis related genes at high temperatures. These genes slow down the growth of the pathogen and result in the characteristic Sr21 intermediate resistance reaction at high temperatures. A better understanding of this temperature dependent resistance mechanism will be useful for controlling the rust pathogens in our changing environments.

"African trypanosomes express three virtually identical non-selenium glutathione peroxidase (Px)-type enzymes which preferably detoxify lipid-derived hydroperoxides. As shown previously, bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei lacking the mitochondrial Px III display only a weak and transient proliferation defect whereas parasites that lack the cytosolic Px I and Px II undergo extremely fast lipid peroxidation and cell lysis. The phenotype can completely be rescued by supplementing the medium with the α-tocopherol derivative Trolox. The mechanism underlying the rapid cell death remained however elusive. Here we show that the lysosome is the origin of the cellular injury. Feeding the px I–II knockout parasites with Alexa Fluor-conjugated dextran or LysoTracker in the presence of Trolox yielded a discrete lysosomal staining. Yet upon withdrawal of the antioxidant, the signal became progressively spread over the whole cell body and was completely lost, respectively. T. brucei acquire iron by endocytosis of host transferrin. Supplementing the medium with iron or transferrin induced, whereas the iron chelator deferoxamine and apo-transferrin attenuated lysis of the px I–II knockout cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy with MitoTracker and antibodies against the lysosomal marker protein p67 revealed that disintegration of the lysosome precedes mitochondrial damage. In vivo experiments confirmed the negligible role of the mitochondrial peroxidase: Mice infected with px III knockout cells displayed only a slightly delayed disease development compared to wild-type parasites. Our data demonstrate that in bloodstream African trypanosomes, the lysosome, not the mitochondrion, is the primary site of oxidative damage and cytosolic trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases protect the lysosome from iron-induced membrane peroxidation. This process appears to be closely linked to the high endocytic rate and distinct iron acquisition mechanisms of the infective stage of T. brucei. The respective knockout of the cytosolic px I–II in the procyclic insect form resulted in cells that were fully viable in Trolox-free medium.
","In many cell types, mitochondria are the main source of intracellular reactive oxygen species but iron-induced oxidative lysosomal damage has been described as well. African trypanosomes are the causative agents of human sleeping sickness and the cattle disease Nagana. The parasites are obligate extracellular pathogens that multiply in the bloodstream and body fluids of their mammalian hosts and as procyclic forms in their insect vector, the tsetse fly. Bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei in which the genes for cytosolic lipid hydroperoxide-detoxifying peroxidases have been knocked out undergo an extremely rapid membrane peroxidation and lyse within less than two hours when they are cultured without an exogenous antioxidant. Here we show that the primary site of intracellular damage is the single terminal lysosome of the parasites. Disintegration of the lysosome clearly precedes damage of the mitochondrion and parasite death. Iron, acquired by the endocytosis of iron-loaded host transferrin, induces cell lysis. Contrary to the cytosolic enzymes, the respective mitochondrial peroxidase is dispensable for both in vitro proliferation and mouse infectivity. This is the first report demonstrating that cytosolic thiol peroxidases are responsible for protecting the lysosome of a cell.

"SUMO modification of transcription factors is linked to repression of transcription. The physiological significance of SUMO attachment to a particular transcriptional regulator, however, is largely unknown. We have employed the ubiquitously expressed murine transcription factor Sp3 to analyze the role of SUMOylation in vivo. We generated mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying a subtle point mutation in the SUMO attachment sequence of Sp3 (IKEE553D mutation). The E553D mutation impedes SUMOylation of Sp3 at K551 in vivo, without affecting Sp3 protein levels. Expression profiling revealed that spermatocyte-specific genes, such as Dmc1 and Dnahc8, and neuronal genes, including Paqr6, Rims3, and Robo3, are de-repressed in non-testicular and extra-neuronal mouse tissues and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing the SUMOylation-deficient Sp3E553D mutant protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that transcriptional de-repression of these genes is accompanied by the loss of repressive heterochromatic marks such as H3K9 and H4K20 tri-methylation and impaired recruitment of repressive chromatin-modifying enzymes. Finally, analysis of the DNA methylation state of the Dmc1, Paqr6, and Rims3 promoters by bisulfite sequencing revealed that these genes are highly methylated in Sp3wt MEFs but are unmethylated in Sp3E553D MEFs linking SUMOylation of Sp3 to tissue-specific CpG methylation. Our results establish SUMO conjugation to Sp3 as a molecular beacon for the assembly of repression machineries to maintain tissue-specific transcriptional gene silencing.
","Cell type–specific gene expression patterns are largely regulated by positively or negatively acting transcription factors binding to promoter and enhancer elements. The ubiquitous transcription factor Sp3 represents a paradigm for a dual function transcription factor as it can activate and repress transcription. The repression function of Sp3 is mediated by attachment of a small protein designated SUMO to a single lysine residue. SUMOylation of Sp3 thus acts as a molecular switch that determines whether Sp3 acts as an activator or repressor. In this study, we have generated mice with a subtle mutation in the SUMO attachment site of Sp3. We found that several spermatocyte- and brain-specific genes that are silenced in non-testicular and extra-neuronal tissues of wild-type animals become aberrantly de-repressed in mice in which the SUMO attachment site of Sp3 is mutated. De-repression of these genes is accompanied with dramatic epigenetic changes including the loss of repressive histone methylation marks and, most significantly, loss of DNA methylation. Our findings suggest that SUMO modification of a transcription factor can act as a molecular beacon for the assembly of repression machineries to maintain tissue-specific transcriptional gene silencing in vivo.

"Because physical form and function are intimately linked, mechanisms that maintain cell shape and size within strict limits are likely to be important for a wide variety of biological processes. However, while intrinsic controls have been found to contribute to the relatively well-defined shape of bacteria and yeast cells, the extent to which individual cells from a multicellular animal control their plastic form remains unclear. Here, using micropatterned lines to limit cell extension to one dimension, we show that cells spread to a characteristic steady-state length that is independent of cell size, pattern width, and cortical actin. Instead, homeostatic length control on lines depends on a population of dynamic microtubules that lead during cell extension, and that are aligned along the long cell axis as the result of interactions of microtubule plus ends with the lateral cell cortex. Similarly, during the development of the zebrafish neural tube, elongated neuroepithelial cells maintain a relatively well-defined length that is independent of cell size but dependent upon oriented microtubules. A simple, quantitative model of cellular extension driven by microtubules recapitulates cell elongation on lines, the steady-state distribution of microtubules, and cell length homeostasis, and predicts the effects of microtubule inhibitors on cell length. Together this experimental and theoretical analysis suggests that microtubule dynamics impose unexpected limits on cell geometry that enable cells to regulate their length. Since cells are the building blocks and architects of tissue morphogenesis, such intrinsically defined limits may be important for development and homeostasis in multicellular organisms.
","Because many physical processes change with scale, size control is a fundamental problem for living systems. While in some instances the size of a structure is directly determined by the dimensions of its individual constituents, many biological structures are dynamic, self-organising assemblies of relatively small component parts. How such assemblies are maintained within defined size limits remains poorly understood. Here, by confining cells to spread on lines, we show that animal cells reach a defined length that is independent of their volume and width. In searching for a “ruler” that might determine this axial limit to cell spreading, we identified a population of dynamic microtubule polymers that become oriented along the long axis of cells. This growing population of oriented microtubules drives extension of the spreading cell margin while, conversely, interactions with the cell margin promote microtubule depolymerisation, leading to cell shortening. Using a mathematical model we show that this coupling of dynamic microtubule polymerisation and depolymerisation with directed cell elongation is sufficient to explain the limit to cell spreading and cell length homeostasis. Because microtubules appear to regulate cell length in a similar way in the developing zebrafish neural tube, we suggest that this microtubule-dependent mechanism is likely to be of widespread importance for the regulation of cell and tissue geometry.

"HIV Nef acts as an anti-autophagic maturation factor through interaction with beclin-1 (BECN1). We report that exposure of macrophages to infectious or non-infectious purified HIV induces toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) and BECN1 dependent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and that this correlates with an increase in autophagy markers. RNA interference for ATG13, TFEB, TLR8, or BECN1 inhibits this HIV-induced autophagy. However, once HIV establishes a productive infection, TFEB phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration are increased resulting in decreased autophagy markers. Moreover, by 7 d post-infection, autophagy levels are similar to mock infected controls. Conversely, although Nef deleted HIV similarly induces TFEB dephosphorylation and nuclear localization, and increases autophagy, these levels remain elevated during continued productive infection. Thus, the interaction between HIV and TLR8 serves as a signal for autophagy induction that is dependent upon the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. During permissive infection, Nef binds BECN1 resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) activation, TFEB phosphorylation and cytosolic sequestration, and the inhibition of autophagy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a virus modulating TFEB localization and helps to explain how HIV modulates autophagy to promote its own replication and cell survival.
","Under basal conditions, the mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) phosphorylates transcription factor EB (TFEB) resulting in its cytoplasmic retention. When MTOR is inhibited, TFEB is dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus where it increases autophagy and lysosomal gene expression. As human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) Nef acts as an anti-autophagic maturation factor through interaction with beclin-1 (BECN1), we investigated the role of Nef and TFEB in the modulation of autophagy during HIV infection of human macrophages. We found that upon exposure to HIV, macrophages elicited an autophagic response through a toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) and BECN1 dependent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. However, once HIV infection is established, phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration of TFEB as well as autophagy revert to pre-infection levels. Moreover, this reversion is dependent upon the presence of HIV Nef. Collectively, the data suggests that the interaction between HIV and TLR8 serves as a signal for autophagy induction that is dependent upon the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. Once HIV establishes a productive infection, Nef binds BECN1 resulting in MTOR activation, TFEB phosphorylation and cytosolic sequestration and the inhibition of autophagy.

"Type II germ cell cancers (GCC) can be subdivided into seminomas and non-seminomas. Seminomas are similar to carcinoma in situ (CIS) cells, the common precursor of type II GCCs, with regard to epigenetics and expression, while embryonal carcinomas (EC) are totipotent and differentiate into teratomas, yolk-sac tumors and choriocarcinomas. GCCs can present as seminomas with a non-seminoma component, raising the question if a CIS gives rise to seminomas and ECs at the same time or whether seminomas can be reprogrammed to ECs. In this study, we utilized the seminoma cell line TCam-2 that acquires an EC-like status after xenografting into the murine flank as a model for a seminoma to EC transition and screened for factors initiating and driving this process. Analysis of expression and DNA methylation dynamics during transition of TCam-2 revealed that many pluripotency- and reprogramming-associated genes were upregulated while seminoma-markers were downregulated. Changes in expression level of 53 genes inversely correlated to changes in DNA methylation. Interestingly, after xenotransplantation 6 genes (GDF3, NODAL, DNMT3B, DPPA3, GAL, AK3L1) were rapidly induced, followed by demethylation of their genomic loci, suggesting that these 6 genes are poised for expression driving the reprogramming. We demonstrate that inhibition of BMP signaling is the initial event in reprogramming, resulting in activation of the pluripotency-associated genes and NODAL signaling. We propose that reprogramming of seminomas to ECs is a multi-step process. Initially, the microenvironment causes inhibition of BMP signaling, leading to induction of NODAL signaling. During a maturation phase, a fast acting NODAL loop stimulates its own activity and temporarily inhibits BMP signaling. During the stabilization phase, a slow acting NODAL loop, involving WNTs re-establishes BMP signaling and the pluripotency circuitry. In parallel, DNMT3B-driven de novo methylation silences seminoma-associated genes and epigenetically fixes the EC state.
","The understanding of germ cell cancer pathogenesis is based on a linear model, where seminomas and non-seminomas represent distinct entities, although originating from a common precursor lesion, the carcinoma in situ. We demonstrate that germ cell cancer development is a microenvironment-dependent plastic process that allows latent pluripotent seminomas /TCam-2 to acquire primed pluripotency and transit into an EC. For the first time, we show that this plasticity is initiated after interference with BMP signaling and driven by NODAL signaling, which is accompanied by considerable remodeling of the methylome. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that ECs might also be able to transit into a seminoma upon interference with the drivers of reprogramming identified in this study.

"Longquan City, Zhejiang province, China, has been seriously affected by hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) since the first cases were registered in 1974. To understand the epidemiology and emergence of HFRS in Longquan, which may be indicative of large parts of rural China, we studied long-term incidence patterns and performed a molecular epidemiological investigation of the causative hantaviruses in human and rodent populations.
During 1974–2011, 1866 cases of HFRS were recorded in Longquan, including 20 deaths. In 2011, the incidence of HFRS remained high, with 19.61 cases/100,000 population, despite the onset of vaccination in 1997. During 1974–1998, HFRS cases in Longquan occurred mainly in winter, while in the past decade the peak of HFRS has shifted to the spring. Notably, the concurrent prevalence of rodent-borne hantaviruses in the region was also high. Phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences recovered from rodents in Longquan revealed the presence of novel genetic variants of Gou virus (GOUV) in Rattus sp. rats and Hantaan virus (HTNV) in the stripe field mice, respectively. Strikingly, viral sequences sampled from infected humans were very closely related to those from rodents.
HFRS represents an important public health problem in Longquan even after years of preventive measures. Our data suggest that continual spillover of the novel genetic variant of GOUV and the new genetic lineage of HTNV are responsible for the high prevalence of HFRS in humans. In addition, this is the first report of GOUV associated with human HFRS cases, and our data suggest that GOUV is now the major cause of HFRS in this region.
","Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a major public health problem in China despite human vaccination. We investigated the epidemiology and emergence of HFRS in Longquan (Zhejiang Province), a rural area with a high incidence of HFRS. During 1974–2011, a total of 1866 cases of HFRS were recorded in Longquan, including 20 deaths.

Moreover, viral sequences sampled from infected humans in Longquan were very closely related to those from rodents. Overall, these data indicate that there is a continual spillover GOUV and HTNV from rodents to humans in Longquan, and this might be responsible for the high prevalence of HFRS. As well as highlighting the importance of the human-animal interface, these data also suggest that GOUV is now the major cause of HFRS in this region.

"Epilepsy—the condition of recurrent, unprovoked seizures—manifests in brain voltage activity with characteristic spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns include stereotyped semi-rhythmic activity produced by aggregate neuronal populations, and organized spatiotemporal phenomena, including waves. To assess these spatiotemporal patterns, we develop a mathematical model consistent with the observed neuronal population activity and determine analytically the parameter configurations that support traveling wave solutions. We then utilize high-density local field potential data recorded in vivo from human cortex preceding seizure termination from three patients to constrain the model parameters, and propose basic mechanisms that contribute to the observed traveling waves. We conclude that a relatively simple and abstract mathematical model consisting of localized interactions between excitatory cells with slow adaptation captures the quantitative features of wave propagation observed in the human local field potential preceding seizure termination.
","Nearly 50 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Although some clinical and biological principles of seizures are known, many aspects of spontaneous human seizures remain poorly understood. Recordings from electrodes placed directly on and within the brain provide a unique view of seizure activity, and have revealed specific brain voltage patterns associated with this pathological state. In particular, there is evidence that organized waves of activity propagate over the brain during a seizure. However, quantitatively characterizing and understanding the mechanisms that support these waves remains an open challenge. The goal of this work is to address this challenge through a combination of mathematical modeling and clinical recordings. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we seek to understand general features that support the spatiotemporal patterns of seizure termination. We propose that a relatively simple and abstract mathematical model consisting of localized interactions of closely neighboring excitatory cells with slow adaptation can support the propagation of the waves found in clinical recordings. Improved understanding of the mechanisms supporting seizure activity promises novel developments in treatment strategies tailored to the observed activity of individual patients.

"The healing of a fracture depends largely on the development of a new blood vessel network (angiogenesis) in the callus. During angiogenesis tip cells lead the developing sprout in response to extracellular signals, amongst which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical. In order to ensure a correct development of the vasculature, the balance between stalk and tip cell phenotypes must be tightly controlled, which is primarily achieved by the Dll4-Notch1 signaling pathway. This study presents a novel multiscale model of osteogenesis and sprouting angiogenesis, incorporating lateral inhibition of endothelial cells (further denoted MOSAIC model) through Dll4-Notch1 signaling, and applies it to fracture healing. The MOSAIC model correctly predicted the bone regeneration process and recapitulated many experimentally observed aspects of tip cell selection: the salt and pepper pattern seen for cell fates, an increased tip cell density due to the loss of Dll4 and an excessive number of tip cells in high VEGF environments. When VEGF concentration was even further increased, the MOSAIC model predicted the absence of a vascular network and fracture healing, thereby leading to a non-union, which is a direct consequence of the mutual inhibition of neighboring cells through Dll4-Notch1 signaling. This result was not retrieved for a more phenomenological model that only considers extracellular signals for tip cell migration, which illustrates the importance of implementing the actual signaling pathway rather than phenomenological rules. Finally, the MOSAIC model demonstrated the importance of a proper criterion for tip cell selection and the need for experimental data to further explore this. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the MOSAIC model creates enhanced capabilities for investigating the influence of molecular mechanisms on angiogenesis and its relation to bone formation in a more mechanistic way and across different time and spatial scales.
","The healing of a fracture largely depends on the development of a new blood vessel network (angiogenesis), which can be investigated and simulated with mathematical models. The current mathematical models of angiogenesis during fracture healing do not, however, implement all relevant biological scales (e.g. a tissue, cellular and intracellular level) rigorously in a multiscale framework. This study established a novel multiscale platform of angiogenesis during fracture healing (called MOSAIC) which allowed us to investigate the interactions of several influential factors across the different biological scales. We focused on the biological process of tip cell selection, during which a specific cell of a blood vessel, the “tip cell”, is selected to migrate away from the original vessel and lead the new branch. After showing that the MOSAIC model is able to correctly predict the bone regeneration process as well as many experimentally observed aspects of tip cell selection, we have used the model to investigate the influence of stimulating signals on the development of the vasculature and the progression of healing. These results raised an important biological question concerning the criterion for tip cell selection. This study demonstrates the potential of multiscale modeling to contribute to the understanding of biological processes like angiogenesis.

"DNA double-strand breaks are repaired by multiple mechanisms that are roughly grouped into the categories of homology-directed repair and non-homologous end joining. End-joining repair can be further classified as either classical non-homologous end joining, which requires DNA ligase 4, or “alternative” end joining, which does not. Alternative end joining has been associated with genomic deletions and translocations, but its molecular mechanism(s) are largely uncharacterized. Here, we report that Drosophila melanogaster DNA polymerase theta (pol theta), encoded by the mus308 gene and previously implicated in DNA interstrand crosslink repair, plays a crucial role in DNA ligase 4-independent alternative end joining. In the absence of pol theta, end joining is impaired and residual repair often creates large deletions flanking the break site. Analysis of break repair junctions from flies with mus308 separation-of-function alleles suggests that pol theta promotes the use of long microhomologies during alternative end joining and increases the likelihood of complex insertion events. Our results establish pol theta as a key protein in alternative end joining in Drosophila and suggest a potential mechanistic link between alternative end joining and interstrand crosslink repair.
","DNA double-strand breaks, in which both strands of the DNA double helix are cut, must be recognized and accurately repaired in order to promote cell survival and prevent the accumulation of mutations. However, error-prone repair occasionally occurs, even when accurate repair is possible. We have investigated the genetic requirements of an error-prone break-repair mechanism called alternative end joining. We have previously shown that alternative end joining is frequently used in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we demonstrate that a fruit fly protein named DNA polymerase theta is a key player in this inaccurate repair mechanism. Genetic analysis suggests that polymerase theta may be important for two processes associated with alternative end joining: (1) annealing at short, complementary DNA sequences, and (2) DNA synthesis that creates small insertions at break-repair sites. In the absence of polymerase theta, a backup repair mechanism that frequently results in large chromosome deletions is revealed. Because DNA polymerase theta is highly expressed in many types of human cancers, our findings lay the groundwork for further investigations into how polymerase theta is involved in repair processes that may promote the development of cancer.

"The exosome complex functions in RNA metabolism and transcriptional gene silencing. Here, we report that mutations of two Arabidopsis genes encoding nuclear exosome components AtRRP6L1 and AtRRP6L2, cause de-repression of the main flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and thus delay flowering in early-flowering Arabidopsis ecotypes. AtRRP6L mutations affect the expression of known FLC regulatory antisense (AS) RNAs AS I and II, and cause an increase in Histone3 K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at FLC. AtRRP6L1 and AtRRP6L2 function redundantly in regulation of FLC and also act independently of the exosome core complex. Moreover, we discovered a novel, long non-coding, non-polyadenylated antisense transcript (ASL, for Antisense Long) originating from the FLC locus in wild type plants. The AtRRP6L proteins function as the main regulators of ASL synthesis, as these mutants show little or no ASL transcript. Unlike ASI/II, ASL associates with H3K27me3 regions of FLC, suggesting that it could function in the maintenance of H3K27 trimethylation during vegetative growth. AtRRP6L mutations also affect H3K27me3 levels and nucleosome density at the FLC locus. Furthermore, AtRRP6L1 physically associates with the ASL transcript and directly interacts with the FLC locus. We propose that AtRRP6L proteins participate in the maintenance of H3K27me3 at FLC via regulating ASL. Furthermore, AtRRP6Ls might participate in multiple FLC silencing pathways by regulating diverse antisense RNAs derived from the FLC locus.
","Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) delays flowering; therefore, repressing expression of FLC provides a critical mechanism to regulate flowering. This mechanism involves multiple levels of regulation, including genetic regulation by transcription factors, and epigenetic regulation by modifications of genomic DNA and histones at the FLC locus. This work examines the role of non-coding RNAs in the epigenetic regulation of FLC, finding that the different RNAs produced from the FLC locus may have different functions in altering the epigenetic landscape at the FLC locus, and revealing that AtRRP6L1 and AtRRP6L2, two components of the exosome, an RNA-processing complex, play roles in regulating these non-coding RNAs. Therefore, this work explores the complex ties between RNA processing, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic regulation of FLC, a key repressor of flowering.

"RNA polyadenylation (pA) is one of the major steps in regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. In this report, a genome landscape of pA sites of viral transcripts in B lymphocytes with Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection was constructed using a modified PA-seq strategy. We identified 67 unique pA sites, of which 55 could be assigned for expression of annotated ∼90 KSHV genes. Among the assigned pA sites, twenty are for expression of individual single genes and the rest for multiple genes (average 2.7 genes per pA site) in cluster-gene loci of the genome. A few novel viral pA sites that could not be assigned to any known KSHV genes are often positioned in the antisense strand to ORF8, ORF21, ORF34, K8 and ORF50, and their associated antisense mRNAs to ORF21, ORF34 and K8 could be verified by 3′RACE. The usage of each mapped pA site correlates to its peak size, the larger (broad and wide) peak size, the more usage and thus, the higher expression of the pA site-associated gene(s). Similar to mammalian transcripts, KSHV RNA polyadenylation employs two major poly(A) signals, AAUAAA and AUUAAA, and is regulated by conservation of cis-elements flanking the mapped pA sites. Moreover, we found two or more alternative pA sites downstream of ORF54, K2 (vIL6), K9 (vIRF1), K10.5 (vIRF3), K11 (vIRF2), K12 (Kaposin A), T1.5, and PAN genes and experimentally validated the alternative polyadenylation for the expression of KSHV ORF54, K11, and T1.5 transcripts. Together, our data provide not only a comprehensive pA site landscape for understanding KSHV genome structure and gene expression, but also the first evidence of alternative polyadenylation as another layer of posttranscriptional regulation in viral gene expression.
","A genome-wide polyadenylation landscape in the expression of human herpesviruses has not been reported. In this study, we provide the first genome landscape of viral RNA polyadenylation sites in B cells from KSHV latent to lytic infection by using a modified PA-seq protocol and selectively validated by 3′ RACE. We found that KSHV genome contains 67 active pA sites for the expression of its ∼90 genes and a few antisense transcripts. Among the mapped pA sites, a large fraction of them are for the expression of cluster genes and the production of bicistronic or polycistronic transcripts from KSHV genome and only one-third are used for the expression of single genes. We found that the size of individual PA peaks is positively correlated with the usage of corresponding pA site, which is determined by the number of reads within the PA peak from latent to lytic KSHV infection, and the strength of cis-elements surrounding KSHV pA site determines the expression level of viral genes. Lastly, we identified and experimentally validated alternative polyadenylation of KSHV ORF54, T1.5, and K11 during viral lytic infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report on alternative polyadenylation events in KSHV infection.

"Following an infectious challenge, macrophages have to be activated in order to allow efficient clearance of infectious pathogens, but how macrophage activation is coupled to increased clearance remains largely unknown. We here describe that inflammatory stimuli induced the reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, allowing the rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. Reprogramming occurred through protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, thereby activating phosphoinositol (PI)-3-kinase activity necessary for macropinocytic uptake. Expression of a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 was sufficient to induce PI3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. Together these results suggest a hitherto unknown mechanism to regulate the internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation.
","The main cells that are involved in cleaning up microbial pathogens are macrophages. Upon an infection, macrophages are being recruited to the site of infection by a number of different stimuli. In addition, during an infection, macrophages are also activated by cytokines such as interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α that is released from other immune cells. Such macrophage activation is important to achieve a rapid and efficient clearance of microbial pathogens. In this study, we found that macrophage activation induces uptake through macropinocytosis rather than receptor-mediate phagocytosis. As a consequence, microbial material as well as particles can be internalized far more efficiently; In addition, the internalized cargo is rapidly destroyed within lysosomes. We also provide the mechanisms for the switch from phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, which turned out to be the cytokine-induced phosphorylation of the host protein coronin 1. Phosphorylated coronin 1 activated the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which is known to be responsible for the entry of cargo through macropinocytosis. Together these results provide evidence for a hitherto unrecognized mechanisms to regulate the internalization and degradation of infectious material during an infection.

"Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is a necrotizing skin disease usually starting with a subcutaneous nodule or plaque, which may ulcerate and progress, if untreated, over months and years. During the currently recommended antibiotic treatment with rifampicin/streptomycin plaque lesions tend to ulcerate, often associated with retarded wound healing and prolonged hospital stays.
Included in this study were twelve laboratory reconfirmed, HIV negative BU patients presenting with plaque lesions at the CDTUB in Allada, Benin. Punch biopsies for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis were taken before start of treatment and after four to five weeks of treatment. Where excision or wound debridement was clinically indicated, the removed tissue was also analyzed. Based on clinical judgment, nine of the twelve patients enrolled in this study received limited surgical excision seven to 39 days after completion of chemotherapy, followed by skin grafting. Lesions of three patients healed without further intervention. Before treatment, plaque lesions were characterized by a destroyed subcutis with extensive necrosis without major signs of infiltration. After completion of antibiotic treatment partial infiltration of the affected tissue was observed, but large necrotic areas remained unchanged.
Our histopathological analyses show that ulceration of plaque lesions during antibiotic treatment do not represent a failure to respond to antimycobacterial treatment. Based on our results we suggest formal testing in a controlled clinical trial setting whether limited surgical excision of necrotic tissue favours wound healing and can reduce the duration of hospital stays.
","The tropical necrotizing skin disease Buruli ulcer (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is associated with extensive tissue destruction and local immunosuppression caused by the macrolide exotoxin mycolactone. Chemotherapy with a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin for 8 weeks is the currently recommended treatment for all types of BU lesions, including both ulcerative and non-ulcerative stages (plaques, nodules and edema). Our histopathological analysis of twelve BU plaque lesions revealed extensive destruction of sub-cutaneous tissue. This frequently led to ulceration during antibiotic treatment. This should not be mistaken as a failure of the antimycobacterial chemotherapy, since we found no evidence for the persistence of active infection foci. Large necrotic areas were found to persist even after completion of antibiotic treatment. These may disturb wound healing and the role of wound debridement should therefore be formally tested in a clinical trial setting.

"The type III interferon (IFNλ) receptor IL-28R is abundantly expressed in the respiratory tract and has been shown essential for host defense against some viral pathogens, however no data are available concerning its role in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced significant production of IFNλ in the lung, and clearance of these bacteria from the lung was significantly increased in IL-28R null mice compared to controls. Improved bacterial clearance correlated with reduced lung pathology and a reduced ratio of pro- vs anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway. In human epithelial cells IFNλ inhibited miR-21 via STAT3 resulting in upregulation of PDCD4, a protein known to promote inflammatory signaling. In vivo 18 hours following infection with either pathogen, miR-21 was significantly reduced and PDCD4 increased in the lungs of wild type compared to IL-28R null mice. Infection of PDCD4 null mice with USA300 resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production. These data suggest that during bacterial pneumonia IFNλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4.
","The role of interferons (types I, II, and III) in viral and bacterial infections has been a topic of intense research over the last decade. The contribution of the type I interferons during bacterial pneumonias particularly has been shown to be highly variable depending on the specific pathogen. Our data for the first time demonstrate that type III interferon plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia, and its contribution is similar in both Gram positive and Gram negative infections. We show in epithelial cells that miR-21 and PDCD4 are downstream effectors of type III interferon that prolong production of inflammatory cytokines. Utilizing mice that lack the receptor for type III interferon or PDCD4, we show that inhibiting this pathway improves bacterial clearance from the airways and lung tissue. These data suggest novel targets for therapy in a variety of bacterial pneumonias.

"The human immune system depends on a highly diverse collection of antibody-making B cells. B cell receptor sequence diversity is generated by a random recombination process called “rearrangement” forming progenitor B cells, then a Darwinian process of lineage diversification and selection called “affinity maturation.” The resulting receptors can be sequenced in high throughput for research and diagnostics. Such a collection of sequences contains a mixture of various lineages, each of which may be quite numerous, or may consist of only a single member. As a step to understanding the process and result of this diversification, one may wish to reconstruct lineage membership, i.e. to cluster sampled sequences according to which came from the same rearrangement events. We call this clustering problem “clonal family inference.” In this paper we describe and validate a likelihood-based framework for clonal family inference based on a multi-hidden Markov Model (multi-HMM) framework for B cell receptor sequences. We describe an agglomerative algorithm to find a maximum likelihood clustering, two approximate algorithms with various trade-offs of speed versus accuracy, and a third, fast algorithm for finding specific lineages. We show that under simulation these algorithms greatly improve upon existing clonal family inference methods, and that they also give significantly different clusters than previous methods when applied to two real data sets.
","Antibodies must recognize a great diversity of antigens to protect us from infectious disease. The binding properties of antibodies are determined by the DNA sequences of their corresponding B cell receptors (BCRs). These BCR sequences are created in naive form by VDJ recombination, which randomly selects and trims the ends of V, D, and J genes, then joins the resulting segments together with additional random nucleotides. If they pass initial screening and bind an antigen, these sequences then undergo an evolutionary process of reproduction, mutation, and selection, revising the BCR to improve binding to its cognate antigen. It has recently become possible to determine the BCR sequences resulting from this process in high throughput. Although these sequences implicitly contain a wealth of information about both antigen exposure and the process by which we learn to resist pathogens, this information can only be extracted using computer algorithms. In this paper we describe a likelihood-based statistical method to determine, given a collection of BCR sequences, which of them are derived from the same recombination events. It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) of VDJ rearrangement which is able to calculate likelihoods for many sequences at once.

"Viral infection induces innate immunity and apoptosis. Apoptosis is an effective means to sacrifice virus-infected host cells and therefore restrict the spread of pathogens. However, the underlying mechanisms of this process are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/Cardif/IPS-1) is critical for SeV (Sendai virus)-induced apoptosis. MAVS specifically activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) but not other MAP kinases. Jnk2−/− cells, but not Jnk1−/− cells, are unable to initiate virus-induced apoptosis and SeV further fails to trigger apoptosis in MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) knockout (Mkk7−/−) cells. Mechanistically, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria via its 3D domain, which subsequently phosphorylates JNK2 and thus activates the apoptosis pathway. Consistently, Jnk2−/− mice, but not Jnk1−/− mice, display marked inflammatory injury in lung and liver after viral challenge. Collectively, we have identified a novel signaling pathway, involving MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, which mediates virus-induced apoptosis and highlights the indispensable role of mitochondrial outer membrane in host defenses.
","The mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/Cardif/IPS-1) is critical for the innate immune response during viral infection, and its function has been well documented in mediating type I interferon production. In this study, we revealed the essential role of MAVS in virus-induced apoptosis, independent of Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I (RIG-I) signaling. Upon viral infection, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria, followed by MKK7 induced activation of JNK2, which subsequently initiates apoptosis. Importantly, we have clearly differentiated the roles of JNK2 versus JNK1, and MKK7 versus MKK4 in virus-induced apoptosis. Thus, we define a novel apoptotic signaling pathway, involving MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, which sheds a new perspective on the crosstalk between the antiviral and apoptotic signaling pathways in innate immunity.

"We have previously identified and characterized the phenomenon of ectopic human centromeres, known as neocentromeres. Human neocentromeres form epigenetically at euchromatic chromosomal sites and are structurally and functionally similar to normal human centromeres. Recent studies have indicated that neocentromere formation provides a major mechanism for centromere repositioning, karyotype evolution, and speciation. Using a marker chromosome mardel(10) containing a neocentromere formed at the normal chromosomal 10q25 region, we have previously mapped a 330-kb CENP-A–binding domain and described an increased prevalence of L1 retrotransposons in the underlying DNA sequences of the CENP-A–binding clusters. Here, we investigated the potential role of the L1 retrotransposons in the regulation of neocentromere activity. Determination of the transcriptional activity of a panel of full-length L1s (FL-L1s) across a 6-Mb region spanning the 10q25 neocentromere chromatin identified one of the FL-L1 retrotransposons, designated FL-L1b and residing centrally within the CENP-A–binding clusters, to be transcriptionally active. We demonstrated the direct incorporation of the FL-L1b RNA transcripts into the CENP-A–associated chromatin. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the FL-L1b RNA transcripts led to a reduction in CENP-A binding and an impaired mitotic function of the 10q25 neocentromere. These results indicate that LINE retrotransposon RNA is a previously undescribed essential structural and functional component of the neocentromeric chromatin and that retrotransposable elements may serve as a critical epigenetic determinant in the chromatin remodelling events leading to neocentromere formation.
","The centromere is an essential chromosomal structure for the correct segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Normal human centromeres comprise a 171-bp α-satellite DNA arranged into tandem and higher-order arrays. Neocentromeres are fully functional centromeres that form epigenetically on noncentromeric regions of the chromosomes, with recent evidence indicating an important role they play in centromere repositioning, karyotype evolution, and speciation. Neocentromeres contain fully definable DNA sequences and provide a tractable system for the molecular analysis of the centromere chromatin. Here, the authors investigate the role of epigenetic determinants in the regulation of neocentromere structure and function. They identify that a retrotransposable DNA element found within the neocentromere domain is actively transcribed and that the transcribed RNA is essential for the structural and functional integrity of the neocentromere. This study defines a previously undescribed epigenetic determinant that regulates the neocentromeric chromatin and provides insight into the mechanism of neocentromere formation and centromere repositioning.

"Intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis have evolved strategies for coping with the pressures encountered inside host cells. The ability to coordinate global gene expression in response to environmental and internal cues is one key to their success. Prolonged survival and replication within macrophages, a key virulence trait of M. tuberculosis, requires dynamic adaptation to diverse and changing conditions within its phagosomal niche. However, the physiological adaptations during the different phases of this infection process remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed a multi-tiered approach to define the temporal patterns of gene expression in M. tuberculosis in a macrophage infection model that extends from infection, through intracellular adaptation, to the establishment of a productive infection. Using a clock plasmid to measure intracellular replication and death rates over a 14-day infection and electron microscopy to define bacterial integrity, we observed an initial period of rapid replication coupled with a high death rate. This was followed by period of slowed growth and enhanced intracellular survival, leading finally to an extended period of net growth. The transcriptional profiles of M. tuberculosis reflect these physiological transitions as the bacterium adapts to conditions within its host cell. Finally, analysis with a Transcriptional Regulatory Network model revealed linked genetic networks whereby M. tuberculosis coordinates global gene expression during intracellular survival. The integration of molecular and cellular biology together with transcriptional profiling and systems analysis offers unique insights into the host-driven responses of intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis.
","The impact of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on global health is undeniable, with ∼2 million deaths and ∼9 million new cases of tuberculosis each year. A key to the success of M. tuberculosis as a persistent, intracellular pathogen is its ability to survive for extended periods within professional phagocytes. Sustained growth within macrophage phagosomes requires avoiding or resisting antimicrobial mechanisms and adapting to replicate in a stressful, nutrient-restricted environment. Our understanding of the survival strategies, metabolism, and physiology of M. tuberculosis during intracellular growth remains incomplete. We employed multi-disciplinary approaches to gain new insights into adaptive responses that M. tuberculosis mobilizes to secure a productive infection. We simultaneously quantified replication and death rates, used electron microscopy to evaluate bacterial integrity, and determined the temporal changes in bacterial gene expression during a 14-day infection. By overlaying this temporal transcriptome dataset onto an extended Transcriptional Regulatory Network model, we identified regulatory pathways, stress responses, and metabolic adaptations activated during key physiological transitions over the 14 days of infection.

"Control of the differential abundance or activity of tRNAs can be important determinants of gene regulation. RNA polymerase (RNAP) III synthesizes all tRNAs in eukaryotes and it derepression is associated with cancer. Maf1 is a conserved general repressor of RNAP III under the control of the target of rapamycin (TOR) that acts to integrate transcriptional output and protein synthetic demand toward metabolic economy. Studies in budding yeast have indicated that the global tRNA gene activation that occurs with derepression of RNAP III via maf1-deletion is accompanied by a paradoxical loss of tRNA-mediated nonsense suppressor activity, manifested as an antisuppression phenotype, by an unknown mechanism. We show that maf1-antisuppression also occurs in the fission yeast S. pombe amidst general activation of RNAP III. We used tRNA-HydroSeq to document that little changes occurred in the relative levels of different tRNAs in maf1Δ cells. By contrast, the efficiency of N2,N2-dimethyl G26 (m22G26) modification on certain tRNAs was decreased in response to maf1-deletion and associated with antisuppression, and was validated by other methods. Over-expression of Trm1, which produces m22G26, reversed maf1-antisuppression. A model that emerges is that competition by increased tRNA levels in maf1Δ cells leads to m22G26 hypomodification due to limiting Trm1, reducing the activity of suppressor-tRNASerUCA and accounting for antisuppression. Consistent with this, we show that RNAP III mutations associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy decrease tRNA transcription, increase m22G26 efficiency and reverse antisuppression. Extending this more broadly, we show that a decrease in tRNA synthesis by treatment with rapamycin leads to increased m22G26 modification and that this response is conserved among highly divergent yeasts and human cells.
","Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are molecular adapters necessary for translation of the genetic code from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) to synthesis of the proteins that constitute the energy producing enzymes and structural components of all cells and organisms on earth. In eukaryotic cells, tRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase III (RNAP III). Proteins are composed of different amino acids, sequentially arranged according to the triplet sequence code, each carried to the ribosome by a different tRNA which reads or decodes the triplet sequence of the mRNA. After their synthesis by RNAP III, tRNAs are chemically modified by enzymes on multiple of their nucleosides. Here we report that one of these modifications, dimethyl-guanine-26 (m22G26) varies in the efficiency by which it is added to its target tRNAs, in a manner that is dependent on the overall activity rate of RNAP III. We show that this is important because the m22G26 modification activates the tRNA for function to translate the code. This link between RNAP III activity rate and m22G26 modification efficiency was previously unknown, and we show that it is conserved from yeast to human cells.

"Little is known about the relative contributions and importance of antibacterial effectors in the nematode C. elegans, despite extensive work on the innate immune responses in this organism. We report an investigation of the expression, function and regulation of the six ilys (invertebrate-type lysozyme) genes of C. elegans. These genes exhibited a surprising variety of tissue-specific expression patterns and responses to starvation or bacterial infection. The most strongly expressed, ilys-3, was investigated in detail. ILYS-3 protein was expressed constitutively in the pharynx and coelomocytes, and dynamically in the intestine. Analysis of mutants showed that ILYS-3 was required for pharyngeal grinding (disruption of bacterial cells) during normal growth and consequently it contributes to longevity, as well as being protective against bacterial pathogens. Both starvation and challenge with Gram-positive pathogens resulted in ERK-MAPK-dependent up-regulation of ilys-3 in the intestine. The intestinal induction by pathogens, but not starvation, was found to be dependent on MPK-1 activity in the pharynx rather than in the intestine, demonstrating unexpected communication between these two tissues. The coelomocyte expression appeared to contribute little to normal growth or immunity. Recombinant ILYS-3 protein was found to exhibit appropriate lytic activity against Gram-positive cell wall material.
","Innate immune defenses against bacterial pathogenesis depend on the activation of antibacterial factors. We examined the expression and relative importance of a gene family encoding six invertebrate-type lysozymes in the much-studied nematode C. elegans. The ilys genes exhibit distinct patterns of tissue-specific expression and response to pathogenic challenge and/or starvation. The most abundantly expressed, ilys-3, exhibits constitutive pharyngeal expression, which we show is essential for efficient disruption of bacteria under non-pathogenic growth conditions, and consequently it contributes to normal longevity. ilys-3 is also strongly up-regulated in intestinal cells after starvation or exposure to Gram-positive pathogens such as Microbacterium nematophilum and acts as a ‘slow-effector’ in limiting pathogenic damage from intestinal infections. We show that this induction by pathogens depends on the action of an ERK-MAPK cascade, which acts in pharyngeal rather than intestinal cells; this implies communication between pharynx and intestine. Tagged ILYS-3 protein was detected mainly in recycling endosomes of intestinal cells and in the intestinal lumen after starvation. ILYS-3 was also expressed in coelomocytes (scavenger cells) but we found that these cells make little or no contribution to defense. We examined the enzymatic properties of recombinant ILYS-3 protein, finding that it has lytic activity against M. nematophilum cell-walls.

"Plasmid conjugation plays a significant role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity determinants. Understanding how conjugation is regulated is important to gain insights into these features. Little is known about regulation of conjugation systems present on plasmids from Gram-positive bacteria. pLS20 is a native conjugative plasmid from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Recently the key players that repress and activate pLS20 conjugation have been identified. Here we studied in detail the molecular mechanism regulating the pLS20 conjugation genes using both in vivo and in vitro approaches. Our results show that conjugation is subject to the control of a complex genetic switch where at least three levels of regulation are integrated. The first of the three layers involves overlapping divergent promoters of different strengths regulating expression of the conjugation genes and the key transcriptional regulator RcoLS20. The second layer involves a triple function of RcoLS20 being a repressor of the main conjugation promoter and an activator and repressor of its own promoter at low and high concentrations, respectively. The third level of regulation concerns formation of a DNA loop mediated by simultaneous binding of tetrameric RcoLS20 to two operators, one of which overlaps with the divergent promoters. The combination of these three layers of regulation in the same switch allows the main conjugation promoter to be tightly repressed during conditions unfavorable to conjugation while maintaining the sensitivity to accurately switch on the conjugation genes when appropriate conditions occur. The implications of the regulatory switch and comparison with other genetic switches involving DNA looping are discussed.
","Plasmids are extrachromosomal, autonomously replicating units that are harbored by many bacteria. Many plasmids encode transfer function allowing them to be transferred into plasmid-free bacteria by a process named conjugation. Since many of them also carry antibiotic resistance genes, plasmid-mediated conjugation is a major mechanism in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. In depth knowledge on the regulation of conjugation genes is a prerequisite to design measures interfering with the spread of antibiotic resistance. pLS20 is a conjugative plasmid of the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which is also a gut commensal in animals and humans. Here we describe in detail the molecular mechanism by which the key transcriptional regulator tightly represses the conjugation genes during conditions unfavorable to conjugation without compromising the ability to switch on accurately the conjugation genes when appropriate. We found that conjugation is subject to the control of a unique genetic switch where at least three levels of regulation are integrated. The first level involves overlapping divergent promoters of different strengths. The second layer involves a triple function of the transcriptional regulator. And the third level of regulation concerns formation of a DNA loop mediated by the transcriptional regulator.

"The cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F exert anti–HIV-1 activity that is countered by the HIV-1 vif protein. Based on potential transcription factor binding sites in their putative promoters, we hypothesized that expression of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F would vary with T helper lymphocyte differentiation. Naive CD4+ T lymphocytes were differentiated to T helper type 1 (Th1) and 2 (Th2) effector cells by expression of transcription factors Tbet and GATA3, respectively, as well as by cytokine polarization. APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F RNA levels, and APOBEC3G protein levels, were higher in Th1 than in Th2 cells. T cell receptor stimulation further increased APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F expression in Tbet- and control-transduced, but not in GATA3-transduced, cells. Neutralizing anti–interferon-γ antibodies reduced both basal and T cell receptor-stimulated APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F expression in Tbet- and control-transduced cells. HIV-1 produced from Th1 cells had more virion APOBEC3G, and decreased infectivity, compared to virions produced from Th2 cells. These differences between Th1- and Th2-produced virions were greater for viruses lacking functional vif, but also seen with vif-positive viruses. Over-expression of APOBEC3G in Th2 cells decreased the infectivity of virions produced from Th2 cells, and reduction of APOBEC3G in Th1 cells increased infectivity of virions produced from Th1 cells, consistent with a causal role for APOBEC3G in the infectivity difference. These results indicate that APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F levels vary physiologically during CD4+ T lymphocyte differentiation, that interferon-γ contributes to this modulation, and that this physiological regulation can cause changes in infectivity of progeny virions, even in the presence of HIV-1 vif.
","Some host cell proteins can hinder, or restrict, the life cycle of HIV-1. APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F are cellular enzymes that decrease HIV-1's ability to replicate in a subsequent target cell if they are present in the virus particle. As a countermeasure, HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (vif) induces degradation of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, thereby preventing them from getting into the budding virus. Although vif-defective viruses cannot evade the antiviral effect of APOBEC3G, such viruses are very rarely present in HIV-1-infected humans. It is not yet known whether physiological variation in APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F expression in CD4+ T lymphocytes is substantial enough to reduce vif-positive HIV-1 infectivity. In this study, we found that T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, a subtype of CD4+ lymphocytes, expressed greater amounts of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F than T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. This difference led to a difference in infectivity of HIV-1 produced from the two cell types, whether vif was expressed or not. These results demonstrate that physiological regulation of APOBEC3G does restrict vif-positive HIV-1, as well as vif-negative HIV-1. In addition, this study reveals biological factors regulating expression of these proteins that may be exploitable for new therapeutic or preventive strategies against HIV-1.

"Men who have sex with men (MSM) were found to be one of the high-risk populations for Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) infection. Accompanied by the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among MSM, invasive amebiasis caused by E. histolytica has been paid attention to as an opportunistic parasitic infection. However, the status of E. histolytica infection among MSM has been barely studied in mainland China.
Seroprevalance of E. histolytica was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on a cross-sectional study conducted in Beijing and Tianjin, China. Factors potentially associated with E. histolytica infection were identified by logistic regression analysis.
A total of 602 MSM were included in the study and the laboratory data on serostatus of E. histolytica were available for 599 of them (99.5%). 246 (41.1%) and 51 (8.5%) of the study participants were E. histolytica seropositive and HIV seropositive, respectively. Univariate analyses suggested preferred anal sex behaviors were associated with E. histolytica seropositivity. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, “only has receptive anal sex” (OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.22 3.37), “majority receptive anal sex” (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.13, 2.95), and “sadomasochistic behavior (SM)” (OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.04, 5.13) were found to be significantly associated with E. histolytica infection.
High seroprevalence of E. histolytica infection was observed among MSM from Beijing and Tianjin, China. Receptive anal sex behavior and SM were identified as potential predictors. Therefore, E. histolytica and HIV co-infection needs to be concerned among MSM due to their sharing the common risk behaviors.
","Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is a very common human gastrointestinal parasitic disease which affects 50 million people worldwide. Men who have sex with men (MSM) have already been found to be one of the high-risk populations with E. histolytica infection. Previous studies have reported an increased risk for E. histolytica infection and invasive amebiasis in HIV seropositive MSM. This pilot study aimed to investigate the serology of E. histolytica among MSM from mainland China. High prevalence of E. histolytica infection (41.1%, 246/599) was observed among the study population, receptive anal sex behavior and sadomasochistic behavior were found to be associated with the E. histolytica serostatus. Although HIV infection was not found to be associated with E. histolytica infection in this pilot study, studies from other countries had reported increased risks for E. histolytica infection and invasive amebiasis among HIV-positive MSM. Our findings suggest E. histolytica infection control needs to be concerned with respect to the increasing HIV prevalence among Chinese MSM population.

"Many enveloped viruses invade cells via endocytosis and use different environmental factors as triggers for virus-endosome fusion that delivers viral genome into cytosol. Intriguingly, dengue virus (DEN), the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus that infects up to 100 million people each year, fuses only in late endosomes, while activation of DEN protein fusogen glycoprotein E is triggered already at pH characteristic for early endosomes. Are there any cofactors that time DEN fusion to virion entry into late endosomes? Here we show that DEN utilizes bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a lipid specific to late endosomes, as a co-factor for its endosomal acidification-dependent fusion machinery. Effective virus fusion to plasma- and intracellular- membranes, as well as to protein-free liposomes, requires the target membrane to contain anionic lipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and phosphatidylserine. Anionic lipids act downstream of low-pH-dependent fusion stages and promote the advance from the earliest hemifusion intermediates to the fusion pore opening. To reach anionic lipid-enriched late endosomes, DEN travels through acidified early endosomes, but we found that low pH-dependent loss of fusogenic properties of DEN is relatively slow in the presence of anionic lipid-free target membranes. We propose that anionic lipid-dependence of DEN fusion machinery protects it against premature irreversible restructuring and inactivation and ensures viral fusion in late endosomes, where the virus encounters anionic lipids for the first time during entry. Currently there are neither vaccines nor effective therapies for DEN, and the essential role of the newly identified DEN-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate interactions in viral genome escape from the endosome suggests a novel target for drug design.
","Dengue virus infection is a growing public health problem with up to 100 million cases annually, and neither vaccines nor effective therapies are available. To search for the ways of preventing and treating dengue infections we need to better understand their molecular mechanisms. As with many other viruses, dengue virus enters cells by fusion between the viral membrane and the membrane of intracellular vesicles (endosomes). In this work we explored the fusion stage of dengue virus entry in different experimental systems ranging from virus fusion to artificial lipid membranes to fusion inside the cells. While earlier work on dengue virus entry has focused on viral protein that mediates fusion, we found that effective action of this protein requires specific lipid composition of the membrane the virus fuses to. In effect, this lipid dependence allows virus to control intracellular location of the fusion event and, thus, the place of its RNA release by exploiting cell-controlled differences between lipid compositions of different organelles the virus travels through. The essential role of the interactions between dengue virus and its lipid cofactors during viral entry suggests that these interactions may be targeted in drug design.

"Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are acute diseases associated with bleeding, organ failure, and shock. VHF may hardly be distinguished clinically from other diseases in the African hospital, including viral hepatitis. This study was conducted to determine if VHF and viral hepatitis contribute to hospital morbidity in the Central and Northern parts of Ghana.
From 2009 to 2011, blood samples of 258 patients with VHF symptoms were collected at 18 hospitals in Ashanti, Brong-Ahafo, Northern, Upper West, and Upper East regions. Patients were tested by PCR for Lassa, Rift Valley, Crimean-Congo, Ebola/Marburg, and yellow fever viruses; hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV), C (HCV), and E (HEV) viruses; and by ELISA for serological hepatitis markers. None of the patients tested positive for VHF. However, 21 (8.1%) showed anti-HBc IgM plus HBV DNA and/or HBsAg; 37 (14%) showed HBsAg and HBV DNA without anti-HBc IgM; 26 (10%) showed anti-HAV IgM and/or HAV RNA; and 20 (7.8%) were HCV RNA-positive. None was positive for HEV RNA or anti-HEV IgM plus IgG. Viral genotypes were determined as HAV-IB, HBV-A and E, and HCV-1, 2, and 4.
VHFs do not cause significant hospital morbidity in the study area. However, the incidence of acute hepatitis A and B, and hepatitis B and C with active virus replication is high. These infections may mimic VHF and need to be considered if VHF is suspected. The data may help decision makers to allocate resources and focus surveillance systems on the diseases of relevance in Ghana.
","Ghana is endemic for yellow fever and lies between two Lassa fever endemic areas — Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali in the West, and Nigeria in the East. Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been documented in the neighboring Cote d'Ivoire. Thus, it is plausible that the latter VHFs also occur in Ghana, and there have been rumors of cases, which present like VHF in the north of the country. Our study aimed at verifying or disproving this suspicion. At 18 hospital-based study sites in the Central and Northern part of the country, samples from 258 patients with VHF symptoms were collected and tested for various VHF by PCR. As viral hepatitis is an important differential diagnosis of yellow fever, we also tested for several serological and molecular hepatitis markers. Rather surprisingly, VHFs were not detected, indicating that, even if they are endemic in the North of Ghana, they do not significantly contribute to hospital morbidity. However, a large fraction of patients showed markers of acute hepatitis A, and active hepatitis B and C. Children were mainly affected by hepatitis A, while adults were affected by hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis A and B are vaccine-preventable, and chronic hepatitis B and C are treatable diseases. Further efforts are needed to reduce the burden of these diseases in Ghana.

"The emerging structural information about allosteric kinase complexes and the growing number of allosteric inhibitors call for a systematic strategy to delineate and classify mechanisms of allosteric regulation and long-range communication that control kinase activity. In this work, we have investigated mechanistic aspects of long-range communications in ABL and EGFR kinases based on the results of multiscale simulations of regulatory complexes and computational modeling of signal propagation in proteins. These approaches have been systematically employed to elucidate organizing molecular principles of allosteric signaling in the ABL and EGFR multi-domain regulatory complexes and analyze allosteric signatures of the gate-keeper cancer mutations. We have presented evidence that mechanisms of allosteric activation may have universally evolved in the ABL and EGFR regulatory complexes as a product of a functional cross-talk between the organizing αF-helix and conformationally adaptive αI-helix and αC-helix. These structural elements form a dynamic network of efficiently communicated clusters that may control the long-range interdomain coupling and allosteric activation. The results of this study have unveiled a unifying effect of the gate-keeper cancer mutations as catalysts of kinase activation, leading to the enhanced long-range communication among allosterically coupled segments and stabilization of the active kinase form. The results of this study can reconcile recent experimental studies of allosteric inhibition and long-range cooperativity between binding sites in protein kinases. The presented study offers a novel molecular insight into mechanistic aspects of allosteric kinase signaling and provides a quantitative picture of activation mechanisms in protein kinases at the atomic level.
","Despite recent progress in computational and experimental studies of dynamic regulation in protein kinases, a mechanistic understanding of long-range communication and mechanisms of mutation-induced signaling controlling kinase activity remains largely qualitative. In this study, we have performed a systematic modeling and analysis of allosteric activation in ABL and EGFR kinases at the increasing level of complexity - from catalytic domain to multi-domain regulatory complexes. The results of this study have revealed organizing structural and mechanistic principles of allosteric signaling in protein kinases. Although activation mechanisms in ABL and EGFR kinases have evolved through acquisition of structurally different regulatory complexes, we have found that long-range interdomain communication between common functional segments (αF-helix and αC-helix) may be important for allosteric activation. The results of study have revealed molecular signatures of activating cancer mutations and have shed the light on general mechanistic aspects of mutation-induced signaling in protein kinases. An advanced understanding and further characterization of molecular signatures of kinase mutations may aid in a better rationalization of mutational effects on clinical outcomes and facilitate molecular-based therapeutic strategies to combat kinase mutation-dependent tumorigenesis.

"The visceral endoderm (VE) is a simple epithelium that forms the outer layer of the egg-cylinder stage mouse embryo. The anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), a specialised subset of VE cells, is responsible for specifying anterior pattern. AVE cells show a stereotypic migratory behaviour within the VE, which is responsible for correctly orientating the anterior-posterior axis. The epithelial integrity of the VE is maintained during the course of AVE migration, which takes place by intercalation of AVE and other VE cells. Though a continuous epithelial sheet, the VE is characterised by two regions of dramatically different behaviour, one showing robust cell movement and intercalation (in which the AVE migrates) and one that is static, with relatively little cell movement and mixing. Little is known about the cellular rearrangements that accommodate and influence the sustained directional movement of subsets of cells (such as the AVE) within epithelia like the VE. This study uses an interdisciplinary approach to further our understanding of cell movement in epithelia. Using both wild-type embryos as well as mutants in which AVE migration is abnormal or arrested, we show that AVE migration is specifically linked to changes in cell packing in the VE and an increase in multi-cellular rosette arrangements (five or more cells meeting at a point). To probe the role of rosettes during AVE migration, we develop a mathematical model of cell movement in the VE. To do this, we use a vertex-based model, implemented on an ellipsoidal surface to represent a realistic geometry for the mouse egg-cylinder. The potential for rosette formation is included, along with various junctional rearrangements. Simulations suggest that while rosettes are not essential for AVE migration, they are crucial for the orderliness of this migration observed in embryos. Our simulations are similar to results from transgenic embryos in which Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signalling is disrupted. Such embryos have significantly reduced rosette numbers, altered epithelial packing, and show abnormalities in AVE migration. Our results show that the formation of multi-cellular rosettes in the mouse VE is dependent on normal PCP signalling. Taken together, our model and experimental observations suggest that rosettes in the VE epithelium do not form passively in response to AVE migration. Instead, they are a PCP-dependent arrangement of cells that acts to buffer the disequilibrium in cell packing generated in the VE by AVE migration, enabling AVE cells to migrate in an orderly manner.
","The mouse visceral endoderm (VE) is a simple epithelium in the egg cylinder stage mouse embryo. Many functions associated with epithelia require them to undergo extensive remodelling through changes in the shape and relative positions of constituent cells, a process about which we understand relatively little. The anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) is a specialized group of cells in the simple epithelium of the VE, and their stereotypic migratory behaviour is essential for establishing the orientation of the anterior-posterior axis in the early mouse embryo. We show that AVE migration is linked to changes in cell packing in the VE and an increase in “rosettes,” which are striking collections of five or more cells meeting at a central point. To probe the role of rosettes during AVE migration, we have developed a mathematical model of cell movement in the VE. Simulations suggest that rosettes are not essential for AVE migration, but are crucial for the orderliness of this migration. We also explored the role of Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signalling, which is known to coordinate cell polarization and rearrangement in many different tissues. We find that mutants in which PCP signalling is disrupted have fewer rosettes, altered epithelial packing, and abnormal AVE migration. We suggest that rosettes in the mouse VE are a PCP-dependent arrangement of cells that act to buffer the disturbances in cell packing generated by AVE migration, thereby enabling AVE cells to migrate in an orderly manner.

"There continue to be increasing occurrences of both atomistic structure models in the PDB (possibly reconstructed from X-ray diffraction or NMR data), and 3D reconstructed cryo-electron microscopy (3D EM) maps (albeit at coarser resolution) of the same or homologous molecule or molecular assembly, deposited in the EMDB. To obtain the best possible structural model of the molecule at the best achievable resolution, and without any missing gaps, one typically aligns (match and fits) the atomistic structure model with the 3D EM map. We discuss a new algorithm and generalized framework, named PF2 fit (Polar Fast Fourier Fitting) for the best possible structural alignment of atomistic structures with 3D EM. While PF2 fit enables only a rigid, six dimensional (6D) alignment method, it augments prior work on 6D X-ray structure and 3D EM alignment in multiple ways:
Scoring. PF2 fit includes a new scoring scheme that, in addition to rewarding overlaps between the volumes occupied by the atomistic structure and 3D EM map, rewards overlaps between the volumes complementary to them. We quantitatively demonstrate how this new complementary scoring scheme improves upon existing approaches. PF2 fit also includes two scoring functions, the non-uniform exterior penalty and the skeleton-secondary structure score, and implements the scattering potential score as an alternative to traditional Gaussian blurring.
Search. PF2 fit utilizes a fast polar Fourier search scheme, whose main advantage is the ability to search over uniformly and adaptively sampled subsets of the space of rigid-body motions. PF2 fit also implements a new reranking search and scoring methodology that considerably improves alignment metrics in results obtained from the initial search.
","In recent years, advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction have made it possible to determine the structures of molecular complexes, to sub-nanometer resolutions. These reconstructed 3D cryoEM maps provide a unique challenge, since the resolutions are often sufficient to resolve a subset of the secondary structural features (e.g., long α-helices), but not high enough to unambiguously identify others (e.g., short α-helices, β-sheets, α-helix pitch, or overall connectivity of proteins). Various types of hierarchical structure refinement models of the data, including the atomistic model match and fitting, which is the subject of this paper are crucial in helping derive a more complete understanding of the structure and function relationships of biological complexes. Our protocol offers several advantages over existing fitting techniques. We introduce three new scoring terms to evaluate the quality of fitting, and the optimization of these functions lead to better predictions than existing tools like ADP-EM and Colores. Furthermore, we have adopted a non-uniform FFT-based search which is not only faster than regular FFT, but it also enables one to selectively perform more refined searches in localized regions, which is specially useful when fitting a small molecular component into a larger symmetric or asymmetric macromolecular structure.

"Large experimental efforts are characterizing the regulatory genome, yet we are still missing a systematic definition of functional and silent genetic variants in non-coding regions. Here, we integrated DNaseI footprinting data with sequence-based transcription factor (TF) motif models to predict the impact of a genetic variant on TF binding across 153 tissues and 1,372 TF motifs. Each annotation we derived is specific for a cell-type condition or assay and is locally motif-driven. We found 5.8 million genetic variants in footprints, 66% of which are predicted by our model to affect TF binding. Comprehensive examination using allele-specific hypersensitivity (ASH) reveals that only the latter group consistently shows evidence for ASH (3,217 SNPs at 20% FDR), suggesting that most (97%) genetic variants in footprinted regulatory regions are indeed silent. Combining this information with GWAS data reveals that our annotation helps in computationally fine-mapping 86 SNPs in GWAS hit regions with at least a 2-fold increase in the posterior odds of picking the causal SNP. The rich meta information provided by the tissue-specificity and the identity of the putative TF binding site being affected also helps in identifying the underlying mechanism supporting the association. As an example, the enrichment for LDL level-associated SNPs is 9.1-fold higher among SNPs predicted to affect HNF4 binding sites than in a background model already including tissue-specific annotation.
","A large fraction of genetic variants that have been associated with complex traits are found outside of protein coding genes and likely affect gene regulation. Many experimental efforts have been dedicated to mapping regulatory regions in the genome but there are not many systematic methods that integrate functional data and regulatory sequences to predict the potential effect of any genetic variant on any given tissue and motif. Here we present a tissue and factor specific annotation that provides a predicted functional effect for both common and rare genetic variants. These predictions, certain of which are validated experimentally, show that the majority of genetic variants in gene regulatory regions are actually silent. Annotating those that are not silent allows us to investigate the molecular basis for the genetic architecture of many common traits and also to study the evolutionary properties that different types of regulatory sequences have across tissues or transcription factors. Overall, our study supports the concept that polygenic variation in binding sites for distinct classes of transcription factors has been a major target of evolutionary forces contributing to disease risk and complex trait variation in humans.

"Schistosomiasis in one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases, affecting millions of people and animals in developing countries. Amongst the human-infective species S. haematobium is one of the most widespread causing urogenital schistosomiasis, a major human health problem across Africa, however in terms of research this human pathogen has been severely neglected.
To elucidate the genetic diversity of Schistosoma haematobium, a DNA ‘barcoding’ study was performed on parasite material collected from 41 localities representing 18 countries across Africa and the Indian Ocean Islands. Surprisingly low sequence variation was found within the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1) and the NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 1 snad1). The 61 haplotypes found within 1978 individual samples split into two distinct groups; one (Group 1) that is predominately made up of parasites from the African mainland and the other (Group 2) that is made up of samples exclusively from the Indian Ocean Islands and the neighbouring African coastal regions. Within Group 1 there was a dominance of one particular haplotype (H1) representing 1574 (80%) of the samples analyzed. Population genetic diversity increased in samples collected from the East African coastal regions and the data suggest that there has been movement of parasites between these areas and the Indian Ocean Islands.
The high occurrence of the haplotype (H1) suggests that at some point in the recent evolutionary history of S. haematobium in Africa the population may have passed through a genetic ‘bottleneck’ followed by a population expansion. This study provides novel and extremely interesting insights into the population genetics of S. haematobium on a large geographic scale, which may have consequence for control and monitoring of urogenital schistosomiasis.
","Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Species that infect humans are prevalent in developing countries, having a major impact on public health and well-being as well as an impediment to socioeconomic development. More people are infected with Schistosoma haematobium than with all the other schistosome species combined, however mainly due to the inability to maintain S. haematobium in the laboratory system empirical studies on this parasite are minimal. The genetic variation of this Schistosoma species on a wide geographical scale has never been investigated. In this study, we have used a DNA ?barcoding? approach to document the genetic variation and population structure of S. haematobium sampled from 18 countries across Africa and the Indian ocean Islands. The study revealed a distinct genetic separation of S. haematobium from the Indian Ocean Islands and the closely neighbouring coastal regions from S. haematobium found throughout the African mainland, the latter of which exhibited extremely low levels of mitochondrial diversity within and between populations of parasites sampled. The data from this study provides a novel insight into the population genetics of S. haematobium and will have an impact on future research strategies.

"The Rhipicephalus microplus tick is a notorious blood-feeding ectoparasite of livestock, especially cattle, responsible for massive losses in animal production. It is the main vector for transmission of pathogenic bacteria and parasites, including Babesia bovis, an intraerythrocytic apicomplexan protozoan parasite responsible for bovine Babesiosis. This study describes the development and testing of a live B. bovis vaccine expressing the protective tick antigen glutathione-S-transferase from Haemaphysalis longicornis (HlGST). The B. bovis S74-T3B parasites were electroporated with a plasmid containing the bidirectional Ef-1α (elongation factor 1 alpha) promoter of B. bovis controlling expression of two independent genes, the selectable marker GFP-BSD (green fluorescent protein–blasticidin deaminase), and HlGST fused to the MSA-1 (merozoite surface antigen 1) signal peptide from B. bovis. Electroporation followed by blasticidin selection resulted in the emergence of a mixed B. bovis transfected line (termed HlGST) in in vitro cultures, containing parasites with distinct patterns of insertion of both exogenous genes, either in or outside the Ef-1α locus. A B. bovis clonal line termed HlGST-Cln expressing intracellular GFP and HlGST in the surface of merozoites was then derived from the mixed parasite line HlGST using a fluorescent activated cell sorter. Two independent calf immunization trials were performed via intravenous inoculation of the HlGST-Cln and a previously described control consisting of an irrelevant transfected clonal line of B. bovis designated GFP-Cln. The control GFP-Cln line contains a copy of the GFP-BSD gene inserted into the Ef-1α locus of B. bovis in an identical fashion as the HIGST-Cln parasites. All animals inoculated with the HlGST-Cln and GFP-Cln transfected parasites developed mild babesiosis. Tick egg fertility and fully engorged female tick weight was reduced significantly in R. microplus feeding on HlGST-Cln-immunized calves. Collectively, these data show the efficacy of a transfected HlGST-Cln B. bovis parasite to induce detectable anti-glutathione-S-transferase antibodies and a reduction in tick size and fecundity of R. microplus feeding in experimentally inoculated animals.
","The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus is a hematophagous ectoparasite, responsible for the transmission of lethal parasites such as Babesia sp, limiting cattle production in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. There is an urgent emerging need for improved methods of control for these currently neglected tick and tick borne diseases. It is hypothesized that a dual attenuated-live vector vaccine containing a stably transfected tick antigen elicits protective immune responses against the parasite and the tick vector in vaccinated cattle. Live Babesia vaccines based on attenuated parasites are the only effective method available for preventing acute babesiosis. On the other hand, glutathione-S-transferase from Haemaphysalis longicornis (HlGST) is a known effective antigen against Rhipicephalus microplus, the most common vector for B. bovis. This study describes the development and testing of a transfected, B. bovis vaccine expressing HlGST against the tick R. microplus. A B. bovis clonal line designated HlGST-Cln expressing HlGST and GFP/BSD, and separately a control transfected B. bovis clonal line expressing only GFP/BSD was used to vaccinate calves in two independent experiments. All immunized calves developed mild babesiosis, and only calves immunized with the HlGST-Cln parasite line generated anti-HlGST antibodies. Tick egg fertility and fully engorged female tick weight were reduced significantly in R. microplus feeding on HlGST-Cln-vaccinated calves. Taken together, these data demonstrates the ability of transfected B. bovis to elicit antibodies against a heterologous tick antigen in cattle and to induce partial protection in the vaccinated animals against the cattle tick for the first time, representing a step toward the goal to produce a live vector anti-tick vaccine.

"Treatment of human cells with Type 1 interferons restricts HIV replication. Here we report that the tripartite motif protein TRIM22 is a key mediator. We used transcriptional profiling to identify cellular genes that were induced by interferon treatment and identified TRIM22 as one of the most strongly up-regulated genes. We confirmed, as in previous studies, that TRIM22 over-expression inhibited HIV replication. To assess the role of TRIM22 expressed under natural inducing conditions, we compared the effects of interferon in cells depleted for TRIM22 using RNAi and found that HIV particle release was significantly increased in the knockdown, implying that TRIM22 acts as a natural antiviral effector. Further studies showed that TRIM22 inhibited budding of virus-like particles containing Gag only, indicating that Gag was the target of TRIM22. TRIM22 did not block the release of MLV or EIAV Gag particles. Inhibition was associated with diffuse cytoplasmic staining of HIV Gag rather than accumulation at the plasma membrane, suggesting TRIM22 disrupts proper trafficking. Mutational analyses of TRIM22 showed that the catalytic amino acids Cys15 and Cys18 of the RING domain are required for TRIM22 antiviral activity. These data disclose a pathway by which Type 1 interferons obstruct HIV replication.
","Interferons are produced by cells in response to challenge by foreign pathogens such as viruses. The molecular mechanisms by which Type I interferons (e.g., IFNβ) inhibit the replication of HIV-1 are not fully clarified. We identified a gene called TRIM22 that belongs to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family that was strongly induced by IFNβ. Using RNA interference to reduce the expression of TRIM22, we showed that TRIM22 is a key mediator of the IFNβ response when expressed at natural levels. We demonstrate that TRIM22 blocks the intracellular trafficking of the viral structural protein Gag to the surface of the cell, and that the antiviral activity of TRIM22 is dependent on two cysteine residues (Cys15 and Cys18) that are critical for the E3 ligase activity of RING-containing proteins. This report describes a mechanism by which Type I interferons block HIV-1 replication.

"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype often cause severe pneumonia and multiple organ failure in humans, with reported case fatality rates of more than 60%. To develop a clinical antibody therapy, we generated a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (MAb) ch61 that showed strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans and evaluated its protective potential in mouse and nonhuman primate models of H5N1 HPAI virus infections. Passive immunization with MAb ch61 one day before or after challenge with a lethal dose of the virus completely protected mice, and partial protection was achieved when mice were treated 3 days after the challenge. In a cynomolgus macaque model, reduced viral loads and partial protection against lethal infection were observed in macaques treated with MAb ch61 intravenously one and three days after challenge. Protective effects were also noted in macaques under immunosuppression. Though mutant viruses escaping from neutralization by MAb ch61 were recovered from macaques treated with this MAb alone, combined treatment with MAb ch61 and peramivir reduced the emergence of escape mutants. Our results indicate that antibody therapy might be beneficial in reducing viral loads and delaying disease progression during H5N1 HPAI virus infection in clinical cases and combined treatment with other antiviral compounds should improve the protective effects of antibody therapy against H5N1 HPAI virus infection.
","The H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been circulating in poultry in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa since its first appearance in southern China in 1996. This virus occasionally infects humans with a high case mortality rate and poses a significant pandemic threat. Since neutralizing antibodies generally play a major role in protective immunity against influenza viruses, antibody therapy is a potential option for preventing highly lethal infection with the H5N1 virus in humans. Here we evaluated the protective potential of a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody with strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 viruses in mouse and nonhuman primate models of lethal H5N1 virus infection. The therapeutic use of the neutralizing antibody resulted in reduced viral loads and improved survival in animals infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. It was noted that the protective effects were more prominent in immunosuppressed macaques, which might provide a model of protection against severe clinical disease in immunocompromised patients. In addition, combination therapy together with an antiviral drug reduced the selection of escape mutants. Collectively, this study suggests that antibody therapy may have beneficial effects in clinical cases of H5N1 HPAI virus infection in humans.

"The Wolbachia strategy aims to manipulate mosquito populations to make them incapable of transmitting dengue viruses between people. To test its efficacy, this strategy requires field trials. Public consultation and engagement are recognized as critical to the future success of these programs, but questions remain regarding how to proceed. This paper reports on a case study where social research was used to design a community engagement framework for a new dengue control method, at a potential release site in central Vietnam.
The approach described here, draws on an anthropological methodology and uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to design an engagement framework tailored to the concerns, expectations, and socio-political setting of a potential trial release site for Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The process, research activities, key findings and how these were responded to are described. Safety of the method to humans and the environment was the most common and significant concern, followed by efficacy and impact on local lives. Residents expected to be fully informed and engaged about the science, the project, its safety, the release and who would be responsible should something go wrong. They desired a level of engagement that included regular updates and authorization from government and at least one member of every household at the release site.
Results demonstrate that social research can provide important and reliable insights into public concerns and expectations at a potential release site, as well as guidance on how these might be addressed. Findings support the argument that using research to develop more targeted, engagement frameworks can lead to more sensitive, thorough, culturally comprehensible and therefore ethical consultation processes. This approach has now been used successfully to seek public input and eventually support for releases Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, in two different international settings - Australia and Vietnam.
","In recent years, a number of new strategies using novel technologies for the control of dengue fever control have emerged. These strategies are notably different from their predecessors and not without controversy. Many also require open release field trials to test their efficacy. Public consultation and engagement are recognized as critical to the future success of these programs, but questions remain regarding how to proceed. In this paper we describe an approach to public engagement that uses social research to design an engagement framework and communication materials tailored to the concerns, expectations, and socio-political setting of potential trial release sites. This approach was developed and implemented in Australia (2008–2010) where the first publicly supported field trials occurred January 2011. We report here on the implementation of this approach in Vietnam (2009–2010) where the second release will occur in 2014. This paper describes the process, research activities, outcomes and key findings from the Vietnamese field site. It highlights key public concerns and expectations about engagement and authorization and shows how these were used to develop a more targeted, culturally appropriate and comprehensible engagement framework and communication materials. The paper demonstrates the viability of this approach to community engagement for new dengue control strategies, in a ‘developing’ country context.

"Endocytic sorting is achieved through the formation of morphologically and functionally distinct sub-domains within early endosomes. Cargoes destined for recycling are sorted to and transported through newly-formed tubular membranes, but the processes that regulate membrane tubulation are poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel Caenorhabditis elegans Cdc50 family protein, CHAT-1, which acts as the chaperone of the TAT-1 P4-ATPase to regulate membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) asymmetry and endocytic transport. In chat-1 and tat-1 mutants, the endocytic sorting process is disrupted, leading to defects in both cargo recycling and degradation. TAT-1 and CHAT-1 colocalize to the tubular domain of the early endosome, the tubular endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), and the recycling endosome where PS is enriched on the cytosolic surface. Loss of tat-1 and chat-1 function disrupts membrane PS asymmetry and abrogates the tubular membrane structure. Our data suggest that CHAT-1 and TAT-1 maintain membrane phosphatidylserine asymmetry, thus promoting membrane tubulation and regulating endocytic sorting and recycling.
","The process by which cells take up nutrients and other large molecules from the extracellular environment is known as endocytosis. At the cell surface, external molecules become enclosed in membrane spheres called endosomes. Early endosomes serve as a sorting station, directing the contents (cargo molecules) to the correct compartment within the cell. This is thought to be achieved by the formation of membrane structures with distinct shape and function. For example, cargoes destined for recycling and degradation are processed through tubular membrane structures and big vesicular compartments, respectively. However, it is poorly understood how early endosome membranes are shaped into different structures. Here we show that two proteins, CHAT-1 and TAT-1, regulate membrane structure and are important for normal endocytic transport in the nematode worm C. elegans. TAT-1 and CHAT-1 are found in tubular membrane structures along the sorting and recycling pathway, where they enrich the outer membrane layer with a lipid called phosphatidylserine (PS) and probably change the membrane curvature. Loss of tat-1 and chat-1 function disrupts the asymmetric distribution of PS, abolishes tubular membrane structures, and abrogates endocytic sorting/recycling. Our data support a role of TAT-1/CHAT-1–regulated membrane PS asymmetry in promoting membrane tubulation for endocytic cargo sorting and recycling.

"While the exopolysaccharide component of the biofilm matrix has been intensively studied, much less is known about matrix-associated proteins. To better understand the role of these proteins, we undertook a proteomic analysis of the V. cholerae biofilm matrix. Here we show that the two matrix-associated proteins, Bap1 and RbmA, perform distinct roles in the biofilm matrix. RbmA strengthens intercellular attachments. In contrast, Bap1 is concentrated on surfaces where it serves to anchor the biofilm and recruit cells not yet committed to the sessile lifestyle. This is the first example of a biofilm-derived, communally synthesized conditioning film that stabilizes the association of multilayer biofilms with a surface and facilitates recruitment of planktonic bystanders to the substratum. These studies define a novel paradigm for spatial and functional differentiation of proteins in the biofilm matrix and provide evidence for bacterial cooperation in maintenance and expansion of the multilayer biofilm.
","The bacterial multilayer biofilm consists of matrix-enclosed cells attached to each other to form large aggregates. The base of these aggregates may be attached to a living or non-living surface. The biofilm matrix most often contains at least one exopolysaccharide component and may also contain protein and DNA. While much is known about the exopolysaccharide component of the Gram-negative biofilm matrix, little is known about the function of biofilm matrix proteins. We hypothesized that the biofilm matrix might harbor proteins with diverse functions. Therefore, we undertook the first proteomic analysis of the biofilm matrix of a Gram-negative bacterium, V. cholerae. We subsequently focused on Bap1 and RbmA, two proteins that are abundant in the biofilm matrix. RbmA, which strengthens intercellular interactions, was found to be evenly distributed in the biofilm. In contrast, communally synthesized Bap1 was concentrated at the biofilm-surface interface and stabilized the association of the multilayer biofilm with the surface. Furthermore, the addition of purified Bap1 increased attachment of free-swimming cells to a surface. These studies provide evidence for spatial and functional differentiation of proteins in the biofilm matrix and suggest bacterial cooperation in stabilization of multilayer biofilm surface association and recruitment of new members.

"The VL elimination strategy requires cost-effective tools for case detection and management. This intervention study tests the yield, feasibility and cost of 4 different active case detection (ACD) strategies (camp, index case, incentive and blanket approach) in VL endemic districts of India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
First, VL screening (fever more than 14 days, splenomegaly, rK39 test) was performed in camps. This was followed by house to house screening (blanket approach). An analysis of secondary VL cases in the neighborhood of index cases was simulated (index case approach). A second screening round was repeated 4–6 months later. In another sub-district in India and Nepal, health workers received incentives for detecting new VL cases over a 4 month period (incentive approach). This was followed by house screening for undetected cases. A total of 28 new VL cases were identified by blanket approach in the 1st screening round, and used as ACD gold standard. Of these, the camp approach identified 22 (sensitivity 78.6%), index case approach identified 12 (sensitivity – 42.9%), and incentive approach identified 23 new VL cases out of 29 cases detected by the house screening (sensitivity – 79.3%). The effort required to detect a new VL case varied (blanket approach – 1092 households, incentive approach – 978 households; index case approach – 788 households had to be screened). The cost per new case detected varied (camp approach $21 – $661; index case approach $149 – $200; incentive based approach $50 – $543; blanket screening $112 – $629). The 2nd screening round yielded 20 new VL cases. Sixty and nine new PKDL cases were detected in the first and second round respectively.
ACD in the VL elimination campaign has a high yield of new cases at programme costs which vary according to the screening method chosen. Countries need the right mix of approaches according to the epidemiological profile, affordability and organizational feasibility.
","For the elimination of any infectious disease (i.e., reduction of the burden of a serious public health problem to a minor problem which can be managed by the general health services) the right mix of public health tools has to be identified for the early detection and successful treatment of new cases as well as effective vector control (in the case of vector borne diseases) at affordable costs. The paper provides a powerful example of evidence building for cost-effective early case detection in the visceral leishmaniasis elimination initiative of Bangladesh, India and Nepal. It compares the camp approach (mobile teams testing in chronic fever camps for spleen enlargement and rapid diagnostic tests) with the index case approach (screening for new cases in the neighbourhood of reported visceral leishmaniasis patients) and the incentive based approach (where basic health workers receive an allowance for detecting a new case) using subsequent house-to-house screening for the identification of the real number of un-detected cases. By applying a mix of different study methods and an itinerate research process to identify the most effective, feasible and affordable case detection method, under different environmental conditions, recommendations could be developed which help governments in shaping their visceral leishmaniasis elimination strategy.

"Recent analyses of human genome sequences have given rise to impressive advances in identifying non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs). By contrast, the annotation of nsSNPs and their links to diseases are progressing at a much slower pace. Many of the current approaches to analysing disease-associated nsSNPs use primarily sequence and evolutionary information, while structural information is relatively less exploited. In order to explore the potential of such information, we developed a structure-based approach, Bongo (Bonds ON Graph), to predict structural effects of nsSNPs. Bongo considers protein structures as residue–residue interaction networks and applies graph theoretical measures to identify the residues that are critical for maintaining structural stability by assessing the consequences on the interaction network of single point mutations. Our results show that Bongo is able to identify mutations that cause both local and global structural effects, with a remarkably low false positive rate. Application of the Bongo method to the prediction of 506 disease-associated nsSNPs resulted in a performance (positive predictive value, PPV, 78.5%) similar to that of PolyPhen (PPV, 77.2%) and PANTHER (PPV, 72.2%). As the Bongo method is solely structure-based, our results indicate that the structural changes resulting from nsSNPs are closely associated to their pathological consequences.
","Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are single base differences between individual genomes that lead to amino acid changes in protein sequences. They may influence an individual's susceptibility to disease or response to drugs through their impacts on a protein's structure and hence cause functional changes. In this paper, we present a new methodology to estimate the impact of nsSNPs on disease susceptibility. This is made possible by characterising the protein structure and the change of structural stability due to nsSNPs. We show that our computer program Bongo, which describes protein structures as interlinked amino acids, can identify conformational changes resulting from nsSNPs that are closely associated with pathological consequences. Bongo requires only structural information to analyze nsSNPs and thus is complementary to methods that use evolutionary information. Bongo helps us investigate the suggestion that most disease-causing mutations disturb structural features of proteins, thus affecting their stability. We anticipate that making Bongo available to the community will facilitate a better understanding of disease-associated nsSNPs and thus benefit personal medicine in the future.

"Currently, no dengue NS1 detection kit has regulatory approval for the diagnosis of acute dengue fever. Here we report the sensitivity and specificity of the InBios DEN Detect NS1 ELISA using a panel of well characterized human acute fever serum specimens.
The InBios DENV Detect NS1 ELISA was tested using a panel composed of 334 serum specimens collected from acute febrile patients seeking care in a Bangkok hospital in 2010 and 2011. Of these patients, 314 were found to have acute dengue by either RT-PCR and/or anti-dengue IgM/IgG ELISA. Alongside the InBios NS1 ELISA kit, we compared the performance characteristics of the BioRad Platelia NS1 antigen kit. The InBios NS1 ELISA Ag kit had a higher overall sensitivity (86% vs 72.8%) but equal specificity (100%) compared to the BioRad Platelia kit. The serological status of the patient significantly influenced the outcome. In primary infections, the InBios NS1 kit demonstrated a higher sensitivity (98.8%) than in secondary infections (83.5%). We found significant variation in the sensitivity of the InBios NS1 ELISA kit depending on the serotype of the dengue virus and also found decreasing sensitivity the longer after the onset of illness, showing 100% sensitivity early during illness, but dropping below 50% by Day 7.
The InBios NS1 ELISA kit demonstrated high accuracy when compared to the initial clinical diagnosis with greater than 85% agreement when patients were clinically diagnosed with dengue illness. Results presented here suggest the accurate detection of circulating dengue NS1 by the InBios DENV Detect NS1 ELISA can provide clinicians with a useful tool for diagnosis of early dengue infections.
","Infections by the mosquito-transmitted dengue virus continue to increase, threatening the health of people in over a hundred countries worldwide. The lack of effective mosquito control, licensed dengue vaccines or specific therapeutics to treat dengue infections presents challenges to reduce the burden of this disease. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of dengue infections is critical for the reduction of patients' morbidity and mortality. We present data that support the use of the InBios DENV Detect NS1 ELISA for the detection of dengue NS1 in patient serum. The InBios NS1 ELISA kit was tested against sera collected from acute fever patients seeking medical care in a Bangkok, Thailand hospital during 2010 and 2011. The data demonstrate the InBios DENV Detect NS1 ELISA accurately detects circulating dengue NS1 in the tested specimens, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of the NS1 ELISA kits was found to vary depending on the serological status of the patient (primary versus secondary dengue infection), time of specimen collection and dengue serotype. Further, the performance characteristics of the InBios DENV Detect NS1 ELISA were found to meet and exceed those of the commonly used Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag kit.

"Chromatoid bodies (CBs) are spermiogenesis-specific organelles of largely unknown function. CBs harbor various RNA species, RNA-associated proteins and proteins of the tudor domain family like TDRD6, which is required for a proper CB architecture. Proteome analysis of purified CBs revealed components of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) machinery including UPF1. TDRD6 is essential for UPF1 localization to CBs, for UPF1-UPF2 and UPF1-MVH interactions. Upon removal of TDRD6, the association of several mRNAs with UPF1 and UPF2 is disturbed, and the long 3’ UTR-stimulated but not the downstream exon-exon junction triggered pathway of NMD is impaired. Reduced association of the long 3’ UTR mRNAs with UPF1 and UPF2 correlates with increased stability and enhanced translational activity. Thus, we identified TDRD6 within CBs as required for mRNA degradation, specifically the extended 3’ UTR-triggered NMD pathway, and provide evidence for the requirement of NMD in spermiogenesis. This function depends on TDRD6-promoted assembly of mRNA and decay enzymes in CBs.
","Tudor-domain containing protein 6 (TDRD6) is a central component of the chromatoid body (CB) in male germ cells. Chromatoid bodies, which are present in spermatids, contain RNA and protein, are not enclosed by membranes, and typically reside close to the nucleus. Without TDRD6, a much distorted CB structure is observed, and this work asked for the functional contribution of TDRD6 to spermatids. We found that TDRD6 is required for localization of an RNA degradation machinery to the CB. This so-called nonsense mediated decay (NMD) machinery, known from somatic cells, destroys mRNAs that feature premature stop codons. Absence of TDRD6 significantly impairs one specific mechanism of NMD, which depends on long 3’ untranslated regions of the transcripts. Thus, the CB component TDRD6 acts in the assembly of the NMD machinery in the CB.

"Organ growth is controlled by patterning signals that operate locally (e.g., Wingless/Ints [Wnts], Bone Morphogenetic Proteins [BMPs], and Hedgehogs [Hhs]) and scaled by nutrient-dependent signals that act systemically (e.g., Insulin-like peptides [ILPs] transduced by the Target of Rapamycin [TOR] pathway). How cells integrate these distinct inputs to generate organs of the appropriate size and shape is largely unknown. The transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki, a YES-Associated Protein, or YAP) acts downstream of patterning morphogens and other tissue-intrinsic signals to promote organ growth. Yki activity is regulated primarily by the Warts/Hippo (Wts/Hpo) tumour suppressor pathway, which impedes nuclear access of Yki by a cytoplasmic tethering mechanism. Here, we show that the TOR pathway regulates Yki by a separate and novel mechanism in the Drosophila wing. Instead of controlling Yki nuclear access, TOR signaling governs Yki action after it reaches the nucleus by allowing it to gain access to its target genes. When TOR activity is inhibited, Yki accumulates in the nucleus but is sequestered from its normal growth-promoting target genes—a phenomenon we term “nuclear seclusion.” Hence, we posit that in addition to its well-known role in stimulating cellular metabolism in response to nutrients, TOR also promotes wing growth by liberating Yki from nuclear seclusion, a parallel pathway that we propose contributes to the scaling of wing size with nutrient availability.
","What mechanisms control the sizes of animal organs? It is known that organ growth is the product of two systems: an intrinsic system that coordinates cell proliferation with the specification of cell fate (patterning), and an extrinsic system that synchronizes growth with nutrient levels. Developing organs integrate these two inputs to ensure that properly proportioned structures develop which are of the right scale to match overall body size. However, the mechanisms used to integrate these distinct growth control systems have remained largely mysterious. In this study, we have addressed how intrinsic and extrinsic systems combine to drive growth of the Drosophila wing. Focusing on the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway—a major, nutrient-dependent regulator of organ growth—and Yorkie—the transcriptional activator downstream of the Hippo pathway and a key, organ-intrinsic growth regulator—we have identified a circuit in which TOR activity limits Yorkie’s capacity to promote wing growth, in part through a novel mode of transcription factor regulation that we term “nuclear seclusion.” We find that inhibiting TOR leads to the retention of Yorkie in the nucleus but diminishes its transcriptional activity by diverting it away from target genes. We posit that subjugating Yorkie in this way contributes to how fluctuations in TOR activity scale wing size according to nutrient levels.

"We report in this work that Leptospira strains, virulent L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, attenuated L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni and saprophytic L. biflexa serovar Patoc are capable of binding fibrinogen (Fg). The interaction of leptospires with Fg inhibits thrombin- induced fibrin clot formation that may affect the haemostatic equilibrium. Additionally, we show that plasminogen (PLG)/plasmin (PLA) generation on the surface of Leptospira causes degradation of human Fg. The data suggest that PLA-coated leptospires were capable to employ their proteolytic activity to decrease one substrate of the coagulation cascade. We also present six leptospiral adhesins and PLG- interacting proteins, rLIC12238, Lsa33, Lsa30, OmpL1, rLIC11360 and rLIC11975, as novel Fg-binding proteins. The recombinant proteins interact with Fg in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion when increasing protein concentration was set to react to a fix human Fg concentration. The calculated dissociation equilibrium constants (KD) of these reactions ranged from 733.3±276.8 to 128±89.9 nM for rLIC12238 and Lsa33, respectively. The interaction of recombinant proteins with human Fg resulted in inhibition of fibrin clot by thrombin-catalyzed reaction, suggesting that these versatile proteins could mediate Fg interaction in Leptospira. Our data reveal for the first time the inhibition of fibrin clot by Leptospira spp. and presents adhesins that could mediate these interactions. Decreasing fibrin clot would cause an imbalance of the coagulation cascade that may facilitate bleeding and help bacteria dissemination
","Leptospirosis is probably the most widespread zoonosis in the world. Caused by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira, it has greater incidence in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease has become prevalent in cities with sanitation problems and a large population of urban rodent reservoirs, which contaminate the environment through their urine. Understanding the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of leptospirosis should contribute to new strategies that would help fight the disease. We show in this work that Leptospira strains, virulent, attenuated or saprophytic are capable of binding fibrinogen (Fg). The interaction of leptospires with Fg inhibits the formation of fibrin clot that may result of an imbalance in the haemostatic equilibrium. In addition, we show that plasminogen (PLG)/plasmin (PLA) generation on the surface of leptospires can lead to Fg degradation, showing evidence of possible route of fibrinolysis in leptospirosis. We also present six leptospiral proteins, as novel Fg-binding proteins, capable of inhibiting fibrin clot formation by thrombin-catalyzed reaction, suggesting that in Leptospira these multifunctional proteins could mediate Fg interaction. Our data suggest possible mechanisms that leptospires could employ to affect the coagulation cascade and fibrinolytic system that might lead to bacteria spreading.

"Many genes of large double-stranded DNA viruses have a cellular origin, suggesting that host-to-virus horizontal transfer (HT) of DNA is recurrent. Yet, the frequency of these transfers has never been assessed in viral populations. Here we used ultra-deep DNA sequencing of 21 baculovirus populations extracted from two moth species to show that a large diversity of moth DNA sequences (n = 86) can integrate into viral genomes during the course of a viral infection. The majority of the 86 different moth DNA sequences are transposable elements (TEs, n = 69) belonging to 10 superfamilies of DNA transposons and three superfamilies of retrotransposons. The remaining 17 sequences are moth sequences of unknown nature. In addition to bona fide DNA transposition, we uncover microhomology-mediated recombination as a mechanism explaining integration of moth sequences into viral genomes. Many sequences integrated multiple times at multiple positions along the viral genome. We detected a total of 27,504 insertions of moth sequences in the 21 viral populations and we calculate that on average, 4.8% of viruses harbor at least one moth sequence in these populations. Despite this substantial proportion, no insertion of moth DNA was maintained in any viral population after 10 successive infection cycles. Hence, there is a constant turnover of host DNA inserted into viral genomes each time the virus infects a moth. Finally, we found that at least 21 of the moth TEs integrated into viral genomes underwent repeated horizontal transfers between various insect species, including some lepidopterans susceptible to baculoviruses. Our results identify host DNA influx as a potent source of genetic diversity in viral populations. They also support a role for baculoviruses as vectors of DNA HT between insects, and call for an evaluation of possible gene or TE spread when using viruses as biopesticides or gene delivery vectors.
","While gene exchange is known to occur between viruses and their hosts, this phenomenon has never been studied at the level of the viral population. Here we report that each time a virus from the Baculoviridae family infects a moth, a large number (dozens to hundreds) and high diversity of moth DNA sequences (86 different sequences) can integrate into replicating viral genomes. These findings show that viral populations carry a measurable load of host DNA sequences, further supporting the role of viruses as vectors of horizontal transfer of DNA between insect species. The potential uncontrolled gene spread associated with the use of viruses produced in insect cells as gene delivery vectors and/or biopesticides should therefore be evaluated.

"Networks are becoming a ubiquitous metaphor for the understanding of complex biological systems, spanning the range between molecular signalling pathways, neural networks in the brain, and interacting species in a food web. In many models, we face an intricate interplay between the topology of the network and the dynamics of the system, which is generally very hard to disentangle. A dynamical feature that has been subject of intense research in various fields are correlations between the noisy activity of nodes in a network. We consider a class of systems, where discrete signals are sent along the links of the network. Such systems are of particular relevance in neuroscience, because they provide models for networks of neurons that use action potentials for communication. We study correlations in dynamic networks with arbitrary topology, assuming linear pulse coupling. With our novel approach, we are able to understand in detail how specific structural motifs affect pairwise correlations. Based on a power series decomposition of the covariance matrix, we describe the conditions under which very indirect interactions will have a pronounced effect on correlations and population dynamics. In random networks, we find that indirect interactions may lead to a broad distribution of activation levels with low average but highly variable correlations. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in networks with distance dependent connectivity. In contrast, networks with highly connected hubs or patchy connections often exhibit strong average correlations. Our results are particularly relevant in view of new experimental techniques that enable the parallel recording of spiking activity from a large number of neurons, an appropriate interpretation of which is hampered by the currently limited understanding of structure-dynamics relations in complex networks.
","Many biological systems have been described as networks whose complex properties influence the behaviour of the system. Correlations of activity in such networks are of interest in a variety of fields, from gene-regulatory networks to neuroscience. Due to novel experimental techniques allowing the recording of the activity of many pairs of neurons and their importance with respect to the functional interpretation of spike data, spike train correlations in neural networks have recently attracted a considerable amount of attention. Although origin and function of these correlations is not known in detail, they are believed to have a fundamental influence on information processing and learning. We present a detailed explanation of how recurrent connectivity induces correlations in local neural networks and how structural features affect their size and distribution. We examine under which conditions network characteristics like distance dependent connectivity, hubs or patches markedly influence correlations and population signals.

"In recent years, the primate malaria Plasmodium knowlesi has emerged in human populations throughout South East Asia, with the largest hotspot being in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Control efforts are hindered by limited knowledge of where and when people get exposed to mosquito vectors. It is assumed that exposure occurs primarily when people are working in forest areas, but the role of other potential exposure routes (including domestic or peri-domestic transmission) has not been thoroughly investigated.
We integrated entomological surveillance within a comprehensive case-control study occurring within a large hotspot of transmission in Sabah, Malaysia. Mosquitoes were collected at 28 pairs households composed of one where an occupant had a confirmed P. knowlesi infection within the preceding 3 weeks (“case”) and an associated “control” where no infection was reported. Human landing catches were conducted to measure the number and diversity of mosquitoes host seeking inside houses and in the surrounding peri-domestic (outdoors but around the household) areas. The predominant malaria vector species was Anopheles balabacensis, most of which were caught outdoors in the early evening (6pm - 9pm). It was significantly more abundant in the peri-domestic area than inside houses (5.5-fold), and also higher at case than control households (0.28±0.194 vs 0.17±0.127, p<0.001). Ten out of 641 An. balabacensis tested were positive for simian malaria parasites, but none for P. knowlesi.
This study shows there is a possibility that humans can be exposed to P. knowlesi infection around their homes. The vector is highly exophagic and few were caught indoors indicating interventions using bednets inside households may have relatively little impact.
","The primate knowlesi malaria has now emerged in human populations throughout South East Asia. Our limited knowledge of where and when people get exposed to the vector (Anopheles balabacensis) has resulted in poor control measures, although it is assumed that exposure occurs primarily when people are working in forest areas.

Mosquitoes were collected at 28 pairs households composed of one where an occupant had a confirmed knowlesi malaria infection and an associated “control” where no infection was reported.

The vectors were also significantly more abundant in the peri-domestic area than inside houses (5.5-fold), and also higher at case than control households. Ten Anopheles (out of 641) were found positive for primate malaria parasites. This study shows that humans can be exposed to knowlesi infection around their homes. Given the vectors are mainly outdoor biters, interventions using insecticide treated bednets inside households may have relatively little impact. A paradigm shift in control methods is required to reduce infection of this primate malaria.

"Neurons develop distinctive dendritic morphologies to receive and process information. Previous experiments showed that competitive dendro-dendritic interactions play critical roles in shaping dendrites of the space-filling type, which uniformly cover their receptive field. We incorporated this finding in constructing a new mathematical model, in which reaction dynamics of two chemicals (activator and suppressor) are coupled to neuronal dendrite growth. Our numerical analysis determined the conditions for dendritic branching and suggested that the self-organizing property of the proposed system can underlie dendritogenesis. Furthermore, we found a clear correlation between dendrite shape and the distribution of the activator, thus providing a morphological criterion to predict the in vivo distribution of the hypothetical molecular complexes responsible for dendrite elongation and branching.
","Neurons elaborate two types of neuronal extensions. One is axon, which sends outputs to other neurons. Another is dendrite, which is specialized for receiving and processing synaptic or sensory inputs. Like elaborated branches of trees, the shape of dendrites is quite variable from one type to another, and different dendritic geometry contributes to differential informational processing and computation. For instance, neurons of the space-filling type (e.g., retinal ganglion cells) fill in an open space to pick up spatial information from every corner of their receptive field. Therefore, dendrite development is one of the representative examples of the emergence of function through morphogenesis. Previous experiments including ours showed that competitive dendro-dendritic interactions play critical roles in shaping dendrites of the space-filling type. In the present study, we incorporated this finding in constructing a new mathematical model, in which reaction dynamics of chemicals are coupled to neuronal dendrite growth. Our numerical analysis suggested that self-organizing property of the proposed system underlies formation of space-filling dendrites. Furthermore, we provided a morphological criterion to predict the in vivo distribution of the hypothetical molecular complexes responsible for dendrite elongation and branching. We have now found a substantial number of molecules involved in dendrite development, thus it is timely to discuss the prediction from this work.

"Microbiome studies suggest the presence of an interaction between the human gut microbiome and soil-transmitted helminth. Upon deworming, a complex interaction between the anthelminthic drug, helminths and microbiome composition might occur. To dissect this, we analyse the changes that take place in the gut bacteria profiles in samples from a double blind placebo controlled trial conducted in an area endemic for soil transmitted helminths in Indonesia.
Either placebo or albendazole were given every three months for a period of one and a half years. Helminth infection was assessed before and at 3 months after the last treatment round. In 150 subjects, the bacteria were profiled using the 454 pyrosequencing. Statistical analysis was performed cross-sectionally at pre-treatment to assess the effect of infection, and at post-treatment to determine the effect of infection and treatment on microbiome composition using the Dirichlet-multinomial regression model.
At a phylum level, at pre-treatment, no difference was seen in microbiome composition in terms of relative abundance between helminth-infected and uninfected subjects and at post-treatment, no differences were found in microbiome composition between albendazole and placebo group. However, in subjects who remained infected, there was a significant difference in the microbiome composition of those who had received albendazole and placebo. This difference was largely attributed to alteration of Bacteroidetes. Albendazole was more effective against Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworms but not against Trichuris trichiura, thus in those who remained infected after receiving albendazole, the helminth composition was dominated by T. trichiura.
We found that overall, albendazole does not affect the microbiome composition. However, there is an interaction between treatment and helminths as in subjects who received albendazole and remained infected there was a significant alteration in Bacteroidetes. This helminth-albendazole interaction needs to be studied further to fully grasp the complexity of the effect of deworming on the microbiome.

","Studying the relationship between soil-transmitted helminthiasis and gut microbiota is becoming more important as both have been implicated in modulating immune system in various inflammatory diseases. However, findings of previous studies of the effect of helminth on the microbiome are inconsistent. In this study, an optimal design, a placebo-controlled anthelminthic trial was conducted to dissect the effect of helminths and anthelminthic treatment on gut microbial profile. In addition, a novel statistical model was used to analyse the association by taking into account the correlation structures between bacterial categories by applying multivariate analysis whereby the multiple testing correction is not needed.

"During a dengue outbreak on the Caribbean island Aruba, highly elevated levels of ferritin were detected in dengue virus infected patients. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and hyperferritinaemia is a hallmark of diseases caused by extensive immune activation, such as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hyperferritinaemia in dengue patients was associated with clinical markers of extensive immune activation and coagulation disturbances.
Levels of ferritin, standard laboratory markers, sIL-2R, IL-18 and coagulation and fibrinolytic markers were determined in samples from patients with uncomplicated dengue in Aruba. Levels of ferritin were significantly increased in dengue patients compared to patients with other febrile illnesses. Moreover, levels of ferritin associated significantly with the occurrence of viraemia. Hyperferritinaemia was also significantly associated with thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes and coagulation disturbances. The results were validated in a cohort of dengue virus infected patients in Brazil. In this cohort levels of ferritin and cytokine profiles were determined. Increased levels of ferritin in dengue virus infected patients in Brazil were associated with disease severity and a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile.
Altogether, we provide evidence that ferritin can be used as a clinical marker to discriminate between dengue and other febrile illnesses. The occurrence of hyperferritinaemia in dengue virus infected patients is indicative for highly active disease resulting in immune activation and coagulation disturbances. Therefore, we recommend that patients with hyperferritinaemia are monitored carefully.
","Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and produced by reticulo-endothelial cells in response to inflammation and infection. In general, ferritin levels are increased in inflammatory conditions, but in this study we found that ferritin levels were much higher in dengue virus infected patients than in patients with other febrile illnesses. This indicates that ferritin could be used as a marker to discriminate between dengue and other febrile diseases. Moreover, the presence of hyperferritinaemia (ferritin levels≥500 µg/L) was associated with markers of immune activation and coagulation disturbances and clinical disease severity, suggesting that it could serve as a marker of activity of disease. Clinical markers to determine the presence and severity of dengue virus infection are important for diagnostic and treatment purposes. Our results indicate that increased ferritin levels could be used to increase the likelihood on a positive dengue diagnosis. Moreover, patients with hyperferritinaemia should be monitored carefully, because they are at risk to develop severe disease due to extensive immune activation.

"Muscle contracts due to ATP-dependent interactions of myosin motors with thin filaments composed of the proteins actin, troponin, and tropomyosin. Contraction is initiated when calcium binds to troponin, which changes conformation and displaces tropomyosin, a filamentous protein that wraps around the actin filament, thereby exposing myosin binding sites on actin. Myosin motors interact with each other indirectly via tropomyosin, since myosin binding to actin locally displaces tropomyosin and thereby facilitates binding of nearby myosin. Defining and modeling this local coupling between myosin motors is an open problem in muscle modeling and, more broadly, a requirement to understanding the connection between muscle contraction at the molecular and macro scale. It is challenging to directly observe this coupling, and such measurements have only recently been made. Analysis of these data suggests that two myosin heads are required to activate the thin filament. This result contrasts with a theoretical model, which reproduces several indirect measurements of coupling between myosin, that assumes a single myosin head can activate the thin filament. To understand this apparent discrepancy, we incorporated the model into stochastic simulations of the experiments, which generated simulated data that were then analyzed identically to the experimental measurements. By varying a single parameter, good agreement between simulation and experiment was established. The conclusion that two myosin molecules are required to activate the thin filament arises from an assumption, made during data analysis, that the intensity of the fluorescent tags attached to myosin varies depending on experimental condition. We provide an alternative explanation that reconciles theory and experiment without assuming that the intensity of the fluorescent tags varies.
","Despite decades of study, there is no clear connection between muscle contraction at the molecular and the macroscopic scale. For example, we cannot yet predict how a genetic defect in a muscle protein will result in a physiological change in the heart. This multi-scale understanding is difficult, in part, because molecules cooperate during muscle contraction; that is, one molecule’s behavior is influenced by the behavior of its neighbors. It is difficult to make direct measurements from such coupled molecular systems and also difficult to describe them quantitatively. Despite these obstacles, we recently published experimental measurements and theoretical models of this coupling, but there were apparent discrepancies between the two. Here, we use detailed computer simulations of these experiments to show that, in fact, the measurements agree with the model to a remarkable extent. This agreement suggests that the model captures the essential molecular events that underlie the coupling between muscle molecules. This removes a major obstacle to a multi-scale understanding of muscle contraction and, while more work is necessary, suggests that a connection between the molecular and macroscopic scale is within reach.

"The serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR)–a key regulator of diverse neurological processes–exhibits functional variability derived from editing of its pre-mRNA by site-specific adenosine deamination (A-to-I pre-mRNA editing) in five distinct sites. Here we describe a statistical technique that was developed for analysis of the dependencies among the editing states of the five sites. The statistical significance of the observed correlations was estimated by comparing editing patterns in multiple individuals. For both human and rat 5-HT2CR, the editing states of the physically proximal sites A and B were found to be strongly dependent. In contrast, the editing states of sites C and D, which are also physically close, seem not to be directly dependent but instead are linked through the dependencies on sites A and B, respectively. We observed pronounced differences between the editing patterns in humans and rats: in humans site A is the key determinant of the editing state of the other sites, whereas in rats this role belongs to site B. The structure of the dependencies among the editing sites is notably simpler in rats than it is in humans implying more complex regulation of 5-HT2CR editing and, by inference, function in the human brain. Thus, exhaustive statistical analysis of the 5-HT2CR editing patterns indicates that the editing state of sites A and B is the primary determinant of the editing states of the other three sites, and hence the overall editing pattern. Taken together, these findings allow us to propose a mechanistic model of concerted action of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in 5-HT2CR editing. Statistical approach developed here can be applied to other cases of interdependencies among modification sites in RNA and proteins.
","The serotonin receptor 2C is a key regulator of diverse neurological processes that affect feeding behavior, sleep, sexual behavior, anxiety and depression. The function of the receptor itself is regulated via so-called pre-mRNA editing, i.e. site-specific adenosine deamination in five distinct sites. The greater the number of edited sites in the serotonin receptor mRNA, the lower the activity of the receptor it encodes. Here we used the results of extensive massively parallel sequencing from human and rat brains to elucidate the dependencies among the editing states of the five sites. Despite the apparent simplicity of the problem, disambiguation of these dependencies is a difficult task that required development of a new statistical technique. We employed this method to analyse the dependencies among editing in the 5 susceptible sites of the receptor mRNA and found that the proximal, juxtaposed sites A and B are strongly interdependent, and that the editing state of these two sites is a major determinant of the editing states of the other three sites, and hence the overall editing pattern. The statistical approach we developed for the analysis of mRNA editing can be applied to other cases of multiple site modification in RNA and proteins.

"The dynamics of the late stages of the HIV-1 life cycle are poorly documented. Viral replication dynamics are typically measured in populations of infected cells, but asynchrony that is introduced during the early steps of HIV-1 replication complicates the measurement of the progression of subsequent steps and can mask replication dynamics and their variation in individual infected cells. We established microscopy-based methods to dynamically measure HIV-1-encoded reporter gene and antiviral gene expression in individual infected cells. We coupled these measurements with conventional analyses to quantify delays in the HIV-1 replication cycle imposed by the biphasic nature of HIV-1 gene expression and by the assembly-inhibiting property of the matrix domain of Gag. We further related the dynamics of restriction factor (APOBEC3G) removal to the dynamics of HIV-1 replication in individual cells. These studies provide a timeline for key events in the HIV-1 replication cycle, and reveal that the interval between the onset of early and late HIV-1 gene expression is only ~3h, but matrix causes a ~6–12h delay in the generation of extracellular virions. Interestingly, matrix delays particle assembly to a time at which APOBEC3G has largely been removed from the cell. Thus, a need to prepare infected cells to be efficient producers of infectious HIV-1 may provide an impetus for programmed delays in HIV-1 virion genesis. Our findings also emphasize the significant heterogeneity in the length of the HIV-1 replication cycle in homogenous cell populations and suggest that a typical infected cell generates new virions for only a few hours at the end of a 48h lifespan. Therefore, small changes in the lifespan of infected cells might have a large effect on viral yield in a single cycle and the overall clinical course in infected individuals.
","The HIV-1 replication cycle is composed of several sequential steps. While the timing of the early steps of HIV-1 replication is quite well understood, measuring the duration of later steps is complicated by the fact that asynchrony is introduced into populations of infected cells during early steps. We devised imaging methods for measuring the duration of late steps in HIV-1 replication in single infected cells, circumventing the problems associated with measurements in populations of asynchronously infected cells. By combining these measurements with conventional analyses of HIV-1 replication in populations of cells, we derived a time-line of key events during the late steps of the HIV-1 life cycle. We find that the delay between early and late gene expression is small but that a subsequent programmed delay in virus assembly enables HIV-1 to remove a host antiviral protein from infected cells before new virions are generated. In so doing, HIV-1 may prevent futile virion production.

"To escape CD8+ T-cell immunity, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US11 redirects MHC-I for rapid ER-associated proteolytic degradation (ERAD). In humans, classical MHC-I molecules are encoded by the highly polymorphic HLA-A, -B and -C gene loci. While HLA-C resists US11 degradation, the specificity for HLA-A and HLA-B products has not been systematically studied. In this study we analyzed the MHC-I peptide ligands in HCMV-infected cells. A US11-dependent loss of HLA-A ligands was observed, but not of HLA-B. We revealed a general ability of HLA-B to assemble with β2m and exit from the ER in the presence of US11. Surprisingly, a low-complexity region between the signal peptide sequence and the Ig-like domain of US11, was necessary to form a stable interaction with assembled MHC-I and, moreover, this region was also responsible for changing the pool of HLA-B ligands. Our data suggest a two-pronged strategy by US11 to escape CD8+ T-cell immunity, firstly, by degrading HLA-A molecules, and secondly, by manipulating the HLA-B ligandome.
","The human immune system can cover the presentation of a wide array of pathogen derived antigens owing to the three extraordinary polymorphic MHC class I (MHC-I) gene loci, called HLA-A, -B and -C in humans. Studying the HLA peptide ligands of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infected cells, we realized that the HCMV encoded glycoprotein US11 targeted different HLA gene products in distinct manners. More than 20 years ago the first HCMV encoded MHC-I inhibitors were identified, including US11, targeting MHC-I for proteasomal degradation. Here, we describe that the prime target for US11-mediated degradation is HLA-A, whereas HLA-B can resist degradation. Our further mechanistic analysis revealed that US11 uses various domains for distinct functions. Remarkably, the ability of US11 to interact with assembled MHC-I and modify peptide loading of degradation-resistant HLA-B was dependent on a low-complexity region (LCR) located between the signal peptide and the immunoglobulin-like domain of US11. To redirect MHC-I for proteasomal degradation the LCR was dispensable. These findings now raise the intriguing question why US11 has evolved to target HLA-A and -B differentially. Possibly, HLA-B molecules are spared in order to dampen NK cell attack against infected cells.

"A CpG island (CGI) lies at the 5′ end of the Airn macro non-protein-coding (nc) RNA that represses the flanking Igf2r promoter in cis on paternally inherited chromosomes. In addition to being modified on maternally inherited chromosomes by a DNA methylation imprint, the Airn CGI shows two unusual organization features: its position immediately downstream of the Airn promoter and transcription start site and a series of tandem direct repeats (TDRs) occupying its second half. The physical separation of the Airn promoter from the CGI provides a model to investigate if the CGI plays distinct transcriptional and epigenetic roles. We used homologous recombination to generate embryonic stem cells carrying deletions at the endogenous locus of the entire CGI or just the TDRs. The deleted Airn alleles were analyzed by using an ES cell imprinting model that recapitulates the onset of Igf2r imprinted expression in embryonic development or by using knock-out mice. The results show that the CGI is required for efficient Airn initiation and to maintain the unmethylated state of the Airn promoter, which are both necessary for Igf2r repression on the paternal chromosome. The TDRs occupying the second half of the CGI play a minor role in Airn transcriptional elongation or processivity, but are essential for methylation on the maternal Airn promoter that is necessary for Igf2r to be expressed from this chromosome. Together the data indicate the existence of a class of regulatory CGIs in the mammalian genome that act downstream of the promoter and transcription start.
","CpG islands are CG-rich regions associated with the majority of mammalian promoters. Although widely considered to be necessary for promoter activity, their exact function is unknown. CpG islands are mostly unmethylated during development and differentiate with notable exceptions including imprinted genes and genes on the inactive X chromosome. Here we analysed how the imprinted Airn ncRNA CpG island, that is normally methylated on the maternal and unmethylated on the paternal chromosome, regulates its associated upstream promoter. We used embryonic stem cells or mice carrying a deletion of either the whole CpG island or of the second half that contains an unusual series of tandem direct repeats. Our results show that the CpG island is needed for efficient transcription of the Airn promoter on the paternal chromosome and to keep it free from DNA methylation. The series of tandem direct repeats plays a minor role in regulating the length of the Airn transcript on the paternal chromosome but is essential for DNA methylation of the Airn promoter on the maternal chromosome. These results show that CpG islands do not only function as classical promoters to bind RNA polymerase II and initiate transcription, but can also play other roles in regulating transcription processivity as well as the epigenetic state of their associated promoter.

"Mutualistic symbioses between eukaryotes and beneficial microorganisms of their microbiome play an essential role in nutrition, protection against disease, and development of the host. However, the impact of beneficial symbionts on the evolution of host genomes remains poorly characterized. Here we used the independent loss of the most widespread plant–microbe symbiosis, arbuscular mycorrhization (AM), as a model to address this question. Using a large phenotypic approach and phylogenetic analyses, we present evidence that loss of AM symbiosis correlates with the loss of many symbiotic genes in the Arabidopsis lineage (Brassicales). Then, by analyzing the genome and/or transcriptomes of nine other phylogenetically divergent non-host plants, we show that this correlation occurred in a convergent manner in four additional plant lineages, demonstrating the existence of an evolutionary pattern specific to symbiotic genes. Finally, we use a global comparative phylogenomic approach to track this evolutionary pattern among land plants. Based on this approach, we identify a set of 174 highly conserved genes and demonstrate enrichment in symbiosis-related genes. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that beneficial symbionts maintain purifying selection on host gene networks during the evolution of entire lineages.
","Symbiotic associations between eukaryotes and microbes play essential roles in the nutrition, health and behavior of both partners. It is well accepted that hosts control and shape their associated microbiome. In this study, we provide evidence that symbiotic microbes also participate in the evolution of host genomes. In particular, we show that the independent loss of a symbiosis in several plant lineages results in a convergent modification of non-host genomes. Interestingly, a significant fraction of genes lost in non-hosts play an important role in this symbiosis, supporting the use of comparative genomics as a powerful approach to identify undiscovered gene networks.

"Down Syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and results in a spectrum of phenotypes including learning and memory deficits, and motor dysfunction. It has been hypothesized that an additional copy of a few Hsa21 dosage-sensitive genes causes these phenotypes, but this has been challenged by observations that aneuploidy can cause phenotypes by the mass action of large numbers of genes, with undetectable contributions from individual sequences. The motor abnormalities in DS are relatively understudied—the identity of causative dosage-sensitive genes and the mechanism underpinning the phenotypes are unknown. Using a panel of mouse strains with duplications of regions of mouse chromosomes orthologous to Hsa21 we show that increased dosage of small numbers of genes causes locomotor dysfunction and, moreover, that the Dyrk1a gene is required in three copies to cause the phenotype. Furthermore, we show for the first time a new DS phenotype: loss of motor neurons both in mouse models and, importantly, in humans with DS, that may contribute to locomotor dysfunction.
","Down Syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and results in many different phenotypes including learning difficulties, Alzheimer’s disease and problems with motor function such as abnormal gait and poor fine motor skills. These different phenotypes are thought to result from an increased copy of one more of the genes on chromosome 21, but it is not known which gene or genes cause the phenotypes. Using a panel of mouse strains with an extra copy of different sets of mouse genes that are equivalent to the human genes on chromosome 21 we were able to show that an extra copy of a small number of genes was sufficient to cause motor abnormalities in the mice, and that one of these genes, Dyrk1a, was required in three copies for this phenotype. Furthermore, we found that these mouse models of Down Syndrome showed loss of motor neurons, which could account in part for the motor dysfunction. This result led us to look in spinal cords from humans with DS, where we also found decreased numbers of motor neurons, a phenotype that has never been previously reported.

"Differences between noninfective first-stage (L1) and infective third-stage (L3i)
                  larvae of parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis at the
                  molecular level are relatively uncharacterized. DNA microarrays were developed and
                  utilized for this purpose.
Oligonucleotide hybridization probes for the array were designed to bind 3,571
                  putative mRNA transcripts predicted by analysis of 11,335 expressed sequence tags
                  (ESTs) obtained as part of the Nematode EST project. RNA obtained from S.
                     stercoralis L3i and L1 was co-hybridized to each array after labeling
                  the individual samples with different fluorescent tags. Bioinformatic predictions
                  of gene function were developed using a novel cDNA Annotation System software. We
                  identified 935 differentially expressed genes (469 L3i-biased; 466 L1-biased)
                  having two-fold expression differences or greater and microarray signals with a p
                  value<0.01. Based on a functional analysis, L1 larvae have a larger number of
                  genes putatively involved in transcription (p = 0.004), and
                  L3i larvae have biased expression of putative heat shock proteins (such as
                     hsp-90). Genes with products known to be immunoreactive in
                     S. stercoralis-infected humans (such as SsIR
                  and NIE) had L3i biased expression. Abundantly expressed L3i
                  contigs of interest included S. stercoralis orthologs of
                  cytochrome oxidase ucr 2.1 and hsp-90, which may
                  be potential chemotherapeutic targets. The S. stercoralis
                  ortholog of fatty acid and retinol binding protein-1, successfully used in a
                  vaccine against Ancylostoma ceylanicum, was identified among the
                  25 most highly expressed L3i genes. The sperm-containing glycoprotein domain,
                  utilized in a vaccine against the nematode Cooperia punctata, was
                  exclusively found in L3i biased genes and may be a valuable S.

A new DNA microarray tool for the examination of S. stercoralis
                  biology has been developed and provides new and valuable insights regarding
                  differences between infective and noninfective S. stercoralis
                  larvae. Potential therapeutic and vaccine targets were identified for further
                  study.
","Strongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted helminth that
               affects an estimated 30–100 million people worldwide. Chronically infected
               persons who are exposed to corticosteroids can develop disseminated disease, which
               carries a high mortality (87–100%) if untreated. Despite this, little is
               known about the fundamental biology of this parasite, including the features that
               enable infection. We developed the first DNA microarray for this parasite and used it
               to compare infective third-stage larvae (L3i) with non-infective first stage larvae
               (L1). Using this method, we identified 935 differentially expressed genes. Functional
               characterization of these genes revealed L3i biased expression of heat shock proteins
               and genes with products that have previously been shown to be immunoreactive in
               infected humans. Genes putatively involved in transcription were found to have L1
               biased expression. Potential chemotherapeutic and vaccine targets such as
                  far-1, ucr 2.1 and hsp-90 were
               identified for further study.

"Diseases of humans and wildlife are typically tracked and studied through incidence, the number of new infections per time unit. Estimating incidence is not without difficulties, as asymptomatic infections, low sampling intervals and low sample sizes can introduce large estimation errors. After infection, biomarkers such as antibodies or pathogens often change predictably over time, and this temporal pattern can contain information about the time since infection that could improve incidence estimation. Antibody level and avidity have been used to estimate time since infection and to recreate incidence, but the errors on these estimates using currently existing methods are generally large. Using a semi-parametric model in a Bayesian framework, we introduce a method that allows the use of multiple sources of information (such as antibody level, pathogen presence in different organs, individual age, season) for estimating individual time since infection. When sufficient background data are available, this method can greatly improve incidence estimation, which we show using arenavirus infection in multimammate mice as a test case. The method performs well, especially compared to the situation in which seroconversion events between sampling sessions are the main data source. The possibility to implement several sources of information allows the use of data that are in many cases already available, which means that existing incidence data can be improved without the need for additional sampling efforts or laboratory assays.
","Human and wildlife diseases can be tracked by looking at incidence, which is the number of new infections per time unit (typically day, week or month). While theoretically this would only be a matter of counting the number of newly infected individuals, in reality these data are difficult to acquire due to limited sampling possibilities and undetectable cases. This means that a method must be used to estimate the real incidence using a limited amount of data. For many infections, the concentration and quality of antibodies changes predictably over time, which means that one could use the antibody level at any point in time to back-calculate how much time passed since the infection entered the body. Other information, such as the age of the individual, or the presence of the pathogen, can also help to estimate when an individual became infected. Improving on existing methods, we developed a method that allows the use of a wide range of information sources for estimating individual time since infection. Using arenavirus infection in mice, we show that this method works well when sufficient background data are available, and that it can greatly improve the estimation of incidence patterns.

"Infectious prions contain a self-propagating, misfolded conformer of the prion protein termed PrPSc. A critical prediction of the protein-only hypothesis is that autocatalytic PrPSc molecules should be infectious. However, some autocatalytic recombinant PrPSc molecules have low or undetectable levels of specific infectivity in bioassays, and the essential determinants of recombinant prion infectivity remain obscure. To identify structural and functional features specifically associated with infectivity, we compared the properties of two autocatalytic recombinant PrP conformers derived from the same original template, which differ by >105-fold in specific infectivity for wild-type mice. Structurally, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) studies revealed that solvent accessibility profiles of infectious and non-infectious autocatalytic recombinant PrP conformers are remarkably similar throughout their protease-resistant cores, except for two domains encompassing residues 91-115 and 144-163. Raman spectroscopy and immunoprecipitation studies confirm that these domains adopt distinct conformations within infectious versus non-infectious autocatalytic recombinant PrP conformers. Functionally, in vitro prion propagation experiments show that the non-infectious conformer is unable to seed mouse PrPC substrates containing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, including native PrPC. Taken together, these results indicate that having a conformation that can be specifically adopted by post-translationally modified PrPC molecules is an essential determinant of biological infectivity for recombinant prions, and suggest that this ability is associated with discrete features of PrPSc structure.
","A key prediction of the prion hypothesis is that autocatalytic, misfolded PrPSc molecules should be highly infectious. Various recombinant PrPSc conformers are able to self-propagate in vitro, yet paradoxically only some of these conformers possess significant levels of specific infectivity in bioassays. Here we use two closely-matched autocatalytic recombinant PrP conformers that share the same origin but differ by >105-fold in specific infectivity to study the molecular basis of prion infectivity. We show that infectious and non-infectious autocatalytic recombinant PrP conformers have subtle structural differences, and that GPI-anchored PrP substrate molecules can only adopt the infectious PrPSc conformation. We conclude that post-translational modifications of host PrPC molecules play a critical role in restricting the range of recombinant PrPSc conformers that are biologically infectious.

"Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) is a disease caused by Hantavirus, which is highly virulent for humans. High temperatures and conversion of native vegetation to agriculture, particularly sugarcane cultivation can alter abundance of rodent generalist species that serve as the principal reservoir host for HCPS, but our understanding of the compound effects of land use and climate on HCPS incidence remains limited, particularly in tropical regions. Here we rely on a Bayesian model to fill this research gap and to predict the effects of sugarcane expansion and expected changes in temperature on Hantavirus infection risk in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The sugarcane expansion scenario was based on historical data between 2000 and 2010 combined with an agro-environment zoning guideline for the sugar and ethanol industry. Future evolution of temperature anomalies was derived using 32 general circulation models from scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Representative greenhouse gases Concentration Pathways adopted by IPCC). Currently, the state of São Paulo has an average Hantavirus risk of 1.3%, with 6% of the 645 municipalities of the state being classified as high risk (HCPS risk ≥ 5%). Our results indicate that sugarcane expansion alone will increase average HCPS risk to 1.5%, placing 20% more people at HCPS risk. Temperature anomalies alone increase HCPS risk even more (1.6% for RCP4.5 and 1.7%, for RCP8.5), and place 31% and 34% more people at risk. Combined sugarcane and temperature increases led to the same predictions as scenarios that only included temperature. Our results demonstrate that climate change effects are likely to be more severe than those from sugarcane expansion. Forecasting disease is critical for the timely and efficient planning of operational control programs that can address the expected effects of sugarcane expansion and climate change on HCPS infection risk. The predicted spatial location of HCPS infection risks obtained here can be used to prioritize management actions and develop educational campaigns.
","Hantavirus, hosted by rodent species, causes HCPS, a disease with a 50% mortality rate in humans. The conversion of native vegetation to sugarcane increases the abundance of hantavirus reservoir rodent species, augmenting disease risk. Additionally, temperature also has positive effects on disease risk because it affects rodent population and the time the virus remains infectious in the environment. Here we evaluate the impacts of climate change and sugarcane expansion on HCPS risk. Expansion of sugarcane increases average HCPS risk placing 20% more people at risk for acquiring HCPS than under current conditions. Temperature anomalies increase HCPS risk even more and place 31% and 34% more people at risk (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively). Our results confirm the impacts of climate change and agriculture expansion on disease risk and highlight the need for timely and efficient planning of operational control programs in order to avoid disease propagation in the future.

"Recognition of conserved bacterial products by innate immune receptors leads to inflammatory responses that control pathogen spread but that can also result in pathology. Intestinal epithelial cells are exposed to bacterial products and therefore must prevent signaling through innate immune receptors to avoid pathology. However, enteric pathogens are able to stimulate intestinal inflammation. We show here that the enteric pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium can stimulate innate immune responses in cultured epithelial cells by mechanisms that do not involve receptors of the innate immune system. Instead, S. Typhimurium stimulates these responses by delivering through its type III secretion system the bacterial effector proteins SopE, SopE2, and SopB, which in a redundant fashion stimulate Rho-family GTPases leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and NF-κB signaling. These observations have implications for the understanding of the mechanisms by which Salmonella Typhimurium induces intestinal inflammation as well as other intestinal inflammatory pathologies.
","Salmonella Typhimurium is one of the most common causes of food-borne illness in the United States and a major cause of diarrheal diseases in developing countries. This pathogen induces diarrhea by stimulating inflammation in the intestinal tract. This study shows that S. Typhimurium delivers molecules into epithelial cells with the capacity to stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory substances. This mechanism may help the pathogen to initiate the inflammatory response in the intestinal epithelium. This study provides insight into the mechanisms by which Salmonella Typhimurium causes diarrhea.

"Previous work in Arabidopsis showed that after an ancient tetraploidy event, genes were preferentially removed from one of the two homeologs, a process known as fractionation. The mechanism of fractionation is unknown. We sought to determine whether such preferential, or biased, fractionation exists in maize and, if so, whether a specific mechanism could be implicated in this process. We studied the process of fractionation using two recently sequenced grass species: sorghum and maize. The maize lineage has experienced a tetraploidy since its divergence from sorghum approximately 12 million years ago, and fragments of many knocked-out genes retain enough sequence similarity to be easily identifiable. Using sorghum exons as the query sequence, we studied the fate of both orthologous genes in maize following the maize tetraploidy. We show that genes are predominantly lost, not relocated, and that single-gene loss by deletion is the rule. Based on comparisons with orthologous sorghum and rice genes, we also infer that the sequences present before the deletion events were flanked by short direct repeats, a signature of intra-chromosomal recombination. Evidence of this deletion mechanism is found 2.3 times more frequently on one of the maize homeologs, consistent with earlier observations of biased fractionation. The over-fractionated homeolog is also a greater than 3-fold better target for transposon removal, but does not have an observably higher synonymous base substitution rate, nor could we find differentially placed methylation domains. We conclude that fractionation is indeed biased in maize and that intra-chromosomal or possibly a similar illegitimate recombination is the primary mechanism by which fractionation occurs. The mechanism of intra-chromosomal recombination explains the observed bias in both gene and transposon loss in the maize lineage. The existence of fractionation bias demonstrates that the frequency of deletion is modulated. Among the evolutionary benefits of this deletion/fractionation mechanism is bulk DNA removal and the generation of novel combinations of regulatory sequences and coding regions.
","All genomes can accumulate dispensable DNA in the form of duplications of individual genes or even partial or whole genome duplications. Genomes also can accumulate selfish DNA elements. Duplication events specifically are often followed by extensive gene loss. The maize genome is particularly extreme, having become tetraploid 10 million years ago and played host to massive transposon amplifications. We compared the genome of sorghum (which is homologous to the pre-tetraploid maize genome) with the two identifiable parental genomes retained in maize. The two maize genomes differ greatly: one of the parental genomes has lost 2.3 times more genes than the other, and the selfish DNA regions between genes were even more frequently lost, suggesting maize can distinguish between the parental genomes present in the original tetraploid. We show that genes are actually lost, not simply relocated. Deletions were rarely longer than a single gene, and occurred between repeated DNA sequences, suggesting mis-recombination as a mechanism of gene removal. We hypothesize an epigenetic mechanism of genome distinction to account for the selective loss. To the extent that the rate of base substitutions tracks time, we neither support nor refute claims of maize allotetraploidy. Finally, we explain why it makes sense that purifying selection in mammals does not operate at all like the gene and genome deletion program we describe here.

"Relapsing fever spirochetes are global yet neglected pathogens causing recurrent febrile episodes, chills, nausea, vomiting, and pregnancy complications. Given these nonspecific clinical manifestations, improving diagnostic assays for relapsing fever spirochetes will allow for identification of endemic foci and expedite proper treatment. Previously, an antigen designated the Borrelia immunogenic protein A (BipA) was identified in the North American species Borrelia hermsii. Thus far, BipA appears unique to relapsing fever spirochetes. The antigen remains unidentified outside of these pathogens, while interspecies amino acid identity for BipA in relapsing fever spirochetes is only 24–36%. The current study investigated the immunogenicity of BipA in Borrelia turicatae, a species distributed in the southern United States and Latin America.
bipA was amplified from six isolates of Borrelia turicatae, and sequence analysis demonstrated that the gene is conserved among isolates. A tick transmission system was developed for B. turicatae in mice and a canine, two likely vertebrate hosts, which enabled the evaluation of serological responses against recombinant BipA (rBipA). These studies indicated that BipA is antigenic in both animal systems after infection by tick bite, yet serum antibodies failed to bind to B. hermsii rBipA at a detectable level. Moreover, mice continued to generate an antibody response against BipA one year after the initial infection, further demonstrating the protein's potential toward identifying endemic foci for B. turicatae.
These initial studies support the hypothesis that BipA is a spirochete antigen unique to a relapsing fever Borrelia species, and could be used to improve efforts for identifying B. turicatae endemic regions.
","Undiagnosed febrile illnesses continue to afflict those in resource poor countries. Relapsing fever spirochetes are one such pathogen causing a significant health burden, yet the pathogenesis, ecology, and distribution of B. turicatae is understudied. To address these shortcomings, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of the Borrelia immunogenic protein A (BipA) in isolates of B. turicatae. Mice and a canine were also infected by tick bite and transmission and serological responses were evaluated in these two likely mammalian hosts. B. turicatae was visualized within the blood of both animals and antibody responses generated against recombinant BipA indicated that the antigen that may be unique to infections caused by B. turicatae. Moreover, mice continued to generate antibodies a year after tick bite, suggesting a persistent infection. Our results indicate that the immune responses generated against BipA could identify additional vertebrate hosts, define endemic foci for B. turicatae, and increase the awareness of the disease to improve healthcare.

"Methylation is a post-translational modification that can affect numerous features of proteins, notably cellular localization, turnover, activity, and molecular interactions. Recent genome-wide analyses have considerably extended the list of human genes encoding putative methyltransferases. Studies on protein methyltransferases have revealed that the regulatory function of methylation is not limited to epigenetics, with many non-histone substrates now being discovered. We present here our findings on a novel family of distantly related putative methyltransferases. Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry shows a marked preference for these proteins to associate with various chaperones. Based on the spectral data, we were able to identify methylation sites in substrates, notably trimethylation of K135 of KIN/Kin17, K561 of HSPA8/Hsc70 as well as corresponding lysine residues in other Hsp70 isoforms, and K315 of VCP/p97. All modification sites were subsequently confirmed in vitro. In the case of VCP, methylation by METTL21D was stimulated by the addition of the UBX cofactor ASPSCR1, which we show directly interacts with the methyltransferase. This stimulatory effect was lost when we used VCP mutants (R155H, R159G, and R191Q) known to cause Inclusion Body Myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and Fronto-temporal Dementia (IBMPFD) and/or familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Lysine 315 falls in proximity to the Walker B motif of VCP's first ATPase/D1 domain. Our results indicate that methylation of this site negatively impacts its ATPase activity. Overall, this report uncovers a new role for protein methylation as a regulatory pathway for molecular chaperones and defines a novel regulatory mechanism for the chaperone VCP, whose deregulation is causative of degenerative neuromuscular diseases.
","Methylation, or transfer of a single or multiple methyl groups (CH3), is one of many post-translational modifications that occur on proteins. Such modifications can, in turn, affect numerous aspects of a protein, notably cellular localization, turnover, activity, and molecular interactions. In addition to post-translational modifications, the structural organization of a protein or protein complex can also have a significant impact on its function and stability. A group of factors known as “molecular chaperones” aid newly synthesized proteins in reaching their native conformation or alternating between physiologically relevant states. We present here a new family of factors that promote methylation of chaperones and show that, at least in one case, this modification translates into a modulation in the activity of the substrate chaperone. Our results not only characterize the function of previously unknown gene products, uncover a new role for protein methylation as a regulatory pathway for chaperones, and define a novel regulatory mechanism for the chaperone VCP, whose deregulation is causative of neuromuscular diseases, but also suggest the existence of a post-translational modification code that regulates molecular chaperones. Further decrypting this “chaperone code” will help understanding how the functional organization of the proteome is orchestrated.

"Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) is an intestinal trematode that has been extensively used as experimental model to investigate the factors determining the expulsion of intestinal helminths or, in contrast, the development of chronic infections. Herein, we analyze the changes in protein expression induced by E. caproni infection in ICR mice, a host of high compatibility in which the parasites develop chronic infections.
To determine the changes in protein expression, a two-dimensional DIGE approach using protein extracts from the intestine of naïve and infected mice was employed; and spots showing significant differential expression were analyzed by mass spectrometry. A total of 37 spots were identified differentially expressed in infected mice (10 were found to be over-expressed and 27 down-regulated). These proteins were related to the restoration of the intestinal epithelium and the control of homeostatic dysregulation, concomitantly with mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins among others.
Our results suggests that changes in these processes in the ileal epithelium of ICR mice may facilitate the establishment of the parasite and the development of chronic infections. These results may serve to explain the factors determining the development of chronicity in intestinal helminth infection.
","Intestinal helminth infections are among the most prevalent parasitic diseases and about 1 billion people are currently infected with intestinal helminths. Incidence of intestinal helminth infections is high due to both socio-economic factors that facilitates continuous re-infections and the lack of effective vaccines. In this context, further knowledge on the host-parasite relationships is required to elucidate the factors that determine the expulsion of the intestinal helminths or, in contrast, the chronic establishment of the infections. Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda) is an intestinal trematode that has been extensively used as experimental model to investigate these factors. Depending on the host species. E. caproni is rapidly rejected or develops chronic infections. Herein, we analyze the changes in protein expression induced by E. caproni infection in a host in which the parasites develop chronic infections. These data may serve to get a better understanding of the factors determining the development of chronic intestinal infections. A total of 37 spots were identified differentially expressed. These proteins were related to the restoration of the intestinal epithelium and the control of homeostatic dysregulation, mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins among others. This suggests that the changes in these processes in the intestinal mucosa may facilitate the development of chronic infections.

"Although a defect in the DNA polymerase POLQ leads to ionizing radiation sensitivity in mammalian cells, the relevant enzymatic pathway has not been identified. Here we define the specific mechanism by which POLQ restricts harmful DNA instability. Our experiments show that Polq-null murine cells are selectively hypersensitive to DNA strand breaking agents, and that damage resistance requires the DNA polymerase activity of POLQ. Using a DNA break end joining assay in cells, we monitored repair of DNA ends with long 3′ single-stranded overhangs. End joining events retaining much of the overhang were dependent on POLQ, and independent of Ku70. To analyze the repair function in more detail, we examined immunoglobulin class switch joining between DNA segments in antibody genes. POLQ participates in end joining of a DNA break during immunoglobulin class-switching, producing insertions of base pairs at the joins with homology to IgH switch-region sequences. Biochemical experiments with purified human POLQ protein revealed the mechanism generating the insertions during DNA end joining, relying on the unique ability of POLQ to extend DNA from minimally paired primers. DNA breaks at the IgH locus can sometimes join with breaks in Myc, creating a chromosome translocation. We found a marked increase in Myc/IgH translocations in Polq-defective mice, showing that POLQ suppresses genomic instability and genome rearrangements originating at DNA double-strand breaks. This work clearly defines a role and mechanism for mammalian POLQ in an alternative end joining pathway that suppresses the formation of chromosomal translocations. Our findings depart from the prevailing view that alternative end joining processes are generically translocation-prone.
","The reason for the hypersensitivity of POLQ-defective mammalian cells to ionizing radiation has been elusive. Here we show that POLQ-defective mammalian cells are selectively susceptible to double-strand breaks in DNA. We present experiments in mammalian cells showing that a specific double-strand break repair pathway is POLQ-dependent. To analyze the repair function in more detail, we examined class switch joining between DNA segments in antibody genes. Insertions of DNA bases are sometimes found at the joins between such segments, but the origin of these insertions has been mysterious. We show that this class of insertion joins during immunoglobulin class-switching is entirely POLQ-dependent. In experiments with purified human POLQ protein, we found a novel biochemical mechanism explaining the formation of the insertions. POLQ has a unique biochemical ability to extend DNA with minimal base pairing. Finally, we examined the biological consequences for chromosome stability. Unexpectedly, the Burkitt lymphoma translocation (a major cancer-associated genome instability) is enhanced in the absence of POLQ. This alters the current view about the action of DNA end joining in mammalian cells, revealing that a POLQ-dependent DNA repair pathway combats potentially damaging chromosome translocations.

"Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) inactivating mutations are present in most human colorectal cancers and some other cancers. The APC protein regulates the β-catenin protein pool that functions as a co-activator of T cell factor (TCF)-regulated transcription in Wnt pathway signaling. We studied effects of reduced dosage of the Ctnnb1 gene encoding β-catenin in Apc-mutation-induced colon and ovarian mouse tumorigenesis and cell culture models. Concurrent somatic inactivation of one Ctnnb1 allele, dramatically inhibited Apc mutation-induced colon polyposis and greatly extended Apc-mutant mouse survival. Ctnnb1 hemizygous dose markedly inhibited increases in β-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus following Apc inactivation in colon epithelium, with attenuated expression of key β-catenin/TCF-regulated target genes, including those encoding the EphB2/B3 receptors, the stem cell marker Lgr5, and Myc, leading to maintenance of crypt compartmentalization and restriction of stem and proliferating cells to the crypt base. A critical threshold for β-catenin levels in TCF-regulated transcription was uncovered for Apc mutation-induced effects in colon epithelium, along with evidence of a feed-forward role for β-catenin in Ctnnb1 gene expression and CTNNB1 transcription. The active β-catenin protein pool was highly sensitive to CTNNB1 transcript levels in colon cancer cells. In mouse ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas (OEAs) arising from Apc- and Pten-inactivation, while Ctnnb1 hemizygous dose affected β-catenin levels and some β-catenin/TCF target genes, Myc induction was retained and OEAs arose in a fashion akin to that seen with intact Ctnnb1 gene dose. Our findings indicate Ctnnb1 gene dose exerts tissue-specific differences in Apc mutation-instigated tumorigenesis. Differential expression of selected β-catenin/TCF-regulated genes, such as Myc, likely underlies context-dependent effects of Ctnnb1 gene dosage in tumorigenesis.
","Enhanced Wnt signaling contributes to colorectal and other cancers. β-catenin functions in Wnt signaling as a T cell factor (TCF) transcriptional co-activator. Previous studies showed specific β-catenin dosage favors Wnt signaling-dependent tumorigenesis for some tumor types. However, earlier studies emphasized the role of constitutional Ctnnb1 and Apc gene variations, rather than somatic gene targeting, and the work focused on small intestine tumors and no effects on colon tumor phenotypes were described. Furthermore, definitive insights were lacking into how reduced Ctnnb1 gene dosage affected Apc mutation-dependent tumorigenesis. Here, we show somatic inactivation of one Ctnnb1 allele dramatically inhibits mouse colon adenomatous polyposis induced by somatic bi-allelic Apc inactivation. In contrast, Ctnnb1 hemizygous inactivation does not affect mouse ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma development arising from Apc- and Pten-inactivation. Ctnnb1 hemizygous gene dose dramatically reduces the active pool of β-catenin, leading to the significant inhibition of β-catenin/TCF-regulated target gene expression, including those encoding key stem cell regulatory and crypt compartmentalization factors in colon epithelium. Tissue-specific differences for expression of selected β-catenin/TCF-regulated genes, such as Myc, may contribute to the context-dependent effects of Ctnnb1 gene dosage in Apc mutation-driven colon and ovarian tumors.

"The S-phase checkpoint plays an essential role in regulation of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity to maintain the dNTP pools. How eukaryotic cells respond appropriately to different levels of replication threats remains elusive. Here, we have identified that a conserved GSK-3 kinase Mck1 cooperates with Dun1 in regulating this process. Deleting MCK1 sensitizes dun1Δ to hydroxyurea (HU) reminiscent of mec1Δ or rad53Δ. While Mck1 is downstream of Rad53, it does not participate in the post-translational regulation of RNR as Dun1 does. Mck1 phosphorylates and releases the Crt1 repressor from the promoters of DNA damage-inducible genes as RNR2-4 and HUG1. Hug1, an Rnr2 inhibitor normally silenced, is induced as a counterweight to excessive RNR. When cells suffer a more severe threat, Mck1 inhibits HUG1 transcription. Consistently, only a combined deletion of HUG1 and CRT1, confers a dramatic boost of dNTP levels and the survival of mck1Δdun1Δ or mec1Δ cells assaulted by a lethal dose of HU. These findings reveal the division-of-labor between Mck1 and Dun1 at the S-phase checkpoint pathway to fine-tune dNTP homeostasis.
","The appropriate amount and balance of four dNTPs are crucial for all cells correctly copying and passing on their genetic material generation by generation. Eukaryotes have developed an alert and response system to deal with the disturbance. Here, we uncovered a second-level effector branch. It is activated by the upstream surveillance kinase cascade, which can induce the expression of dNTP-producing enzymes. It can also reduce the inhibitor of these enzymes to further boost their activity according to the degrees of threats. These findings suggest a multi-level response system to guarantee the appropriate dNTP supply, which is essential to maintain genetic stability under various environmental challenges.

"Disseminated histoplasmosis, a disease that often resembles and is mistaken for tuberculosis, is a major cause of death in patients with advanced HIV disease. Histoplasma antigen detection tests are an important addition to the diagnostic arsenal for patients with advanced HIV disease and should be considered for inclusion on the World Health Organization Essential Diagnostics List.
Our objective was to systematically review the literature to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Histoplasma antigen tests in the context of advanced HIV disease, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.
A systematic review of the published literature extracted data on comparator groups, type of histoplasmosis, HIV status, performance results, patient numbers, whether patients were consecutively enrolled or if the study used biobank samples. PubMed, Scopus, Lilacs and Scielo databases were searched for published articles between 1981 and 2018. There was no language restriction.
Of 1327 screened abstracts we included a total of 16 studies in humans for further analysis. Most studies included used a heterogeneousgroup of patients, often without HIV or mixing HIV and non HIV patients, with disseminated or non-disseminated forms of histoplasmosis. Six studies did not systematically use mycologically confirmed cases as a gold standard but compared antigen detection tests against another antigen detection test. Patient numbers were generally small (19–65) in individual studies and, in most (7/10), no confidence intervals were given. The post test probability of a positive or negative test were good suggesting that this non invasive diagnostic tool would be very useful for HIV care givers at the level of reference hospitals or hospitals with the infrastructure to perform ELISA tests. The first results evaluating point of care antigen detection tests using a lateral flow assay were promising with high sensitivity and specificity.
Antigen detection tests are promising tools to improve detection of and ultimately reduce the burden of histoplasmosis mortality in patients with advanced HIV disease.

"It is widely assumed that active RNA polymerases track along their templates to produce a transcript. We test this using chromosome conformation capture and human genes switched on rapidly and synchronously by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα); one is 221 kbp SAMD4A, which a polymerase takes more than 1 h to transcribe. Ten minutes after stimulation, the SAMD4A promoter comes together with other TNFα-responsive promoters. Subsequently, these contacts are lost as new downstream ones appear; contacts are invariably between sequences being transcribed. Super-resolution microscopy confirms that nascent transcripts (detected by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization) co-localize at relevant times. Results are consistent with an alternative view of transcription: polymerases fixed in factories reel in their respective templates, so different parts of the templates transiently lie together.
","We were all taught that an RNA polymerase becomes active by diffusing to a promoter, initiating transcription, and then tracking like a locomotive down the DNA template. We test this using tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) to switch on transcription of two human genes which lie far apart on the genetic map and then measure how close the two are in 3D nuclear space. If what we were taught were true, there is no reason to expect the two genes to lie together. What we find—using two different techniques (cutting/ligating nearby sequences, and super-resolution microscopy)—is that the two genes are initially apart; then the parts of the genes being transcribed at a particular moment transiently come into close proximity. Our results are consistent with a model in which genes diffuse to a cluster of polymerases—a transcription factory—with transcripts being made as immobile polymerases reel in their respective templates. The DNA moves, not the polymerase.

"N-terminal acetylation (N-Ac) is a highly abundant eukaryotic protein modification. Proteomics revealed a significant increase in the occurrence of N-Ac from lower to higher eukaryotes, but evidence explaining the underlying molecular mechanism(s) is currently lacking. We first analysed protein N-termini and their acetylation degrees, suggesting that evolution of substrates is not a major cause for the evolutionary shift in N-Ac. Further, we investigated the presence of putative N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) in higher eukaryotes. The purified recombinant human and Drosophila homologues of a novel NAT candidate was subjected to in vitro peptide library acetylation assays. This provided evidence for its NAT activity targeting Met-Lys- and other Met-starting protein N-termini, and the enzyme was termed Naa60p and its activity NatF. Its in vivo activity was investigated by ectopically expressing human Naa60p in yeast followed by N-terminal COFRADIC analyses. hNaa60p acetylated distinct Met-starting yeast protein N-termini and increased general acetylation levels, thereby altering yeast in vivo acetylation patterns towards those of higher eukaryotes. Further, its activity in human cells was verified by overexpression and knockdown of hNAA60 followed by N-terminal COFRADIC. NatF's cellular impact was demonstrated in Drosophila cells where NAA60 knockdown induced chromosomal segregation defects. In summary, our study revealed a novel major protein modifier contributing to the evolution of N-Ac, redundancy among NATs, and an essential regulator of normal chromosome segregation. With the characterization of NatF, the co-translational N-Ac machinery appears complete since all the major substrate groups in eukaryotes are accounted for.
","Small chemical groups are commonly attached to proteins in order to control their activity, localization, and stability. An abundant protein modification is N-terminal acetylation, in which an N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group to the very N-terminal amino acid of the protein. When going from lower to higher eukaryotes there is a significant increase in the occurrence of N-terminal acetylation. We demonstrate here that this is partly because higher eukaryotes uniquely express NatF, an enzyme capable of acetylating a large group of protein N-termini including those previously found to display an increased N-acetylation potential in higher eukaryotes. Thus, the current study has possibly identified the last major component of the eukaryotic machinery responsible for co-translational N-acetylation of proteins. All eukaryotic proteins start with methionine, which is co-translationally cleaved when the second amino acid is small. Thereafter, NatA may acetylate these newly exposed N-termini. Interestingly, NatF also has the potential to act on these types of N-termini where the methionine was not cleaved. At the cellular level, we further found that NatF is essential for normal chromosome segregation during cell division.

"The Toxoplasma gondii genome contains two aromatic amino acid hydroxylase genes, AAH1 and AAH2 encode proteins that produce L-DOPA, which can serve as a precursor of catecholamine neurotransmitters. It has been suggested that this pathway elevates host dopamine levels thus making infected rodents less fearful of their definitive Felidae hosts. However, L-DOPA is also a structural precursor of melanins, secondary quinones, and dityrosine protein crosslinks, which are produced by many species. For example, dityrosine crosslinks are abundant in the oocyst walls of Eimeria and T. gondii, although their structural role has not been demonstrated, Here, we investigated the biology of AAH knockout parasites in the sexual reproductive cycle within cats. We found that ablation of the AAH genes resulted in reduced infection in the cat, lower oocyst yields, and decreased rates of sporulation. Our findings suggest that the AAH genes play a predominant role during infection in the gut of the definitive feline host.
","Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that infects up to one-quarter of humans worldwide. Although it can infect virtually any warm-blooded animal, its definitive host is the cat where the sexual cycle occurs in enterocytes of the small intestine, producing microscopic, durable oocysts that are shed in feces and can remain infectious for extended periods of time in the environment. Two parasite genes, AAH1 and AAH2, code for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, which produce L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine. However, L-DOPA is also a precursor of other structural molecules including dityrosine, which may play a role in the wall of the oocyst. We investigated the effect of AAH deletion on the ability of the parasites to undergo sexual reproduction in cats, and found that AAH-deficient parasites were defective in their ability to produce oocysts, and those oocysts were partially defective in their ability to undergo maturation once produced. Collectively, these results suggest that the AAH genes play their primary role in transmission through the definitive host.

"The architectonic type principle relates patterns of cortico-cortical connectivity to the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions. One mechanism through which the observed close relation between cortical architecture and connectivity may be established is the joint development of cortical areas and their connections in developmental time windows. Here, we describe a theoretical exploration of the possible mechanistic underpinnings of the architectonic type principle, by performing systematic computational simulations of cortical development. The main component of our in silico model was a developing two-dimensional cortical sheet, which was gradually populated by neurons that formed cortico-cortical connections. To assess different explanatory mechanisms, we varied the spatiotemporal trajectory of the simulated neurogenesis. By keeping the rules governing axon outgrowth and connection formation constant across all variants of simulated development, we were able to create model variants which differed exclusively by the specifics of when and where neurons were generated. Thus, all differences in the resulting connectivity were due to the variations in spatiotemporal growth trajectories. Our results demonstrated that a prescribed targeting of interareal connection sites was not necessary for obtaining a realistic replication of the experimentally observed relation between connection patterns and architectonic differentiation. Instead, we found that spatiotemporal interactions within the forming cortical sheet were sufficient if a small number of empirically well-grounded assumptions were met, namely planar, expansive growth of the cortical sheet around two points of origin as neurogenesis progressed, stronger architectonic differentiation of cortical areas for later neurogenetic time windows, and stochastic connection formation. Thus, our study highlights a potential mechanism of how relative architectonic differentiation and cortical connectivity become linked during development. We successfully predicted connectivity in two species, cat and macaque, from simulated cortico-cortical connection networks, which further underscored the general applicability of mechanisms through which the architectonic type principle can explain cortical connectivity in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions.
","The mechanisms that govern the establishment of cortico-cortical connections during the development of the mammalian brain are poorly understood. In computational simulation experiments reported here, we explored the foundations of an architectonic type principle, which attributes adult cortical connectivity to the differences in architectonic differentiation between cortical areas. Architectonic differentiation refers, among other characteristics, to the cellular composition of cortical areas. This architectonic type principle has been found to account for diverse properties of cortical connectivity across mammalian species. Our in silico model generated connectivity patterns that were consistent with the architectonic type principle, as they are typically observed in mammalian cortices, if model settings were chosen such that they corresponded to empirical observations of cortical development. Our computational experiments systematically evaluated previously proposed mechanisms of cortical development and showed that connectivity consistent with the architectonic type principle arose only from realistic assumptions about the growth of the cortical sheet.

"Transmission is a matter of life or death for pathogen lineages and can therefore be considered as the main motor of their evolution. Gammaherpesviruses are archetypal pathogenic persistent viruses which have evolved to be transmitted in presence of specific immune response. Identifying their mode of transmission and their mechanisms of immune evasion is therefore essential to develop prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against these infections. As the known human gammaherpesviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus are host-specific and lack a convenient in vivo infection model; related animal gammaherpesviruses, such as murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68), are commonly used as general models of gammaherpesvirus infections in vivo. To date, it has however never been possible to monitor viral excretion or virus transmission of MHV-68 in laboratory mice population. In this study, we have used MHV-68 associated with global luciferase imaging to investigate potential excretion sites of this virus in laboratory mice. This allowed us to identify a genital excretion site of MHV-68 following intranasal infection and latency establishment in female mice. This excretion occurred at the external border of the vagina and was dependent on the presence of estrogens. However, MHV-68 vaginal excretion was not associated with vertical transmission to the litter or with horizontal transmission to female mice. In contrast, we observed efficient virus transmission to naïve males after sexual contact. In vivo imaging allowed us to show that MHV-68 firstly replicated in penis epithelium and corpus cavernosum before spreading to draining lymph nodes and spleen. All together, those results revealed the first experimental transmission model for MHV-68 in laboratory mice. In the future, this model could help us to better understand the biology of gammaherpesviruses and could also allow the development of strategies that could prevent the spread of these viruses in natural populations.
","Epstein-Barr virus and the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus are two human gammaherpesviruses which are linked to the development of several cancers. Efficient control of these infections is therefore of major interest, particularly in some epidemiological circumstances. These viruses are however host-specific and cannot be experimentally studied in vivo. The identification of a closely related viral species, called Murid herpesvirus 4 with the main strain called murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68), in wild rodents opened new horizons to the study of gammaherpesvirus biology. Surprisingly, despite 30 years of research, MHV-68 transmission had never been observed in captivity. In this study, using in vivo imaging, we showed that MHV-68 is genitally excreted after latency establishment in intranasally infected female mice. This allowed us to observe, for the first time, sexual transmission of MHV-68 between laboratory mice. In the future, this model should be important to better understand the biology of gammaherpesviruses and should also allow the development of strategies that could prevent the spread of these viruses in natural populations.

"The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P<0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P<0.0001 and P<0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.
","RNA viruses are the fastest evolving human pathogens, making their treatment and control difficult. Compared to DNA viruses, RNA viruses replicate with much lower fidelity, which can explain why RNA viruses evolve significantly faster than most DNA viruses. However, there is tremendous variation among the evolutionary rates of different RNA viruses, which is not explained by variation in mutation rates. Here we present a survey of mammalian RNA virus rates of evolution, and a comprehensive comparison of these rates to different properties of virus genomic architecture and ecology. We found that cell tropism is the most significant predictor of long-term rates of mammalian RNA virus evolution. For instance, viruses targeting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than viruses that target neurons. Our results provide mechanistic insight into why viruses that infect respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia have been difficult to control.

"Scabies is endemic in many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, with 69% of infants infected in the first year of life. We report the outcomes against scabies of two oral ivermectin mass drug administrations (MDAs) delivered 12 months apart in a remote Australian Aboriginal community.
Utilizing a before and after study design, we measured scabies prevalence through population census with sequential MDAs at baseline and month 12. Surveys at months 6 and 18 determined disease acquisition and treatment failures. Scabies infestations were diagnosed clinically with additional laboratory investigations for crusted scabies. Non-pregnant participants weighing ≥15 kg were administered a single 200 μg/kg ivermectin dose, repeated after 2–3 weeks if scabies was diagnosed, others followed a standard alternative algorithm.
We saw >1000 participants at each population census. Scabies prevalence fell from 4% at baseline to 1% at month 6. Prevalence rose to 9% at month 12 amongst the baseline cohort in association with an identified exposure to a presumptive crusted scabies case with a higher prevalence of 14% amongst new entries to the cohort. At month 18, scabies prevalence fell to 2%. Scabies acquisitions six months after each MDA were 1% and 2% whilst treatment failures were 6% and 5% respectively.
Scabies prevalence reduced in the six months after each MDA with a low risk of acquisition (1–2%). However, in a setting where living conditions are conducive to high scabies transmissibility, exposure to presumptive crusted scabies and population mobility, a sustained reduction in prevalence was not achieved.

"Scrub typhus is endemic in the Asia-Pacific region including China, and the number of reported cases has increased dramatically in the past decade. However, the spatial-temporal dynamics and the potential risk factors in transmission of scrub typhus in mainland China have yet to be characterized.
This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of reported scrub typhus cases in mainland China between January 2006 and December 2014, to detect the location of high risk spatiotemporal clusters of scrub typhus cases, and identify the potential risk factors affecting the re-emergence of the disease.
Monthly cases of scrub typhus reported at the county level between 2006 and 2014 were obtained from the Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention. Time-series analyses, spatiotemporal cluster analyses, and spatial scan statistics were used to explore the characteristics of the scrub typhus incidence. To explore the association between scrub typhus incidence and environmental variables panel Poisson regression analysis was conducted.
During the time period between 2006 and 2014 a total of 54,558 scrub typhus cases were reported in mainland China, which grew exponentially. The majority of cases were reported each year between July and November, with peak incidence during October every year. The spatiotemporal dynamics of scrub typhus varied over the study period with high-risk clusters identified in southwest, southern, and middle-eastern part of China. Scrub typhus incidence was positively correlated with the percentage of shrub and meteorological variables including temperature and precipitation.
The results of this study demonstrate areas in China that could be targeted with public health interventions to mitigate the growing threat of scrub typhus in the country.

"Lysozymes and hexosaminidases are ubiquitous hydrolases in bacteria and eukaryotes. In phagocytic lower eukaryotes and professional phagocytes from higher eukaryotes, they are involved in the degradation of ingested bacteria in phagosomes. In Entamoeba histolytica, which is the intestinal protozoan parasite that causes amoebiasis, phagocytosis plays a pivotal role in the nutrient acquisition and the evasion from the host defense systems. While the content of phagosomes and biochemical and physiological roles of the major phagosomal proteins have been established in E. histolytica, the mechanisms of trafficking of these phagosomal proteins, in general, remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized for the first time the putative receptor/carrier involved in the transport of the above-mentioned hydrolases to phagosomes. We have shown that the receptor, designated as cysteine protease binding protein family 8 (CPBF8), is localized in lysosomes and mediates transport of lysozymes and β-hexosaminidase α-subunit to phagosomes when the amoeba ingests mammalian cells or Gram-positive bacillus Clostridium perfringens. We have also shown that the binding of CPBF8 to the cargos is mediated by the serine-rich domain, more specifically three serine residues of the domain, which likely contains trifluoroacetic acid-sensitive O-phosphodiester-linked glycan modifications, of CPBF8. We further showed that the repression of CPBF8 by gene silencing reduced the lysozyme and β-hexosaminidase activity in phagosomes and delayed the degradation of C. perfringens. Repression of CPBF8 also resulted in decrease in the cytopathy against the mammalian cells, suggesting that CPBF8 may also be involved in, besides the degradation of ingested bacteria, the pathogenesis against the mammalian hosts. This work represents the first case of the identification of a transport receptor of hydrolytic enzymes responsible for the degradation of microorganisms in phagosomes.
","Phagocytosis is the cellular process of engulfing solid particles to form an internal phagosome in protozoa, algae, and professional phagocytes of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. In phagocytic protozoa, phagocytosis is involved in the acquisition of nutrients, and the evasion from the host immune system and inflammation. While hydrolytic enzymes that are essential for the efficient and regulated degradation of phagocytosed particles, such as bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotic organisms, have been characterized, the mechanisms of the transport of these proteins are poorly understood. In the present study, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the molecular mechanisms of how the digestive enzymes are transported to phagosomes. Understanding of such mechanisms of the transport of phagosomal proteins at the molecular level may lead to the identification of a novel target for the development of new preventive measures against parasitic infections caused by phagocytic protozoa.

"Buruli ulcer (BU), caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, is a debilitating disease of the skin and underlying tissue. The first phase of a BU prevention and treatment programme (BUPaT) was initiated from 2005–2008, in the Ga-West and Ga-South municipalities in Ghana to increase access to BU treatment and to improve early case detection and case management. This paper assesses achievements of the BUPaT programme and lessons learnt. It also considers the impact of the programme on broader interests of the health system.
A mixed-methods approach included patients' records review, review of programme reports, a stakeholder forum, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, clinic visits and observations.
Extensive collaboration existed across all levels, (national, municipality, and community), thus strengthening the health system. The programme enhanced capacities of all stakeholders in various aspects of health services delivery and demonstrated the importance of health education and community-based surveillance to create awareness and encourage early treatment. A patient database was also created using recommended World Health Organisation (WHO) forms which showed that 297 patients were treated from 2005–2008. The proportion of patients requiring only antibiotic treatment, introduced in the course of the programme, was highest in the last year (35.4% in the first, 23.5% in the second and 42.5% in the third year). Early antibiotic treatment prevented recurrences which was consistent with programme aims.
To improve early case management of BU, strengthening existing clinics to increase access to antibiotic therapy is critical. Intensifying health education and surveillance would ultimately increase early reporting and treatment for all cases. Further research is needed to explain the role of environmental factors for BU contagion. Programme strategies reported in our study: collaboration among stakeholders, health education, community surveillance and regular antibiotic treatment can be adopted for any BU-endemic area in Ghana.
","Buruli ulcer (BU), caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, is a debilitating disease of the skin and underlying tissue which starts as a painless nodule, oedema or plaque and could develop into painful and massive ulcers if left untreated. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, the study assessed the effectiveness of the BUPaT programme to improve early detection and management of BU in an endemic area in Ghana. The results of the study showed extensive collaboration across all levels, (national, municipality and community), which contributed to strengthening the programme. Health staff were trained to manage all BU cases. School teachers, municipal environmental staff and community surveillance volunteers were trained to give the right health messages, screen for detection of early cases and refer for medical treatment. WHO-recommended antibiotics improved treatment and cure, particularly for early lesions, and prevented recurrences. Improving access to antibiotic treatment is critical for early case management. Health education is required to emphasise the effectiveness of treatment with antibiotics to reduce deformities and the importance of seeking medical treatment for all skin lesions. Further research is needed to explain the role of environmental factors in BU contagion.

"Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular bacterium that lives in aquatic environments where it parasitizes amoeba. However, upon inhalation of contaminated aerosols it can infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages, which can result in Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia. Upon experimental airway infection of mice, L. pneumophila is rapidly controlled by innate immune mechanisms. Here we identified, on a cell-type specific level, the key innate effector functions responsible for rapid control of infection. In addition to the well-characterized NLRC4-NAIP5 flagellin recognition pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also essential for effective innate immune control of L. pneumophila. While ROS are essential for the bactericidal activity of neutrophils, alveolar macrophages (AM) rely on neutrophil and monocyte-derived TNF signaling via TNFR1 to restrict bacterial replication. This TNF-mediated antibacterial mechanism depends on the acidification of lysosomes and their fusion with L. pneumophila containing vacuoles (LCVs), as well as caspases with a minor contribution from cysteine-type cathepsins or calpains, and is independent of NLRC4, caspase-1, caspase-11 and NOX2. This study highlights the differential utilization of innate effector pathways to curtail intracellular bacterial replication in specific host cells upon L. pneumophila airway infection.
","Legionella pneumophila is a motile gram-negative bacterium found mainly in fresh water environments where it replicates in amoeba. It uses a molecular syringe to inject effector molecules into these predatory host cells, reprograming them to support L. pneumophila growth. Upon inhalation of contaminated aerosols, L. pneumophila uses the same approach to replicate in human alveolar macrophages, which can result in a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease. However, L. pneumophila is normally controlled by the innate immune system, and the key mechanisms and cells involved in this immune response remain unclear. Here we show that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dominant role in the clearance of L. pneumophila from the lung. Neutrophils kill L. pneumophila using ROS, while alveolar macrophages are activated by TNF produced by neutrophils and monocytes that are recruited to the lung. TNF-activated alveolar macrophages kill L. pneumophila by recruiting lysosomes and acidifying L. pneumophila containing vacuoles. Caspases other than caspase-1 and 11 are involved in this mechanism, with a minor contribution from cysteine-type cathepsins or calpains. This study deepens our understanding of the mechanisms by which TNF contributes to the control of intracellular pathogens, and highlights the key elements of the innate immune response to L. pneumophila lung infection.

"Individual perception of vaccine safety is an important factor in determining a person's adherence to a vaccination program and its consequences for disease control. This perception, or belief, about the safety of a given vaccine is not a static parameter but a variable subject to environmental influence. To complicate matters, perception of risk (or safety) does not correspond to actual risk. In this paper we propose a way to include the dynamics of such beliefs into a realistic epidemiological model, yielding a more complete depiction of the mechanisms underlying the unraveling of vaccination campaigns. The methodology proposed is based on Bayesian inference and can be extended to model more complex belief systems associated with decision models. We found the method is able to produce behaviors which approximate what has been observed in real vaccine and disease scare situations. The framework presented comprises a set of useful tools for an adequate quantitative representation of a common yet complex public-health issue. These tools include representation of beliefs as Bayesian probabilities, usage of logarithmic pooling to combine probability distributions representing opinions, and usage of natural conjugate priors to efficiently compute the Bayesian posterior. This approach allowed a comprehensive treatment of the uncertainty regarding vaccination behavior in a realistic epidemiological model.
","A frequently made assumption in population models is that individuals make decisions in a standard way, which tends to be fixed and set according to the modeler's view on what is the most likely way individuals should behave. In this paper we acknowledge the importance of modeling behavioral changes (in the form of beliefs/opinions) as a dynamic variable in the model. We also propose a way of mathematically modeling dynamic belief updates which is based on the very well established concept of a belief as a probability distribution and its temporal evolution as a direct application of the Bayes theorem. We also propose the use of logarithmic pooling as an optimal way of combining different opinions which must be considered when making a decision. To argue for the relevance of this issue, we present a model of vaccinating behaviour with dynamic belief updates, modeled after real scenarios of vaccine and disease scare recorded in the recent literature.

"Microsporidia comprise a phylum of over 1400 species of obligate intracellular pathogens that can infect almost all animals, but little is known about the host response to these parasites. Here we use the whole-animal host C. elegans to show an in vivo role for ubiquitin-mediated response to the microsporidian species Nematocida parisii, as well to the Orsay virus, another natural intracellular pathogen of C. elegans. We analyze gene expression of C. elegans in response to N. parisii, and find that it is similar to response to viral infection. Notably, we find an upregulation of SCF ubiquitin ligase components, such as the cullin ortholog cul-6, which we show is important for ubiquitin targeting of N. parisii cells in the intestine. We show that ubiquitylation components, the proteasome, and the autophagy pathway are all important for defense against N. parisii infection. We also find that SCF ligase components like cul-6 promote defense against viral infection, where they have a more robust role than against N. parisii infection. This difference may be due to suppression of the host ubiquitylation system by N. parisii: when N. parisii is crippled by anti-microsporidia drugs, the host can more effectively target pathogen cells for ubiquitylation. Intriguingly, inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) increases expression of infection-upregulated SCF ligase components, indicating that a trigger for transcriptional response to intracellular infection by N. parisii and virus may be perturbation of the UPS. Altogether, our results demonstrate an in vivo role for ubiquitin-mediated defense against microsporidian and viral infections in C. elegans.
","Microbial pathogens have two distinct lifestyles: some pathogens live outside of host cells, and others live inside of host cells and are called intracellular pathogens. Microsporidia are fungal-related intracellular pathogens that can infect all animals, but are poorly understood. We used the roundworm C. elegans as a host to show that ubiquitin pathways provide defense against both a natural microsporidian infection of C. elegans, as well as a natural viral infection. Our study shows that ubiquitin, the proteasome and autophagy components are all important to control intracellular infection in C. elegans, although microsporidia seem to partially evade this defense. We also show that SCF ubiquitin ligases help control both microsporidia and virus infection. Furthermore, we find that C. elegans upregulates expression of SCF ligases when ubiquitin-related degradation machinery is inhibited, indicating that C. elegans monitors the functioning of this core cellular process and upregulates ligase expression when it is perturbed. Altogether, our findings describe ubiquitin-mediated pathways that are involved in host response and defense against intracellular pathogens, and how this machinery is regulated by infection to increase defense against intracellular pathogens such as microsporidia and viruses.

                        decades due to migration to other parts of the world, including Spain. We
                        studied the prevalence of Chagas disease in Latin American patients treated
                        at a health center in Barcelona and evaluated its clinical phase. We make
                        some recommendations for screening for the disease.
We performed an observational, cross-sectional prevalence study by means of
                        an immunochromatographic test screening of all continental Latin American
                        patients over the age of 14 years visiting the health centre from October
                        2007 to October 2009. The diagnosis was confirmed by serological methods:
                        conventional in-house ELISA (cELISA), a commercial kit (rELISA) and ELISA
                        using T cruzi lysate (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics) (oELISA).
                        Of 766 patients studied, 22 were diagnosed with T. cruzi
                        infection, showing a prevalence of 2.87% (95% CI,
                        1.6–4.12%). Of the infected patients, 45.45% men and
                        54.55% women, 21 were from Bolivia, showing a prevalence in the
                        Bolivian subgroup (n = 127) of 16.53%
                        (95% CI, 9.6–23.39%).
All the infected patients were in a chronic phase of Chagas disease:
                        81% with the indeterminate form, 9.5% with the cardiac form
                        and 9.5% with the cardiodigestive form. All patients infected with
                            T. cruzi had heard of Chagas disease in their country
                        of origin, 82% knew someone affected, and 77% had a
                        significant history of living in adobe houses in rural areas.
We found a high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in
                        immigrants from Bolivia. Detection of T.
                        cruzi–infected persons by screening programs in non-endemic
                        countries would control non-vectorial transmission and would benefit the
                        persons affected, public health and national health systems.
","Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan
                        Trypanosoma cruzi, and is becoming an emerging health
                    problem in non-endemic areas because of growing population movements. The
                    clinical manifestations of chronic T. cruzi infection include
                    the latent form (the indeterminate chronic form), the cardiac form, the
                    digestive or cardiodigestive form, and sudden death. Therefore, many diagnoses
                    of Chagas disease are based on epidemiological suspicion rather than on clinical
                    signs and symptoms. This study showed that the prevalence of Chagas disease in
                    Latin American patients attending at a health center in Barcelona is
                    2,87% and the highest prevalence was found among Bolivian patients
                    (16,53%). All the infected patients were in a chronic phase of Chagas
                    disease. Detection of T. cruzi–infected persons by
                    screening programs in non-endemic countries would control non-vectorial
                    transmission and would benefit the persons affected, public health and national
                    health systems. The data obtained in this study and the experiences described
                    elsewhere suggest that it is advisable to perform Chagas disease screening in
                    non-endemic countries on all patients from continental Latin America who:
                    (1)have a suggestive epidemiologic history, (2)are pregnant, (3)are
                    immunosuppressed, (4)have symptoms suggestive of Chagas disease, or (5)request
                    screening.

"Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) regulate mRNA fate by controlling stability and translation through interactions with both the poly(A) tail and eIF4F complex. Many organisms have several paralogs of PABPs and eIF4F complex components and it is likely that different eIF4F/PABP complex combinations regulate distinct sets of mRNAs. Trypanosomes have five eIF4G paralogs, six of eIF4E and two PABPs, PABP1 and PABP2. Under starvation, polysomes dissociate and the majority of mRNAs, most translation initiation factors and PABP2 reversibly localise to starvation stress granules. To understand this more broadly we identified a protein interaction cohort for both T. brucei PABPs by cryo-mill/affinity purification-mass spectrometry. PABP1 very specifically interacts with the previously identified interactors eIF4E4 and eIF4G3 and few others. In contrast PABP2 is promiscuous, with a larger set of interactors including most translation initiation factors and most prominently eIF4G1, with its two partners TbG1-IP and TbG1-IP2. Only RBP23 was specific to PABP1, whilst 14 RNA-binding proteins were exclusively immunoprecipitated with PABP2. Significantly, PABP1 and associated proteins are largely excluded from starvation stress granules, but PABP2 and most interactors translocate to granules on starvation. We suggest that PABP1 regulates a small subpopulation of mainly small-sized mRNAs, as it interacts with a small and distinct set of proteins unable to enter the dominant pathway into starvation stress granules and localises preferentially to a subfraction of small polysomes. By contrast PABP2 likely regulates bulk mRNA translation, as it interacts with a wide range of proteins, enters stress granules and distributes over the full range of polysomes.
","Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) bind to the poly(A) tails of eukaryotic mRNAs and function in regulating mRNA fate. Many eukaryotes have several PABP paralogs and the current view is that each PABP binds a specific subset of mRNAs. Trypanosoma brucei has two PABPs, and to understand the differential functionality of these paralogs we identified interacting proteins for each. We found unique interactors for both PABPs, and significant differences between the two interaction cohorts. Our data indicate that the two PABP paralogs of trypanosomes have very distinct roles in mediating mRNA fate.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection develops into chronicity in 80% of all patients, characterized by persistent low-level replication. To understand how the virus establishes its tightly controlled intracellular RNA replication cycle, we developed the first detailed mathematical model of the initial dynamic phase of the intracellular HCV RNA replication. We therefore quantitatively measured viral RNA and protein translation upon synchronous delivery of viral genomes to host cells, and thoroughly validated the model using additional, independent experiments. Model analysis was used to predict the efficacy of different classes of inhibitors and identified sensitive substeps of replication that could be targeted by current and future therapeutics. A protective replication compartment proved to be essential for sustained RNA replication, balancing translation versus replication and thus effectively limiting RNA amplification. The model predicts that host factors involved in the formation of this compartment determine cellular permissiveness to HCV replication. In gene expression profiling, we identified several key processes potentially determining cellular HCV replication efficiency.
","Hepatitis C is a severe disease and a prime cause for liver transplantation. Up to 3% of the world's population are chronically infected with its causative agent, the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). This capacity to establish long (decades) lasting persistent infection sets HCV apart from other plus-strand RNA viruses typically causing acute, self-limiting infections. A prerequisite for its capacity to persist is HCV's complex and tightly regulated intracellular replication strategy. In this study, we therefore wanted to develop a comprehensive understanding of the molecular processes governing HCV RNA replication in order to pinpoint the most vulnerable substeps in the viral life cycle. For that purpose, we used a combination of biological experiments and mathematical modeling. Using the model to study HCV's replication strategy, we recognized diverse but crucial roles for the membraneous replication compartment of HCV in regulating RNA amplification. We further predict the existence of an essential limiting host factor (or function) required for establishing active RNA replication and thereby determining cellular permissiveness for HCV. Our model also proved valuable to understand and predict the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of HCV and might be a solid basis for the development of similar models for other plus-strand RNA viruses.

"Viroporins like influenza A virus M2, hepatitis C virus p7, HIV-1 Vpu and picornavirus 2B associate with host membranes, and create hydrophilic corridors, which are critical for viral entry, replication and egress. The 6K proteins from alphaviruses are conjectured to be viroporins, essential during egress of progeny viruses from host membranes, although the analogue in Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) remains relatively uncharacterized. Using a combination of electrophysiology, confocal and electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations we show for the first time that CHIKV 6K is an ion channel forming protein that primarily associates with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. The ion channel activity of 6K can be inhibited by amantadine, an antiviral developed against the M2 protein of Influenza A virus; and CHIKV infection of cultured cells can be effectively inhibited in presence of this drug. Our study provides crucial mechanistic insights into the functionality of 6K during CHIKV-host interaction and suggests that 6K is a potential therapeutic drug target, with amantadine and its derivatives being strong candidates for further development.
","Chikungunya fever is a severe crippling illness caused by the arthropod-borne virus CHIKV. Originally from the African subcontinent, the virus has now spread worldwide and is responsible for substantial morbidity and economic loss. The existing treatment against CHIKV is primarily symptomatic, and it is imperative that specific therapeutics be devised. The present study provides detailed insight into the functionality of 6K, an ion channel forming protein of CHIKV. Amantadine, a known antiviral against influenza virus, also inhibits CHIKV replication in cell culture and drastically alters the morphology of virus particles. This work highlights striking parallels among functionalities of virus-encoded membrane-interacting proteins, which may be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antivirals.

"During the first meiotic prophase, programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are distributed non randomly at hotspots along chromosomes, to initiate recombination. In all organisms, more DSBs are formed than crossovers (CO), the repair product that creates a physical link between homologs and allows their correct segregation. It is not known whether all DSB hotspots are also CO hotspots or if the CO/DSB ratio varies with the chromosomal location. Here, we investigated the variations in the CO/DSB ratio by mapping genome-wide the binding sites of the Zip3 protein during budding yeast meiosis. We show that Zip3 associates with DSB sites that are engaged in repair by CO, and Zip3 enrichment at DSBs reflects the DSB tendency to be repaired by CO. Moreover, the relative amount of Zip3 per DSB varies with the chromosomal location, and specific chromosomal features are associated with high or low Zip3 per DSB. This work shows that DSB hotspots are not necessarily CO hotspots and suggests that different categories of DSB sites may fulfill different functions.
","For sexual reproduction, meiosis is an essential step ensuring the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursors of the germline. This reduction in the genome's content is achieved through a specialized type of division, where a single round of DNA replication is followed by two successive rounds of chromosome segregation. The first round separates the homologs. For this to faithfully occur, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and experience recombination, catalyzed by the formation of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs). Upon their repair, a subset of DSBs will generate crossovers, which result from an intermediate that creates a physical link between homologs and allows their correct segregation by the meiotic spindle. DSBs, as well as crossovers, do not occur randomly along chromosomes but at preferential places called hotspots. To ask if all DSB hotspots also give rise to high crossover frequency, we have systematically compared the map of DSBs with that of a protein, Zip3, which we show preferentially binds to DSB sites that are being repaired with a crossover. We discovered that several DSB hotspots rarely produce crossovers, meaning that the decision to repair a DSB with a crossover can be influenced by specific chromosomal features.

"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the most severe form of leishmaniasis, is endemic in Europe with Mediterranean countries reporting endemic status alongside a worrying northward spread. Serological diagnosis, including immunochromatographic test based on the recombinant antigen rK39 (rK39-ICT) and a direct agglutination test (DAT) based on the whole parasite antigen, have been validated in regions with high VL burden, such as eastern Africa and the Indian subcontinent. To date, no studies using a large set of patients have performed an assessment of both methods within Europe.
We selected a range of clinical serum samples from patients with confirmed VL (including HIV co-infection), Chagas disease, malaria, other parasitic infections and negative samples (n = 743; years 2009–2015) to test the performance of rK39-ICT rapid test (Kalazar Detect Rapid Test; InBios International, Inc., USA) and DAT (ITM-DAT/VLG; Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp, Belgium). An in-house immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), was included for comparison. Estimated sensitivities for rK39-ICT and DAT in HIV-negative VL patients were 83.1% [75.1–91.2] and 84.2% [76.3–92.1], respectively. Sensitivity was reduced to 67.3% [52.7–82.0] for rK39 and increased to 91.3% [82.1–100.0] for DAT in HIV/VL co-infected patients. The in-house IFAT was more sensitive in HIV-negative VL patients, 84.2% [76.3–92.1] than in HIV/VL patients, 79.4% [73.3–96.2]. DAT gave 32 false positives in sera from HIV-negative VL suspects, compared to 0 and 2 for rK39 and IFAT, respectively, but correctly detected more HIV/VL patients (42/46) than rK39 (31/46) and IFAT (39/46).
Though rK39-ICT and DAT exhibited acceptable sensitivity and specificity a combination with other tests is required for highly sensitive diagnosis of VL cases in Spain. Important variation in the performance of the tests were seen in patients co-infected with HIV or with other parasitic infections. This study can help inform the choice of serological test to be used when screening or diagnosing VL in a European Mediterranean setting.
","Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of leishmaniasis, a disease transmitted through the bite of an infected sandfly. Although the biggest burden of leishmaniasis is in eastern Africa and the Indian subcontinent, the disease is also endemic in parts of Europe. Previous studies have looked at performance of diagnostic methods, but not in great detail on samples derived from a European setting. Using a large set of samples from a national reference laboratory in Madrid, Spain, we assessed a leishmaniasis rapid test and a direct agglutination test for serological diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in Europe. Both tests were effective at diagnosing VL, but important differences were seen when testing patients co-infected with HIV or with other parasitic infections. This study can help inform which diagnostic tests are suitable for use in a European Mediterranean setting.

"Coral snakes of the genus Micrurus have a high diversity and wide distribution in the Americas. Despite envenomings by these animals being uncommon, accidents are often severe and may result in death. Producing an antivenom to treat these envenomings has been challenging since coral snakes are difficult to catch, produce small amounts of venom, and the antivenoms produced have shown limited cross neutralization. Here we present data of cross neutralization among monovalent antivenoms raised against M. dumerilii, M. isozonus, M. mipartitus and M. surinamensis and the development of a new polyvalent coral snake antivenom, resulting from the mix of monovalent antivenoms. Our results, show that this coral snake antivenom has high neutralizing potency and wide taxonomic coverage, constituting a possible alternative for a long sought Pan-American coral snake antivenom.
","Coral snakes are distributed in the Americas form Southern United States to Argentina. These snakes cause envenomings that, despite not being common, often lead to death. The antivenoms currently produced to treat accidents caused by these snakes have limitations regarding the number of species venoms they could neutralize. Here, we present an antivenom with a wide spectrum of neutralization, when compared to other Anticoral antivenoms. Nevertheless, more studies are still necessary to evaluate its neutralization capacity against the venoms of other species. This antivenom has great potential, as it neutralizes the lethal effects of some of the most common Micrurus species in the Americas.

"The small size of RNA virus genomes (2-to-32 kb) has been attributed to high mutation rates during replication, which is thought to lack proof-reading. This paradigm is being revisited owing to the discovery of a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nidoviruses, a monophyletic group of positive-stranded RNA viruses with a conserved genome architecture. ExoN, a homolog of canonical DNA proof-reading enzymes, is exclusively encoded by nidoviruses with genomes larger than 20 kb. All other known non-segmented RNA viruses have smaller genomes. Here we use evolutionary analyses to show that the two- to three-fold expansion of the nidovirus genome was accompanied by a large number of replacements in conserved proteins at a scale comparable to that in the Tree of Life. To unravel common evolutionary patterns in such genetically diverse viruses, we established the relation between genomic regions in nidoviruses in a sequence alignment-free manner. We exploited the conservation of the genome architecture to partition each genome into five non-overlapping regions: 5′ untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame (ORF) 1a, ORF1b, 3′ORFs (encompassing the 3′-proximal ORFs), and 3′ UTR. Each region was analyzed for its contribution to genome size change under different models. The non-linear model statistically outperformed the linear one and captured >92% of data variation. Accordingly, nidovirus genomes were concluded to have reached different points on an expansion trajectory dominated by consecutive increases of ORF1b, ORF1a, and 3′ORFs. Our findings indicate a unidirectional hierarchical relation between these genome regions, which are distinguished by their expression mechanism. In contrast, these regions cooperate bi-directionally on a functional level in the virus life cycle, in which they predominantly control genome replication, genome expression, and virus dissemination, respectively. Collectively, our findings suggest that genome architecture and the associated region-specific division of labor leave a footprint on genome expansion and may limit RNA genome size.
","RNA viruses include many major pathogens. The adaptation of viruses to their hosts is facilitated by fast mutation and constrained by small genome sizes, which are both due to the extremely high error rate of viral polymerases. Using an innovative computational approach, we now provide evidence for additional forces that may control genome size and, consequently, affect virus adaptation to the host. We analyzed nidoviruses, a monophyletic group of viruses that populate the upper ∼60% of the RNA virus genome size scale. They evolved a conserved genomic architecture, and infect vertebrate and invertebrate species. Those nidoviruses that have the largest known RNA genomes uniquely encode a 3′-to-5′exoribonuclease, a homolog of canonical DNA proof-reading enzymes that improves their replication fidelity. We show that nidoviruses accumulated mutations on par with that observed in the Tree of Life for comparable protein datasets, although the time scale of nidovirus evolution remains unknown. Extant nidovirus genomes of different size reached particular points on a common trajectory of genome expansion. This trajectory may be shaped by the division of labor between open reading frames that predominantly control genome replication, genome expression, and virus dissemination, respectively. Ultimately, genomic architecture may determine the observed genome size limit in contemporary RNA viruses.

"Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas’ disease, affects 8 million people predominantly living in socioeconomic underdeveloped areas. T. cruzi trypomastigotes (Ty), the classical infective stage, interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM), an obligatory step before invasion of almost all mammalian cells in different tissues. Here we have characterized the proteome and phosphoproteome of T. cruzi trypomastigotes upon interaction with ECM (MTy) and the data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010970. Proteins involved with metabolic processes (such as the glycolytic pathway), kinases, flagellum and microtubule related proteins, transport-associated proteins and RNA/DNA binding elements are highly represented in the pool of proteins modified by phosphorylation. Further, important metabolic switches triggered by this interaction with ECM were indicated by decreases in the phosphorylation of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoglucomutase, phosphoglycerate kinase in MTy. Concomitantly, a decrease in the pyruvate and lactate and an increase of glucose and succinate contents were detected by GC-MS. These observations led us to focus on the changes in the glycolytic pathway upon binding of the parasite to the ECM. Inhibition of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in MTy were observed and this correlated with the phosphorylation levels of the respective enzymes. Putative kinases involved in protein phosphorylation altered upon parasite incubation with ECM were suggested by in silico analysis. Taken together, our results show that in addition to cytoskeletal changes and protease activation, a reprogramming of the trypomastigote metabolism is triggered by the interaction of the parasite with the ECM prior to cell invasion and differentiation into amastigotes, the multiplicative intracellular stage of T. cruzi in the vertebrate host.
","Adhesion of Trypanosoma cruzi to distinct elements of ECM involving different surface proteins from the infective stage of the parasite has been described. Despite the relevance of ECM for T. cruzi infection, the signaling pathways triggered in trypomastigotes upon interactions with ECM are less well understood. In previous work we demonstrated the dephosphorylation of proteins, such as α-tubulin, paraflagellar rod proteins and ERK 1/2 in trypomastigotes incubated with either laminin or fibronectin. Further, we described changes in the S-nitrosylation and nitration pattern of proteins from trypomastigote incubated with ECM. To expand our knowledge on ECM triggered parasite signaling we applied quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies to trypomastigotes incubated with ECM (MTy) compared to controls (Ty). Our results indicate relevant changes in total protein and phosphoprotein profiles in MTy. The kinases implicated in the modifications were suggested by bioinformatic analyses, as well as the number of modifications and the frequency of amino acids per peptide that have been modified. Proteins involved in metabolic processes, including enzymes from the glycolytic pathway, phosphatases and kinases were the most representative groups among the proteins modified by phosphorylation. Quantification of metabolites in MTy and Ty also indicated that glucose metabolism is impaired in trypomastigotes incubated with ECM. The significant inhibition of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in MTy associated with phosphorylation levels, strongly suggests that trypomastigotes reprogram their metabolism in response to interaction with the extracellular matrix, an obligatory step prior to host cell invasion.

"The existence of viral variants that escape from the selection pressures imposed by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in HIV-1 infection is well documented, but it is unclear when they arise, with reported measures of the time to escape in individuals ranging from days to years. A study of participants enrolled in the SPARTAC (Short Pulse Anti-Retroviral Therapy at HIV Seroconversion) clinical trial allowed direct observation of the evolution of CTL escape variants in 125 adults with primary HIV-1 infection observed for up to three years. Patient HLA-type, longitudinal CD8+ T-cell responses measured by IFN-γ ELISpot and longitudinal HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef sequence data were used to study the timing and prevalence of CTL escape in the participants whilst untreated. Results showed that sequence variation within CTL epitopes at the first time point (within six months of the estimated date of seroconversion) was consistent with most mutations being transmitted in the infecting viral strain rather than with escape arising within the first few weeks of infection. Escape arose throughout the first three years of infection, but slowly and steadily. Approximately one third of patients did not drive any new escape in an HLA-restricted epitope in just under two years. Patients driving several escape mutations during these two years were rare and the median and modal numbers of new escape events in each patient were one and zero respectively. Survival analysis of time to escape found that possession of a protective HLA type significantly reduced time to first escape in a patient (p = 0.01), and epitopes escaped faster in the face of a measurable CD8+ ELISpot response (p = 0.001). However, even in an HLA matched host who mounted a measurable, specific, CD8+ response the average time before the targeted epitope evolved an escape mutation was longer than two years.
","The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) arm of the immune response is thought to play a significant role in the control of HIV-1 infection. Mutations within the HIV-1 genome allow the virus to escape recognition by CTLs and so evade the immune response. These escape mutations have been well documented but observed waiting times to escape within an individual have ranged from days to years. Many studies describing CTL escape have taken a detailed look at a few patients. Our analysis is based on a cohort of 125 clinical trial participants with immunologic and viral sequence data taken at regular longitudinal time points within the first few years of infection. Results suggested that the majority of CTL-related mutations present early in infection had been transmitted in the infecting viral strain as opposed to arising in the new host due to selection pressure imposed by CTLs. Whilst the prevalence of CTL escape mutations in the dataset was high, the incidence of new escape was relatively low; around one third of patients did not drive an escape within the first two years. Patients possessing a ‘protective’ HLA genotype had a significantly shorter waiting time to first escape than those without.

"Modulation of host cell function is vital for intracellular pathogens to survive and replicate within host cells. Most commonly, these pathogens utilize specialized secretion systems to inject substrates (also called effector proteins) that function as toxins within host cells. Since it would be detrimental for an intracellular pathogen to immediately kill its host cell, it is essential that secreted toxins be inactivated or degraded after they have served their purpose. The pathogen Legionella pneumophila represents an ideal system to study interactions between toxins as it survives within host cells for approximately a day and its Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4SS) injects a vast number of toxins. Previously we reported that the Dot/Icm substrates SidE, SdeA, SdeB, and SdeC (known as the SidE family of effectors) are secreted into host cells, where they localize to the cytoplasmic face of the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV) in the early stages of infection. SidJ, another effector that is unrelated to the SidE family, is also encoded in the sdeC-sdeA locus. Interestingly, while over-expression of SidE family proteins in a wild type Legionella strain has no effect, we found that their over-expression in a ∆sidJ mutant completely inhibits intracellular growth of the strain. In addition, we found expression of SidE proteins is toxic in both yeast and mammalian HEK293 cells, but this toxicity can be suppressed by co-expression of SidJ, suggesting that SidJ may modulate the function of SidE family proteins. Finally, we were able to demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro that SidJ acts on SidE proteins to mediate their disappearance from the LCV, thereby preventing lethal intoxication of host cells. Based on these findings, we propose that SidJ acts as a metaeffector to control the activity of other Legionella effectors.
","A key attribute of many pathogens is their ability to survive and replicate within eukaryotic host cells. One such pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, is able to grow within macrophages in the lungs, thereby causing a form of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ Disease. L. pneumophila causes disease by translocating several hundred proteins into the host cell. These proteins are typically referred to as ‘‘effectors’’, as they function as toxins to alter normal host cell function. However, since L. pneumophila remains within the host cells for approximately one day, continual poisoning of the eukaryotic cells by the bacterial effectors will result in the premature death of the host cell, thus restricting the growth of the pathogen. Previously the L. pneumophila secreted protein LubX was described as a “metaeffector”, which has been defined as an effector that acts directly on another effector to modulate its function inside the host cell. LubX accomplishes this task by directing the degradation of another effector, SidH. Here we report a second L. pneumophila metaeffector, SidJ, acts in a similar manner to neutralize SidE family effectors by removing them from the intracellular compartment that contains the bacterium. This further establishes the concept of metaeffectors, which are likely to be critical to how Legionella and many other pathogens cause disease.

"Recent years have seen progress in the development of statistically rigorous frameworks to infer outbreak transmission trees (“who infected whom”) from epidemiological and genetic data. Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks, and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent methodological developments.

"Accurate and reliable forecasts of seasonal epidemics of infectious disease can assist in the design of countermeasures and increase public awareness and preparedness. This article describes two main contributions we made recently toward this goal: a novel approach to probabilistic modeling of surveillance time series based on “delta densities”, and an optimization scheme for combining output from multiple forecasting methods into an adaptively weighted ensemble. Delta densities describe the probability distribution of the change between one observation and the next, conditioned on available data; chaining together nonparametric estimates of these distributions yields a model for an entire trajectory. Corresponding distributional forecasts cover more observed events than alternatives that treat the whole season as a unit, and improve upon multiple evaluation metrics when extracting key targets of interest to public health officials. Adaptively weighted ensembles integrate the results of multiple forecasting methods, such as delta density, using weights that can change from situation to situation. We treat selection of optimal weightings across forecasting methods as a separate estimation task, and describe an estimation procedure based on optimizing cross-validation performance. We consider some details of the data generation process, including data revisions and holiday effects, both in the construction of these forecasting methods and when performing retrospective evaluation. The delta density method and an adaptively weighted ensemble of other forecasting methods each improve significantly on the next best ensemble component when applied separately, and achieve even better cross-validated performance when used in conjunction. We submitted real-time forecasts based on these contributions as part of CDC’s 2015/2016 FluSight Collaborative Comparison. Among the fourteen submissions that season, this system was ranked by CDC as the most accurate.
","Seasonal influenza is associated with 250 000 to 500 000 deaths worldwide each year (WHO estimates). In the United States and other temperate regions, seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually, but their timing and intensity varies significantly; accurate and reliable forecasts that quantify their uncertainty can assist policymakers when planning countermeasures such as vaccination campaigns, and increase awareness and preparedness of hospitals and the general public. Starting with the 2013/2014 flu season, CDC has solicited, collected, evaluated, and compared weekly forecasts from external research groups. We developed a new method for forecasting flu surveillance data, which stitches together models of changes that happen each week, and a way of combining its output with other forecasts. The resulting forecasting system produced the most accurate forecasts in CDC’s 2015/2016 FluSight comparison of fourteen forecasting systems. We describe our new forecasting methods, analyze their performance in the 2015/2016 comparison and on data from previous seasons, and describe idiosyncrasies of epidemiological data that should be considered when constructing and evaluating forecasting systems.

"Regular treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) is the strategy for human schistosomiasis control aiming to prevent morbidity in later life. With the recent resolution on schistosomiasis elimination by the 65th World Health Assembly, appropriate diagnostic tools to inform interventions are keys to their success. We present a discrete Markov chains modelling framework that deals with the longitudinal study design and the measurement error in the diagnostic methods under study. A longitudinal detailed dataset from Uganda, in which one or two doses of PZQ treatment were provided, was analyzed through Latent Markov Models (LMMs). The aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Circulating Cathodic Antigen (CCA) and of double Kato-Katz (KK) faecal slides over three consecutive days for Schistosoma mansoni infection simultaneously by age group at baseline and at two follow-up times post treatment. Diagnostic test sensitivities and specificities and the true underlying infection prevalence over time as well as the probabilities of transitions between infected and uninfected states are provided. The estimated transition probability matrices provide parsimonious yet important insights into the re-infection and cure rates in the two age groups. We show that the CCA diagnostic performance remained constant after PZQ treatment and that this test was overall more sensitive but less specific than single-day double KK for the diagnosis of S. mansoni infection. The probability of clearing infection from baseline to 9 weeks was higher among those who received two PZQ doses compared to one PZQ dose for both age groups, with much higher re-infection rates among children compared to adolescents and adults. We recommend LMMs as a useful methodology for monitoring and evaluation and treatment decision research as well as CCA for mapping surveys of S. mansoni infection, although additional diagnostic tools should be incorporated in schistosomiasis elimination programs.
","Schistosomiasis remains one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in developing countries, with Schistosoma mansoni being the most widespread of the human-infecting schistosomes. For the routine surveillance of human S. mansoni infection more “field-applicable,” sensitive, and cost-effective diagnostics that replicate faecal samples over several consecutive days [the Kato-Katz (KK) method], are needed. We propose a statistical modelling framework in order to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the urine strip test for Circulating Cathodic Antigen (CCA) and single-day double KK measurements over three consecutive days for the diagnosis of S. mansoni infection in two different age groups from Uganda pre- and post- praziquantel (PZQ) treatment. We demonstrate that CCA is an appropriate tool for mapping surveys of S. mansoni infection. Our findings should allow for evaluation of the risk of potential misinterpretation with regards to diagnosis of S. mansoni infection through CCA or KK in this endemic setting pre- and post- PZQ treatment as the numbers and infection intensities are brought down, bridging existing important gaps in schistosomiasis diagnostics research. More generally, the proposed statistical analysis can reveal important biological insights from other diseases without gold standard diagnostic tools whenever longitudinal data are available.

"Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most important arthropod-borne pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases in humans. However, no vaccine or specific antiviral is available for dengue. As seen in other RNA viruses, the innate immune system plays a key role in controlling DENV infection and disease outcome. Although the interferon (IFN) response, which is central to host protective immunity, has been reported to limit DENV replication, the molecular details of how DENV infection is modulated by IFN treatment are elusive. In this study, by employing a gain-of-function screen using a type I IFN-treated cell-derived cDNA library, we identified a previously uncharacterized gene, C19orf66, as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) that inhibits DENV replication, which we named Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN). Overexpression and gene knockdown experiments revealed that expression of RyDEN confers resistance to all serotypes of DENV in human cells. RyDEN expression also limited the replication of hepatitis C virus, Kunjin virus, Chikungunya virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and human adenovirus. Importantly, RyDEN was considered to be a crucial effector molecule in the IFN-mediated anti-DENV response. When affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis was performed, RyDEN was revealed to form a complex with cellular mRNA-binding proteins, poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), and La motif-related protein 1 (LARP1). Interestingly, PABPC1 and LARP1 were found to be positive modulators of DENV replication. Since RyDEN influenced intracellular events on DENV replication and, suppression of protein synthesis from DENV-based reporter construct RNA was also observed in RyDEN-expressing cells, our data suggest that RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells.
","Dengue is the most common arthropod-borne viral infection and is spreading to new areas every year. Its causative agent, dengue virus (DENV), has immunologically distinct serotypes that increase the risk of life-threatening diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. However, an effective medication for dengue has not yet been established. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop new antivirals and vaccines against DENV. Here, we have characterized C19orf66, named Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN), as a cellular gene that inhibits the replication of all DENV serotypes. The expression of RyDEN was found to be upregulated by interferon (IFN) treatment and played a critical role in the IFN-mediated anti-DENV response. We also found that RyDEN was likely to block the protein translation of DENV RNA through its association with cellular mRNA-binding proteins and viral RNA. Intriguingly, replication of several other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, Kunjin virus, and Chikungunya virus, was also limited by RyDEN expression. Thus, this study describes a novel mechanism of an IFN-inducible inhibitory factor for DENV and provides the basis for future development of broad-spectrum antivirals against infectious viral diseases, including dengue.

"Extensive efforts have been made to understand genomic function through both experimental and computational approaches, yet proper annotation still remains challenging, especially in non-coding regions. In this manuscript, we introduce GenoSkyline, an unsupervised learning framework to predict tissue-specific functional regions through integrating high-throughput epigenetic annotations. GenoSkyline successfully identified a variety of non-coding regulatory machinery including enhancers, regulatory miRNA, and hypomethylated transposable elements in extensive case studies. Integrative analysis of GenoSkyline annotations and results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to novel biological insights on the etiologies of a number of human complex traits. We also explored using tissue-specific functional annotations to prioritize GWAS signals and predict relevant tissue types for each risk locus. Brain and blood-specific annotations led to better prioritization performance for schizophrenia than standard GWAS p-values and non-tissue-specific annotations. As for coronary artery disease, heart-specific functional regions was highly enriched of GWAS signals, but previously identified risk loci were found to be most functional in other tissues, suggesting a substantial proportion of still undetected heart-related loci. In summary, GenoSkyline annotations can guide genetic studies at multiple resolutions and provide valuable insights in understanding complex diseases. GenoSkyline is available at http://genocanyon.med.yale.edu/GenoSkyline.
","Genome-wide association study has been a productive approach to studying human complex diseases in the past decade, yet challenges still remain in both identifying and interpreting disease-associated loci. In our previous work, we showed that integrated analysis of GWAS summary statistics and genomic functional annotations could enhance the performance of signal prioritization. In this paper, we further improve our annotation through integrating a rich collection of epigenomic data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. We introduce GenoSkyline, a statistical framework to predict tissue-specific functional regions in the human genome, and demonstrate its ability to capture tissue-specific functionality through extensive case studies. We then illustrate a variety of ways that GenoSkyline could benefit post-GWAS analysis. The performance of signal prioritization is further improved using annotations of disease-related tissue types. Furthermore, combining GenoSkyline annotations with GWAS results allow us to partition heritability by tissue types and generate new hypotheses regarding the disease etiology behind each risk locus, thereby providing novel biological insights to many human complex diseases. GenoSkyline is powerful, robust, and customizable. We believe that GenoSkyline and its applications can guide genetics research at multiple resolutions and greatly benefit the broader scientific community.

"Patterned expression of many developmental genes is specified by transcription factor gene expression, but is thought to be refined by chromatin-mediated repression. Regulatory DNA sequences called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are required to repress some developmental target genes, and are widespread in genomes, suggesting that they broadly affect developmental programs. While PREs in transgenes can nucleate trimethylation on lysine 27 of the histone H3 tail (H3K27me3), none have been demonstrated to be necessary at endogenous chromatin domains. This failure is thought to be due to the fact that most endogenous H3K27me3 domains contain many PREs, and individual PREs may be redundant. In contrast to these ideas, we show here that PREs near the wing selector gene vestigial have distinctive roles at their endogenous locus, even though both PREs are repressors in transgenes. First, a PRE near the promoter is required for vestigial activation and not for repression. Second, only the distal PRE contributes to H3K27me3, but even removal of both PREs does not eliminate H3K27me3 across the vestigial domain. Thus, endogenous chromatin domains appear to be intrinsically marked by H3K27me3, and PREs appear required to enhance this chromatin modification to high levels at inactive genes.
","Eukaryotic genes are packaged in chromatin, and their transcription relies on activators that recruit RNA polymerases and on repressive factors. In multicellular organisms, cell types have distinct patterns of gene expression, and these patterns are controlled by by the expression of cell-type-specific transcription factors and by modulating chromatin structure. The Polycomb system is one major system for the chromatin-mediated silencing of developmental gene expression, where a histone methyltransferase marks extended chromatin domains with trimethylation of lysine-27 of the histone H3 tail (H3K27me3) and forms repressed chromatin. In Drosophila, repressive regulatory elements called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are thought to nucleate histone methyltransferase binding which then spreads across these domains. In this study, we demonstrate that two PREs near the developmental vestigial gene have distinct and separable effects on gene activation and chromatin structure. Both PREs are functional repressors in transgenes, but the PRE located near the vestigial promoter is required for gene transcription. This PRE has no effect on histone methylation of the domain. The second PRE located in the middle of the chromatin domain is required for high-level H3K27me3 of the domain, but this methylation is not required to refine vestigial gene expression. Significant chromatin methylation remains when both PREs are deleted. Our findings imply that PREs near promoters may play activating roles in gene expression in the Drosophila genome. We suggest that some domains of H3K27me3 may have little consequence for correctly patterning gene expression.

"Thailand is currently experiencing one of its worst dengue outbreaks in decades. As in most countries where this disease is endemic, dengue control in Thailand is largely reliant on the use of insecticides targeting both immature and adult stages of the Aedes mosquito, with the organophosphate insecticide, temephos, being the insecticide of choice for attacking the mosquito larvae. Resistance to temephos was first detected in Aedes aegypti larvae in Thailand approximately 25 years ago but the mechanism responsible for this resistance has not been determined.
Bioassays on Ae. aegypti larvae from Thailand detected temephos resistance ratios ranging from 3.5 fold in Chiang Mai to nearly 10 fold in Nakhon Sawan (NS) province. Synergist and biochemical assays suggested a role for increased carboxylesterase (CCE) activities in conferring temephos resistance in the NS population and microarray analysis revealed that the CCE gene, CCEae3a, was upregulated more than 60 fold in the NS population compared to the susceptible population. Upregulation of CCEae3a was shown to be partially due to gene duplication. Another CCE gene, CCEae6a, was also highly regulated in both comparisons. Sequencing and in silico structure prediction of CCEae3a showed that several amino acid polymorphisms in the NS population may also play a role in the increased resistance phenotype.
Carboxylesterases have previously been implicated in conferring temephos resistance in Ae aegypti but the specific member(s) of this family responsible for this phenotype have not been identified. The identification of a strong candidate is an important step in the development of new molecular diagnostic tools for management of temephos resistant populations and thus improved control of dengue.
","Temephos is the most important insecticide used in larviciding campaigns to reduce the risk of dengue transmission. This organophosphate insecticide has been in use for over 50 years and resistance to this chemical has been reported in Aedes aegypti populations from Latin America, the Caribbean and from Asia. In other insect species, organophosphate resistance is typically associated with mutations in the target site, acetylcholinesterase, that decrease the insect's sensitivity to the insecticide, or increases in the activity of one or more carboxylesterase enzymes, either by overproduction and/or amino acid substitutions, that reduce the amount of insecticide reaching the target site. Neither of these mechanisms has been previously characterised at the molecular level in dengue vectors. Here we identify an Ae aegypti carboxylesterase gene with expression levels and amino acid sequence polymorphisms correlating with temephos resistance in Thailand. This is a key step in the development of tools to manage resistance in this mosquito species.

"Liver disease is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality during HIV infection, despite the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The precise mechanisms of liver disease during HIV infection are poorly understood partially due to the difficulty in obtaining human liver samples as well as the presence of confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis co-infection, alcohol use). Utilizing the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model, a controlled study was conducted to evaluate the factors associated with liver inflammation and the impact of cART. We observed an increase in hepatic macrophages during untreated SIV infection that was associated with a number of inflammatory and fibrosis mediators (TNFα, CCL3, TGFβ). Moreover, an upregulation in the macrophage chemoattractant factor CCL2 was detected in the livers of SIV-infected macaques that coincided with an increase in the number of activated CD16+ monocyte/macrophages and T cells expressing the cognate receptor CCR2. Expression of Mac387 on monocyte/macrophages further indicated that these cells recently migrated to the liver. The hepatic macrophage and T cell levels strongly correlated with liver SIV DNA levels, and were not associated with the levels of 16S bacterial DNA. Utilizing in situ hybridization, SIV-infected cells were found primarily within portal triads, and were identified as T cells. Microarray analysis identified a strong antiviral transcriptomic signature in the liver during SIV infection. In contrast, macaques treated with cART exhibited lower levels of liver macrophages and had a substantial, but not complete, reduction in their inflammatory profile. In addition, residual SIV DNA and bacteria 16S DNA were detected in the livers during cART, implicating the liver as a site on-going immune activation during antiretroviral therapy. These findings provide mechanistic insights regarding how SIV infection promotes liver inflammation through macrophage recruitment, with implications for in HIV-infected individuals.
","Liver disease is common in HIV-infected individuals and is one of the leading causes of death in this population. Currently, the factors that contribute to liver disease during HIV infection are not known, as human studies are difficult to conduct. Therefore, pathogenic SIV infection of macaques is a valuable model system for understanding immune changes that occur in tissues during infection, including the liver. Using liver samples from uninfected and SIV-infected macaques, we observed an increase in liver macrophage infiltration that was likely mediated by the macrophage-attracting chemokine, CCL2. Importantly, liver macrophage number strongly correlated with liver SIV levels and the expression of liver inflammatory and fibrosis mediators during SIV infection. Further, we identified an upregulation of immune and inflammatory pathways in the liver of SIV-infected macaques, including a strong antiviral response. Treatment with antiretroviral drugs decreased macrophage infiltration and reduced liver inflammation, consistent with reduced SIV levels. In summary, these findings provide mechanistic insights into how SIV infection promotes liver inflammation through macrophage infiltration, which can predispose this population to liver complications during infection.

"Determining how proteins interact to form stable complexes is of crucial importance, for example in the development of novel therapeutics. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners, such as RosettaDock, might potentially emerge to become a promising alternative to traditional structure determination methods. However, while models virtually identical to the correct experimental structure can in some cases be generated, the main difficulty remains to discriminate correct or approximately correct models from decoys. This is due to the ruggedness of the free-energy landscape, the approximations intrinsic in the scoring functions, and the intrinsic flexibility of proteins. Here we show that molecular dynamics simulations performed starting from a number top-scoring models can not only discriminate decoys and identify the correct structure, but may also provide information on an initial map of the free energy landscape that elucidates the binding mechanism.
","Determining how proteins fold and form complexes is of crucial importance, for example in the development of novel therapeutics. Experimental determination of structures is costly and lengthy. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners are available and constantly improving. Such methods generate a large number of diverse conformations and rank them for their likelihood to be correct. Even a model very similar to the correct structure is rarely the top-scoring one, but, as in the examples presented here, only within the top ~10–100 (the exact number depends on the complexity of the structure, and could be much higher). Here we show through atomistic simulation that good models are kinetically stable and bad models most often are not. More surprisingly, we also see that some bad models spontaneously find the correct (i.e., experimentally determined) conformation. This is remarkable, and could become an additional tool to contribute to structure determination of protein complexes. Such a result can also be expected, because evolution sculpted the free energy landscape in a way that the biologically active state is not only the one of lowest free energy (i.e., the most likely state) but also robustly reachable and kinetically stable (i.e., at the bottom of a funnel on the free energy landscape).

"The complex connectivity of the cerebral cortex is a topic of much study, yet the link between structure and function is still unclear. The processing capacity and throughput of information at individual brain regions remains an open question and one that could potentially bridge these two aspects of neural organization. The rate at which information is emitted from different nodes in the network and how this output process changes under different external conditions are general questions that are not unique to neuroscience, but are of interest in multiple classes of telecommunication networks. In the present study we show how some of these questions may be addressed using tools from telecommunications research. An important system statistic for modeling and performance evaluation of distributed communication systems is the time between successive departures of units of information at each node in the network. We describe a method to extract and fully characterize the distribution of such inter-departure times from the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG). We show that inter-departure times are well fitted by the two-parameter Gamma distribution. Moreover, they are not spatially or neurophysiologically trivial and instead are regionally specific and sensitive to the presence of sensory input. In both the eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, inter-departure time distributions were more dispersed over posterior parietal channels, close to regions which are known to have the most dense structural connectivity. The biggest differences between the two conditions were observed at occipital sites, where inter-departure times were significantly more variable in the eyes-open condition. Together, these results suggest that message departure times are indicative of network traffic and capture a novel facet of neural activity.
","The brain may be thought of as a network of regions that communicate with each other to produce emergent phenomena such as perception and cognition. Many potentially interesting aspects of brain networks, such as how information is emitted at different nodes, also tend to be of interest in various types of telecommunication systems, such as telephony. Thus, network properties that are relevant in the context of brain function may be important for telecommunication networks in general. Here we show how neural activity can be partitioned into units of information and analyzed from the perspective of a telecommunication system. We demonstrate that the inter-departure times of such units of information have very similar probability distributions across subjects and that they are sensitive both to regional variation and cognitive state. The approach we describe can be applied in a wide variety of experimental paradigms to generate novel indices of neural activity and open new avenues for network analysis of the brain.

"Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) is a heritable multi-system disorder caused by abnormally short telomeres. Clinically diagnosed by the mucocutaneous symptoms, DC patients are at high risk for bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple types of cancers. We have recapitulated the most common DC-causing mutation in the shelterin component TIN2 by introducing a TIN2-R282H mutation into cultured telomerase-positive human cells via a knock-in approach. The resulting heterozygous TIN2-R282H mutation does not perturb occupancy of other shelterin components on telomeres, result in activation of telomeric DNA damage signaling or exhibit other characteristics indicative of a telomere deprotection defect. Using a novel assay that monitors the frequency and extension rate of telomerase activity at individual telomeres, we show instead that telomerase elongates telomeres at a reduced frequency in TIN2-R282H heterozygous cells; this recruitment defect is further corroborated by examining the effect of this mutation on telomerase-telomere co-localization. These observations suggest a direct role for TIN2 in mediating telomere length through telomerase, separable from its role in telomere protection.
","The shelterin complex protects telomeres from being processed by the DNA damage repair machinery, and also regulates telomerase access and activity at telomeres. The only shelterin subunit known to promote telomerase function is TPP1, which mediates telomerase recruitment to telomeres and stimulates telomerase processivity. Mutations in shelterin components cause Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) and related disease syndromes due to the inability to maintain telomere homeostasis. In this study, we have identified TIN2-R282H, the most common DC-causing mutation in shelterin subunit TIN2, as a separation-of-function mutant which impairs telomerase recruitment to telomeres, but not chromosome end protection. The telomerase recruitment defect conferred by TIN2-R282H is likely through a mechanism independent of TIN2’s role in anchoring TPP1 at telomeres, since TPP1 localization to telomeres is unaffected by the mutation.

"Human Long interspersed element-1 (L1) retrotransposons contain an internal RNA polymerase II promoter within their 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and encode two proteins, (ORF1p and ORF2p) required for their mobilization (i.e., retrotransposition). The evolutionary success of L1 relies on the continuous retrotransposition of full-length L1 mRNAs. Previous studies identified functional splice donor (SD), splice acceptor (SA), and polyadenylation sequences in L1 mRNA and provided evidence that a small number of spliced L1 mRNAs retrotransposed in the human genome. Here, we demonstrate that the retrotransposition of intra-5′UTR or 5′UTR/ORF1 spliced L1 mRNAs leads to the generation of spliced integrated retrotransposed elements (SpIREs). We identified a new intra-5′UTR SpIRE that is ten times more abundant than previously identified SpIREs. Functional analyses demonstrated that both intra-5′UTR and 5′UTR/ORF1 SpIREs lack Cis-acting transcription factor binding sites and exhibit reduced promoter activity. The 5′UTR/ORF1 SpIREs also produce nonfunctional ORF1p variants. Finally, we demonstrate that sequence changes within the L1 5′UTR over evolutionary time, which permitted L1 to evade the repressive effects of a host protein, can lead to the generation of new L1 splicing events, which, upon retrotransposition, generates a new SpIRE subfamily. We conclude that splicing inhibits L1 retrotransposition, SpIREs generally represent evolutionary “dead-ends” in the L1 retrotransposition process, mutations within the L1 5′UTR alter L1 splicing dynamics, and that retrotransposition of the resultant spliced transcripts can generate interindividual genomic variation.
","Long interspersed element-1 (L1) sequences comprise about 17% of the human genome reference sequence. The average human genome contains about 100 active L1s that mobilize throughout the genome by a “copy and paste” process termed retrotransposition. Active L1s encode two proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p). ORF1p and ORF2p preferentially bind to their encoding RNA, forming a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP). During retrotransposition, the L1 RNP translocates to the nucleus, where the ORF2p endonuclease makes a single-strand nick in target site DNA that exposes a 3′ hydroxyl group in genomic DNA. The 3′ hydroxyl group then is used as a primer by the ORF2p reverse transcriptase to copy the L1 RNA into cDNA, leading to the integration of an L1 copy at a new genomic location. The evolutionary success of L1 requires the faithful retrotransposition of full-length L1 mRNAs; thus, it was surprising to find that a small number of L1 retrotransposition events are derived from spliced L1 mRNAs. By using genetic, biochemical, and computational approaches, we demonstrate that spliced L1 mRNAs can undergo an initial round of retrotransposition, leading to the generation of spliced integrated retrotransposed elements (SpIREs). SpIREs represent about 2% of previously annotated full-length primate-specific L1s in the human genome reference sequence. However, because splicing leads to intra-L1 deletions that remove critical sequences required for L1 expression, SpIREs generally cannot undergo subsequent rounds of retrotransposition and can be considered “dead on arrival” insertions. Our data further highlight how genetic conflict between L1 and its host has influenced L1 expression, L1 retrotransposition, and L1 splicing dynamics over evolutionary time.

"Katanin is an evolutionarily conserved microtubule-severing complex implicated in multiple aspects of microtubule dynamics. Katanin consists of a p60 severing enzyme and a p80 regulatory subunit. The p80 subunit is thought to regulate complex targeting and severing activity, but its precise role remains elusive. In lower-order species, the katanin complex has been shown to modulate mitotic and female meiotic spindle dynamics and flagella development. The in vivo function of katanin p80 in mammals is unknown. Here we show that katanin p80 is essential for male fertility. Specifically, through an analysis of a mouse loss-of-function allele (the Taily line), we demonstrate that katanin p80, most likely in association with p60, has an essential role in male meiotic spindle assembly and dissolution and the removal of midbody microtubules and, thus, cytokinesis. Katanin p80 also controls the formation, function, and dissolution of a microtubule structure intimately involved in defining sperm head shaping and sperm tail formation, the manchette, and plays a role in the formation of axoneme microtubules. Perturbed katanin p80 function, as evidenced in the Taily mouse, results in male sterility characterized by decreased sperm production, sperm with abnormal head shape, and a virtual absence of progressive motility. Collectively these data demonstrate that katanin p80 serves an essential and evolutionarily conserved role in several aspects of male germ cell development.
","Microtubules are critical components of cells, acting as a “scaffold” for the movement of organelles and proteins within the cytoplasm. The control of microtubule length, number, and movement is essential for many cellular processes, including division, architecture, and migration. We have defined the role of the microtubule severing protein katanin p80 in male germ cell development. Male mice carrying a point mutation in the p80 gene are sterile as a consequence of low numbers of sperm, abnormal sperm morphology, and poor motility (ability to “swim”). We show that this mutation is associated with defects in microtubule structures involved in the division of immature sperm cells, in structures that shape the sperm head, and in the sperm tail, which is essential for sperm movement in the female reproductive tract. This study is the first to show that katanin p80, via its effects on microtubule dynamics within the testis, is required for male fertility.

"The free-living aquatic bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, exhibits two different morphologies during its life cycle. The morphological change from swarmer cell to stalked cell is a result of changes of function of two bi-functional histidine kinases, PleC and CckA. Here, we describe a detailed molecular mechanism by which the function of PleC changes between phosphatase and kinase state. By mathematical modeling of our proposed molecular interactions, we derive conditions under which PleC, CckA and its response regulators exhibit bistable behavior, thus providing a scenario for robust switching between swarmer and stalked states. Our simulations are in reasonable agreement with in vitro and in vivo experimental observations of wild type and mutant phenotypes. According to our model, the kinase form of PleC is essential for the swarmer-to-stalked transition and to prevent premature development of the swarmer pole. Based on our results, we reconcile some published experimental observations and suggest novel mutants to test our predictions.
","Recent evidence suggests that the transition of PleC from phosphatase to kinase is induced by its own substrate, DivK. Based on experimental clues, we propose a molecular mechanism to explain this substrate-induced conformational change in PleC. The general principles of thermodynamics, enzyme-substrate reactions and the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery motivate the elementary chemical reactions proposed in our model. Formulating our hypothesis in terms of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, we show that the PleC transition could function as a bistable switch. Although initial experimental studies have suggested that the primary role of PleC is as a phosphatase, our simulations show that the PleC kinase form is relevant for the correct temporal regulation of the Caulobacter cell cycle.

"The Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 nuclease complex, together with Sae2, initiates the 5′-to-3′ resection of Double-Strand DNA Breaks (DSBs). Extended 3′ single stranded DNA filaments can be exposed from a DSB through the redundant activities of the Exo1 nuclease and the Dna2 nuclease with the Sgs1 helicase. In the absence of Sae2, Mre11 binding to a DSB is prolonged, the two DNA ends cannot be kept tethered, and the DSB is not efficiently repaired. Here we show that deletion of the yeast 53BP1-ortholog RAD9 reduces Mre11 binding to a DSB, leading to Rad52 recruitment and efficient DSB end-tethering, through an Sgs1-dependent mechanism. As a consequence, deletion of RAD9 restores DSB repair either in absence of Sae2 or in presence of a nuclease defective MRX complex. We propose that, in cells lacking Sae2, Rad9/53BP1 contributes to keep Mre11 bound to a persistent DSB, protecting it from extensive DNA end resection, which may lead to potentially deleterious DNA deletions and genome rearrangements.
","DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most deleterious types of damage occurring in the genome, as failure to repair these lesions through either non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) leads to genetic instability. The 5′ strand of a DSB can be nucleolytically degraded by several nucleases and associated factors, including Mre11, CtIP/Sae2, Exo1 and Dna2 together with Bloom helicase/Sgs1, through a finely regulated process called DSB resection. Once resection is initiated, error-prone NHEJ is prevented. Several findings suggest that DSB resection is a double-edged sword, if not finely regulated, since on one hand it is needed for faithful HR, but on the other it may lead to extensive DNA deletions associated with genome instability. Both in mammals and yeast, 53BP1/Rad9 protein binds near the lesion and counteracts the resection process, limiting the formation of ssDNA. By using S. cerevisiae as a model organism, here we show that Rad9 oligomers block the removal of hypo-active Mre11 protein from a persistent DSB, thus limiting initiation of resection and the recruitment of the recombination factor Rad52, in the absence of Sae2. Altogether, these findings pinpoint a critical role of 53BP1/Rad9 in balancing HR and NHEJ repair events throughout the cell cycle.

"Many genes are recruited to the nuclear periphery upon transcriptional activation. The mechanism and functional significance of this recruitment is unclear. We find that recruitment of the yeast INO1 and GAL1 genes to the nuclear periphery is rapid and independent of transcription. Surprisingly, these genes remain at the periphery for generations after they are repressed. Localization at the nuclear periphery serves as a form of memory of recent transcriptional activation, promoting reactivation. Previously expressed GAL1 at the nuclear periphery is activated much more rapidly than long-term repressed GAL1 in the nucleoplasm, even after six generations of repression. Localization of INO1 at the nuclear periphery is necessary and sufficient to promote more rapid activation. This form of transcriptional memory is chromatin based; the histone variant H2A.Z is incorporated into nucleosomes within the recently repressed INO1 promoter and is specifically required for rapid reactivation of both INO1 and GAL1. Furthermore, H2A.Z is required to retain INO1 at the nuclear periphery after repression. Therefore, H2A.Z-mediated localization of recently repressed genes at the nuclear periphery represents an epigenetic state that confers memory of transcriptional activation and promotes reactivation.
","Eukaryotic cells control the spatial arrangement of chromosomes; the localization of genes can both reflect and contribute to their transcriptional state. A number of genes in the simple eukaryote brewer's yeast are “recruited” to the nuclear periphery through interactions with the nuclear pore complex when they are expressed. The functional significance of peripheral recruitment is unclear.
Here, we show that recruited genes are actively retained at the periphery for generations after transcription is repressed. This suggests that localization at the nuclear periphery represents a novel inherited state that might allow simple eukaryotic organisms to “remember” previous transcriptional activation. This type of memory allows for more robust reactivation of genes, suggesting that it is adaptive. Finally, both retention at the nuclear periphery and rapid reactivation require a variant form of histone H2A.
Adaptive memory is distinct from other types of transcriptional memory. In developmental memory, transcriptional states established by transcriptional regulators early in embryogenesis are propagated long after these regulators have disappeared. Adaptive memory does not propagate a state, but represents a novel state that serves as a source of information. In this way, it resembles a rudimentary form of cellular learning that allows cells to benefit from recent experience.

"There are limited data describing the functional characteristics of HIV-1 specific antibodies in breast milk (BM) and their role in breastfeeding transmission. The ability of BM antibodies to bind HIV-1 envelope, neutralize heterologous and autologous viruses and direct antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) were analyzed in BM and plasma obtained soon after delivery from 10 non-transmitting and 9 transmitting women with high systemic viral loads and plasma neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Because subtype A is the dominant subtype in this cohort, a subtype A envelope variant that was sensitive to plasma NAbs was used to assess the different antibody activities. We found that NAbs against the subtype A heterologous virus and/or the woman's autologous viruses were rare in IgG and IgA purified from breast milk supernatant (BMS) – only 4 of 19 women had any detectable NAb activity against either virus. Detected NAbs were of low potency (median IC50 value of 10 versus 647 for the corresponding plasma) and were not associated with infant infection (p = 0.58). The low NAb activity in BMS versus plasma was reflected in binding antibody levels: HIV-1 envelope specific IgG titers were 2.2 log10 lower (compared to 0.59 log10 lower for IgA) in BMS versus plasma. In contrast, antibodies capable of ADCC were common and could be detected in the BMS from all 19 women. BMS envelope-specific IgG titers were associated with both detection of IgG NAbs (p = 0.0001)and BMS ADCC activity (p = 0.014). Importantly, BMS ADCC capacity was inversely associated with infant infection risk (p = 0.039). Our findings indicate that BMS has low levels of envelope specific IgG and IgA with limited neutralizing activity. However, this small study of women with high plasma viral loads suggests that breastmilk ADCC activity is a correlate of transmission that may impact infant infection risk.
","In the absence of intervention, only about one third of infants born to HIV-1 infected mothers who are continuously exposed to maternal breast milk over prolonged periods get infected. This observation raises the possibility that immune factors in infected women play a role in limiting HIV-1 transmission. Identifying factors associated with reduced HIV-1 transmission risk will improve our understanding on the potential correlates of protection that should be the focus of generating effective immunogens and vaccination protocols. Here we assessed the functional role of breast milk antibodies in a group of women with high plasma viral loads and systemic NAbs and determined that overall, breast milk contains low levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to plasma. In contrast, we observed a robust non-neutralizing activity in breast milk that was associated with infant infection status. Our study adds to the growing evidence of a potential role of non-neutralizing antibodies in limiting HIV-1 transmission and calls for more attention to this arm of the HIV-1 response.

"Mass azithromycin distributions have been shown to reduce mortality among pre-school children in sub-Saharan Africa. It is unclear what mediates this mortality reduction, but one possibility is that antibiotics function as growth promoters for young children.
24 rural Ethiopian communities that had received biannual mass azithromycin distributions over the previous four years were enrolled in a parallel-group, cluster-randomized trial. Communities were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either continuation of biannual oral azithromycin (20mg/kg for children, 1 g for adults) or to no programmatic antibiotics over the 36 months of the study period. All community members 6 months and older were eligible for the intervention. The primary outcome was ocular chlamydia; height and weight were measured as secondary outcomes on children less than 60 months of age at months 12 and 36. Study participants were not masked; anthropometrists were not informed of the treatment allocation. Anthropometric measurements were collected for 282 children aged 0–36 months at the month 12 assessment and 455 children aged 0–59 months at the month 36 assessment, including 207 children who had measurements at both time points. After adjusting for age and sex, children were slightly but not significantly taller in the biannually treated communities (84.0 cm, 95%CI 83.2–84.8, in the azithromycin-treated communities vs. 83.7 cm, 95%CI 82.9–84.5, in the untreated communities; mean difference 0.31 cm, 95%CI -0.85 to 1.47, P = 0.60). No adverse events were reported.
Periodic mass azithromycin distributions for trachoma did not demonstrate a strong impact on childhood growth.
The TANA II trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov #NCT01202331.
","Mass distribution of a single dose of the broad-spectrum antibiotic azithromycin twice per year to pre-school children in Sub-Saharan Africa has been shown to reduce childhood mortality. The mechanism by which azithromycin reduces mortality is currently not clear, especially since the antibiotic is not targeted to sick children but rather given to all children in the community whether or not they have an infectious disease. In this study, we report the height and weight of children enrolled in a trial in Ethiopia in which communities were randomized either to twice annual mass azithromycin distributions for blinding trachoma or to no treatments. After accounting for age and sex, children from azithromycin-treated communities were on average slightly taller at the 12- and 36-month study visits than those from untreated communities, but the difference was not statistically significant.

"TGFβs act through canonical and non-canonical pathways, and canonical signals are transduced via Smad2 and Smad3. However, the contribution of canonical vs. non-canonical pathways in cartilage is unknown because the role of Smad2 in chondrogenesis has not been investigated in vivo. Therefore, we analyzed mice in which Smad2 is deleted in cartilage (Smad2CKO), global Smad3-/- mutants, and crosses of these strains. Growth plates at birth from all mutant strains exhibited expanded columnar and hypertrophic zones, linked to increased proliferation in resting chondrocytes. Defects were more severe in Smad2CKO and Smad2CKO;Smad3-/- (Smad2/3) mutant mice than in Smad3-/- mice, demonstrating that Smad2 plays a role in chondrogenesis. Increased levels of Ihh RNA, a key regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, were seen in prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the three mutant strains at birth. In accordance, TGFβ treatment decreased Ihh RNA levels in primary chondrocytes from control (Smad2fx/fx) mice, but inhibition was impaired in cells from mutants. Consistent with the skeletal phenotype, the impact on TGFβ-mediated inhibition of Ihh RNA expression was more severe in Smad2CKO than in Smad3-/- cells. Putative Smad2/3 binding elements (SBEs) were identified in the proximal Ihh promoter. Mutagenesis demonstrated a role for three of them. ChIP analysis suggested that Smad2 and Smad3 have different affinities for these SBEs, and that the repressors SnoN and Ski were differentially recruited by Smad2 and Smad3, respectively. Furthermore, nuclear localization of the repressor Hdac4 was decreased in growth plates of Smad2CKO and double mutant mice. TGFβ induced association of Hdac4 with Smad2, but not with Smad3, on the Ihh promoter. Overall, these studies revealed that Smad2 plays an essential role in the development of the growth plate, that both Smads 2 and 3 inhibit Ihh expression in the neonatal growth plate, and suggested they accomplish this by binding to distinct SBEs, mediating assembly of distinct repressive complexes.
","The cartilage growth plate regulates the size and shape of nearly every skeletal element in the body. TGFβs are potent inducers of cartilage formation, but the mechanisms by which they transduce their signals in cartilage during development are poorly understood. Similarly, there is strong evidence that dysregulation of the TGFβ pathway increases the risk for osteoarthritis (OA) in humans, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. TGFβs transduce their signals through a canonical pathway involving Smad2 and Smad3, and through several non-canonical pathways. However, the roles of canonical vs. noncanonical signaling are unknown in cartilage because the combined roles of Smad2 and Smad3 have not been determined. We generated mice lacking both Smad2 and Smad3 in cartilage in order to determine the role of canonical TGFβ signaling during embryonic development. We determined that Smad2 has a more prominent role than Smad3 in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, and identified elevated levels of Ihh RNA in neonatal cartilage in Smad2 and Smad3 mutants. These findings may be important because Ihh is a vital regulator of cartilage proliferation and differentiation during cartilage development. More generally, the studies identify how Smad2 and Smad3 can regulate a common target gene through distinct mechanisms.

"Hox mediated neuroblast apoptosis is a prevalent way to pattern larval central nervous system (CNS) by different Hox genes, but the mechanism of this apoptosis is not understood. Our studies with Abdominal-A (Abd-A) mediated larval neuroblast (pNB) apoptosis suggests that AbdA, its cofactor Extradenticle (Exd), a helix-loop-helix transcription factor Grainyhead (Grh), and Notch signaling transcriptionally contribute to expression of RHG family of apoptotic genes. We find that Grh, AbdA, and Exd function together at multiple motifs on the apoptotic enhancer. In vivo mutagenesis of these motifs suggest that they are important for the maintenance of the activity of the enhancer rather than its initiation. We also find that Exd function is independent of its known partner homothorax in this apoptosis. We extend some of our findings to Deformed expressing region of sub-esophageal ganglia where pNBs undergo a similar Hox dependent apoptosis. We propose a mechanism where common players like Exd-Grh-Notch work with different Hox genes through region specific enhancers to pattern respective segments of larval central nervous system.
","Specification of the head to tail axis of the developing central nervous system is carried out by Hox genes. Hox mediated programmed cell death of the neural progenitor cells plays an important role in specification of this axis, but the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood. We have studied this phenomenon in abdominal and subesophageal regions of larval central nervous system of Drosophila. We find that different Hox genes use a combination of common players (Extradenticle, Grainyhead and Notch) but employ region specific enhancers to cause progenitor cell death in different segments of developing central nervous system.

"Nodular Oesophagostomum genus nematodes are a major public health concern in some African regions because they can be lethal to humans. Their relatively high prevalence in people has been described in Uganda recently. While non-human primates also harbor Oesophagostomum spp., the epidemiology of this oesophagostomosis and the role of these animals as reservoirs of the infection in Eastern Africa are not yet well documented.
The present study aimed to investigate Oesophagostomum infection in terms of parasite species diversity, prevalence and load in three non-human primates (Pan troglodytes, Papio anubis, Colobus guereza) and humans living in close proximity in a forested area of Sebitoli, Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda. The molecular phylogenetic analyses provided the first evidence that humans living in the Sebitoli area harbored O. stephanostomum, a common species in free-ranging chimpanzees. Chimpanzees were also infected by O. bifurcum, a common species described in human populations throughout Africa. The recently described Oesophagostomum sp. found in colobine monkeys and humans and which was absent from baboons in the neighboring site of Kanyawara in KNP (10 km from Sebitoli), was only found in baboons. Microscopic analyses revealed that the infection prevalence and parasite load in chimpanzees were significantly lower in Kanyawara than in Sebitoli, an area more impacted by human activities at its borders.
Three different Oesophagostomum species circulate in humans and non-human primates in the Sebitoli area and our results confirm the presence of a new genotype of Oesophagostomum recently described in Uganda. The high spatiotemporal overlap between humans and chimpanzees in the studied area coupled with the high infection prevalence among chimpanzees represent factors that could increase the risk of transmission for O. stephanostomum between the two primate species. Finally, the importance of local-scale research for zoonosis risk management is important because environmental disturbance and species contact can differ, leading to different parasitological profiles between sites that are close together within the same forest patches.
","Nodular worms frequently infect primates, pigs and ruminants. These intestinal nematodes induce inflammatory masses in the colon wall that cause severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and potential death. Through microscopic and molecular analyses, we studied the presence of nodular worms in three non-human primates (chimpanzees, baboons, black and white colobus) and humans inhabiting the Sebitoli area, at the extreme north of Kibale National Park in Uganda. Three different Oesophagostomum species were identified in the primates studied and we confirmed the existence of a recently described clade in baboons. Because the Sebitoli chimpanzees displayed a high prevalence of infection and because a high spatiotemporal overlap between humans and apes occurred in our study area, the risk of transmission of O. stephanostomum between the two species cannot be neglected. Thus, our results add to our understanding of nodular worm infection in location where non human primates and humans are co-existing, and underline the necessity to conduct further research at a local scale in a public health concern.

"The three-dimensional positions of immune cells can be tracked in live tissues precisely as a function of time using two-photon microscopy. However, standard methods of analysis used in the field and experimental artifacts can bias interpretations and obscure important aspects of cell migration such as directional migration and non-Brownian walk statistics. Therefore, methods were developed for minimizing drift artifacts, identifying directional and anisotropic (asymmetric) migration, and classifying cell migration statistics. These methods were applied to describe the migration statistics of CD8+ T cells in uninflamed lymph nodes. Contrary to current models, CD8+ T cell statistics are not well described by a straightforward persistent random walk model. Instead, a model in which one population of cells moves via Brownian-like motion and another population follows variable persistent random walks with noise reproduces multiple statistical measures of CD8+ T cell migration in the lymph node in the absence of inflammation.
","Migration is fundamental to immune cell function, and accurate quantitative methods are crucial for analyzing and interpreting migration statistics. However, existing methods of analysis cannot uniquely describe cell behavior and suffer from various limitations. This complicates efforts to address questions such as to what extent chemotactic signals direct cellular behaviors and how random migration of many cells leads to coordinated immune response. We therefore develop methods that provide a complete description of migration with a minimum of assumptions and describe specific quantities for characterizing directional motion. Using numerical simulations and experimental data, we evaluate these measures and discuss methods to minimize the effects of experimental artifacts. These methodologies may be applied to various migrating cells or organisms. We apply our approach to an important model system, T cells migrating in lymph node. Surprisingly, we find that the canonical Brownian-walker-like model does not accurately describe migration. Instead, we find that T cells move heterogeneously and are described by a two-population model of persistent and diffusive random walkers. This model is completely different from the generalized Lévy walk model that describes activated T cells in brains infected with Toxoplasma gondii, indicating that T cells exhibit distinct migration statistics in different tissues.

"Under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) from 2000–2006. The World Health Organization recommends systematic post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent LF transmission. We compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-MDA surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6–7 years, and a community-based survey targeting people aged ≥8 years.
In 2016, we conducted a systematic school-based TAS in all elementary schools (N = 29) and a cluster survey in 28 villages on the two main islands of American Samoa. We collected information on demographics and risk factors for infection using electronic questionnaires, and recorded geo-locations of schools and households. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip. For those who tested positive, we prepared slides for microscopic examination of microfilaria and provided treatment. Descriptive statistics were performed for questionnaire variables. Data were weighted and adjusted to account for sampling design and sex for both surveys, and for age in the community survey.
The school-based TAS (n = 1143) identified nine antigen-positive children and found an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3–1.8). Of the nine positive children, we identified one microfilariaemic 7-year-old child. The community-based survey (n = 2507, 711 households) identified 102 antigen-positive people, and estimated an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2% (95% CI: 4.5–8.6). Adjusted village-level prevalence ranged from 0–47.1%. CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. Of 86 antigen-positive community members from whom slides were prepared, 22 (25.6%) were microfilaraemic. School-based TAS had limited sensitivity (range 0–23.8%) and negative predictive value (range 25–83.3%) but had high specificity (range 83.3–100%) and positive predictive value (range 0–100%) for identifying villages with ongoing transmission.
American Samoa failed the school-based TAS in 2016, and the community-based survey identified higher than expected numbers of antigen-positive people. School-based TAS was logistically simpler and enabled sampling of a larger proportion of the target population, but the results did not provide a good indication of the overall CFA prevalence in older age groups and was not sensitive at identifying foci of ongoing transmission. The community-based survey, although operationally more challenging, identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages, and foci of high antigen prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission.
","Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by infection with filarial worms that are transmitted by mosquito bites. Globally, 68 million are infected, with ~36 million people disfigured and disabled by complications such as severe swelling of the legs (elephantiasis) or scrotum (hydrocele). The Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF) aims to interrupt disease transmission through mass drug administration (MDA), and to control illness and suffering in affected persons by 2020. The World Health Organization recommends conducting Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) in school children aged 6–7 years, to determine if infection rates have dropped to levels where disease transmission is no longer sustainable. American Samoa made significant progress towards eliminating LF. Following seven rounds of MDA, American Samoa passed TAS in 2011–2012 and 2015, with antigen prevalence of <1%. Despite passing TAS, recent studies have provided evidence of ongoing disease transmission in American Samoa, questioning the suitability of TAS for conducting surveillance after MDA has stopped. We compared a school-based survey of children aged 6–7 years and a community-based survey targeting people aged ≥8 years as tools for conducting post-MDA surveillance of LF. Our study provides recommendations for strengthening of post-MDA surveillance as countries approach the GPELF elimination targets.

"Gut immunity is regulated by intricate and dynamic mechanisms to ensure homeostasis despite a constantly changing microbial environment. Several regulatory factors have been described to participate in feedback responses to prevent aberrant immune activity. Little is, however, known about how transcriptional programs are directly tuned to efficiently adapt host gut tissues to the current microbiome. Here we show that the POU/Oct gene nubbin (nub) encodes two transcription factor isoforms, Nub-PB and Nub-PD, which antagonistically regulate immune gene expression in Drosophila. Global transcriptional profiling of adult flies overexpressing Nub-PB in immunocompetent tissues revealed that this form is a strong transcriptional activator of a large set of immune genes. Further genetic analyses showed that Nub-PB is sufficient to drive expression both independently and in conjunction with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), JNK and JAK/STAT pathways. Similar overexpression of Nub-PD did, conversely, repress expression of the same targets. Strikingly, isoform co-overexpression normalized immune gene transcription, suggesting antagonistic activities. RNAi-mediated knockdown of individual nub transcripts in enterocytes confirmed antagonistic regulation by the two isoforms and that both are necessary for normal immune gene transcription in the midgut. Furthermore, enterocyte-specific Nub-PB expression levels had a strong impact on gut bacterial load as well as host lifespan. Overexpression of Nub-PB enhanced bacterial clearance of ingested Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15. Nevertheless, flies quickly succumbed to the infection, suggesting a deleterious immune response. In line with this, prolonged overexpression promoted a proinflammatory signature in the gut with induction of JNK and JAK/STAT pathways, increased apoptosis and stem cell proliferation. These findings highlight a novel regulatory mechanism of host-microbe interactions mediated by antagonistic transcription factor isoforms.
","The numerous human diseases caused by aberrations in intestinal immunity and integrity urge a better understanding of the regulatory interactions that balance the output of host-microbe interactions. In this study, we discovered a novel phenomenon of transcriptional antagonism exerted via two isoforms encoded from the same gene. Balanced expression of the two forms was necessary for ensuring normal immune gene expression and maintaining immunological homeostasis in the Drosophila gut. We performed genetic manipulations to skew the balance of these isoforms. This resulted in a dysregulated immune system, changed levels of gut bacteria and altered host lifespan. Moreover, when we overexpressed the activating form flies quickly succumbed to oral bacterial infection despite an enhanced immune response. We suggest that antagonistically acting transcription factor isoforms may constitute a general mechanism for adjusting gene expression in various biological processes.

"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen causing severe infections often characterized by robust neutrophilic infiltration. Neutrophils provide the first line of defense against P. aeruginosa. Aside from their defense conferred by phagocytic activity, neutrophils also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to immobilize bacteria. Although NET formation is an important antimicrobial process, the details of its mechanism are largely unknown. The identity of the main components of P. aeruginosa responsible for triggering NET formation is unclear. In this study, our focus was to identify the main bacterial factors mediating NET formation and to gain insight into the underlying mechanism. We found that P. aeruginosa in its exponential growth phase promoted strong NET formation in human neutrophils while its NET-inducing ability dramatically decreased at later stages of bacterial growth. We identified the flagellum as the primary component of P. aeruginosa responsible for inducing NET extrusion as flagellum-deficient bacteria remained seriously impaired in triggering NET formation. Purified P. aeruginosa flagellin, the monomeric component of the flagellum, does not stimulate NET formation in human neutrophils. P. aeruginosa-induced NET formation is independent of the flagellum-sensing receptors TLR5 and NLRC4 in both human and mouse neutrophils. Interestingly, we found that flagellar motility, not flagellum binding to neutrophils per se, mediates NET release induced by flagellated bacteria. Immotile, flagellar motor-deficient bacterial strains producing paralyzed flagella did not induce NET formation. Forced contact between immotile P. aeruginosa and neutrophils restored their NET-inducing ability. Both the motAB and motCD genetic loci encoding flagellar motor genes contribute to maximal NET release; however the motCD genes play a more important role. Phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa and superoxide production by neutrophils were also largely dependent upon a functional flagellum. Taken together, the flagellum is herein presented for the first time as the main organelle of planktonic bacteria responsible for mediating NET release. Furthermore, flagellar motility, rather than binding of the flagellum to flagellum-sensing receptors on host cells, is required for P. aeruginosa to induce NET release.
","Pseudomonas aeruginosa leaves a large footprint in human disease because it causes infections in immunocompromised patients. Its ability to quickly adapt to diverse environments and to form biofilms poses a significant challenge to the medical community. Neutrophil granulocytes, professional phagocytes found cruising through the body’s circulatory system and tissues, provide the most efficient immune response against P. aeruginosa. Neutrophils utilize multiple strategies to eliminate bacteria. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a DNA-based scaffold with attached antimicrobial proteins, provides an efficient mechanism to trap P. aeruginosa. The detailed mechanism of NET release induced by bacteria remains unclear. Our data show that the flagellum, the organelle that provides swimming motility to P. aeruginosa, is the main factor required to induce NET release. Our novel findings indicate that the flagellum, and in particular swimming motility, mediates P. aeruginosa-induced NET extrusion independently of the well-characterized flagellin receptors. The novel data presented here also suggest that down-regulation of flagellar motility characteristically seen in P. aeruginosa lung infections in cystic fibrosis is relevant for P. aeruginosa to avoid neutrophil attacks.

"The strict human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae can utilize homologous recombination to generate antigenic variability in targets of immune surveillance. To evade the host immune response, N. gonorrhoeae promotes high frequency gene conversion events between many silent pilin copies and the expressed pilin locus (pilE), resulting in the production of variant pilin proteins. Previously, we identified a guanine quartet (G4) structure localized near pilE that is required for the homologous recombination reactions leading to pilin antigenic variation (Av). In this work, we demonstrate that inactivating the promoter of a small non-coding RNA (sRNA) that initiates within the G4 forming sequence blocks pilin Av. The sRNA promoter is conserved in all sequenced gonococcal strains, and mutations in the predicted transcript downstream of the G4 forming sequence do not alter pilin Av. A mutation that produces a stronger promoter or substitution of the pilE G4-associated sRNA promoter with a phage promoter (when the phage polymerase was expressed) produced wild-type levels of pilin Av. Altering the direction and orientation of the pilE G4-associated sRNA disrupted pilin Av. In addition, expression of the sRNA at a distal site on the gonococcal chromosome in the context of a promoter mutant did not support pilin Av. We conclude that the DNA containing the G-rich sequence can only form the G4 structure during transcription of this sRNA, thus providing a unique molecular step for the initiation of programmed recombination events.
","To evade the host immune response, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to provide genetic diversity in targets of immune surveillance. Organisms that express these diversification systems are under strong evolutionary pressure to provide subpopulations of preexisting variants and often rely on cellular recombination machinery to catalyze dedicated high-frequency reactions without disturbing genome integrity. Previously, we defined a guanine quartet (G4) structure in the strict human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae that is required for initiating the homologous recombination reactions leading to pilin antigenic variation (Av). G4 structures have been implicated in many biological processes, however the mechanisms allowing their formation within a chromosome have not been elucidated. In this work, we show a direct link between transcription of a small RNA (sRNA) that initiates within the G4 structure forming sequence and pilin Av and conclude that the process of transcription is necessary for G4 structure formation. sRNAs have emerged as important regulatory molecules in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and this is a novel activity of a sRNA in a bacterium. We anticipate that the reliance of G4 structure formation on transcription is a mechanism used by other biological systems that rely on this alternative DNA structure.

"In the present paper, we quantify, with a rigorous approach, the nature of motor activity in response to Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), in the mouse. DBS is currently being used in the treatment of a broad range of diseases, but its underlying principles are still unclear. Because mouse movement involves rapidly repeated starting and stopping, one must statistically verify that the movement at a given stimulation time was not just coincidental, endogenously-driven movement. Moreover, the amount of activity changes significantly over the circadian rhythm, and hence the means, variances and autocorrelations are all time varying. A new methodology is presented. For example, to discern what is and what is not impacted by stimulation, velocity is classified (in a time-evolving manner) as being zero-, one- and two-dimensional movement. The most important conclusions of the paper are: (1) (DBS) stimulation is proven to be truly effective; (2) it is two-dimensional (2-D) movement that strongly differs between light and dark and responds to stimulation; and, (3) stimulation in the light initiates a manner of movement, 2-D movement, that is more commonly seen in the (non-stimulated) dark. Based upon these conclusions, it is conjectured that the above patterns of 2-D movement could be a straightforward, easy to calculate correlate of arousal. The above conclusions will aid in the systematic evaluation and understanding of how DBS in CNS arousal pathways leads to the activation of behavior.
","Brainstem and thalamic regulation of arousal has been studied experimentally since the mid 20-th century. Today, Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is used in the treatment of movement disorders, chronic pain, clinical depression, amongst others. At present, the proper choice of DBS parameters (frequency and strength of the electric stimulation), and how those parameters should be modified as conditions change, are not well understood. In this work, using motor activity as the observed response, a statistical framework is developed for such study, and a quantitative relationship between parameter values and response is established. Within this framework, a possible correlate of arousal, the rapid onset of spatial (two-dimensional) movement, is uncovered and also studied. One long-term hope for techniques such as DBS are that they could assist in the treatment of disorders of consciousness, by supplementing or replacing (e.g., in Traumatic Brain Injury) what should ordinarily be the appropriate endogenous stimulation.

"The Clostridium difficile exotoxin, TcdB, which is a major virulence factor, varies between strains of this pathogen. Herein, we show that TcdB from the epidemic BI/NAP1/027 strain of C. difficile is more lethal, causes more extensive brain hemorrhage, and is antigenically variable from TcdB produced by previously studied strains of this pathogen (TcdB003). In mouse intoxication assays, TcdB from a ribotype 027 strain (TcdB027) was at least four fold more lethal than TcdB003. TcdB027 caused a previously undescribed brain hemorrhage in mice and this correlated with a heightened sensitivity of brain microvascular endothelial cells to the toxin. TcdB003 and TcdB027 also differed in their antigenic profiles and did not share cross-neutralizing epitopes in a major immunogenic region of the protein. Solid phase humoral mapping of epitopes in the carboxy-terminal domains (CTD) of TcdB027 and TcdB003 identified 11 reactive epitopes that varied between the two forms of TcdB, and 13 epitopes that were shared or overlapping. Despite the epitope differences and absence of neutralizing epitopes in the CTD of TcdB027, a toxoid form of this toxin primed a strong protective response. These findings indicate TcdB027 is a more potent toxin than TcdB003 as measured by lethality assays and pathology, moreover the sequence differences between the two forms of TcdB alter antigenic epitopes and reduce cross-neutralization by antibodies targeting the CTD.
","During the past decade, the C. difficile BI/NAP1/027 strain has emerged and in some settings predominated as the cause of C. difficile infection. Moreover, in some reports C. difficile BI/NAP1/027 has been associated with more severe disease. The reasons for association of this strain with more severe disease and relapse are poorly understood. We compared the toxicity and antigenic profiles of the major C. difficile virulence factor, TcdB, from a previously studied reference strain and a BI/NAP1/027 strain. The results indicate TcdB027, the toxin from the BI/NAP1/027 strain, is more lethal and causes more extensive brain hemorrhaging than TcdB003, the toxin produced by a reference strain of C. difficile. Furthermore, the results show that the antigenic carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) encodes at least 11 epitopes that differ between the two forms of TcdB. In line with this, experiments demonstrate that antiserum against the CTD does not cross-neutralize TcdB003 and TcdB027 toxicity against CHO cells, and TcdB027 appears to be devoid of neutralizing epitopes in this domain. These findings indicate differences in TcdB003 and TcdB027 contribute to increased virulence of C. difficile BI/NAP1/027 and reduce the likelihood of acquired immunity providing cross-protection against infection by these strains.

"Considering cells as biofactories, we aimed to optimize its internal processes by using the same engineering principles that large industries are implementing nowadays: lean manufacturing. We have applied reverse engineering computational methods to transcriptomic, metabolomic and phenomic data obtained from a collection of tomato recombinant inbreed lines to formulate a kinetic and constraint-based model that efficiently describes the cellular metabolism from expression of a minimal core of genes. Based on predicted metabolic profiles, a close association with agronomic and organoleptic properties of the ripe fruit was revealed with high statistical confidence. Inspired in a synthetic biology approach, the model was used for exploring the landscape of all possible local transcriptional changes with the aim of engineering tomato fruits with fine-tuned biotechnological properties. The method was validated by the ability of the proposed genomes, engineered for modified desired agronomic traits, to recapitulate experimental correlations between associated metabolites.
","Considering cells as biofactories, we aimed to optimize their internal processes by using existing design principles acquired from engineering. Herein, we present a synthetic biology approach based on experimental and computational methodology that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and phenomic data to formulate a kinetic and constraint based model of tomato agronomic and fruit quality characteristics. The model has been used for exploring the landscape of all possible local transcriptional changes with the aim of engineering tomato fruits with improved biotechnological properties. The methodology was validated by the ability of the proposed engineered genomes with modified desired agronomic traits, to recapitulate correlations between associated metabolites that are found experimentally in a number of examples.

"Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a rare cardiomyopathy associated with a hypertrabeculated phenotype and a large spectrum of symptoms. It is still unclear whether LVNC results from a defect of ventricular trabeculae development and the mechanistic basis that underlies the varying severity of this pathology is unknown. To investigate these issues, we inactivated the cardiac transcription factor Nkx2-5 in trabecular myocardium at different stages of trabecular morphogenesis using an inducible Cx40-creERT2 allele. Conditional deletion of Nkx2-5 at embryonic stages, during trabecular formation, provokes a severe hypertrabeculated phenotype associated with subendocardial fibrosis and Purkinje fiber hypoplasia. A milder phenotype was observed after Nkx2-5 deletion at fetal stages, during trabecular compaction. A longitudinal study of cardiac function in adult Nkx2-5 conditional mutant mice demonstrates that excessive trabeculation is associated with complex ventricular conduction defects, progressively leading to strain defects, and, in 50% of mutant mice, to heart failure. Progressive impaired cardiac function correlates with conduction and strain defects independently of the degree of hypertrabeculation. Transcriptomic analysis of molecular pathways reflects myocardial remodeling with a larger number of differentially expressed genes in the severe versus mild phenotype and identifies Six1 as being upregulated in hypertrabeculated hearts. Our results provide insights into the etiology of LVNC and link its pathogenicity with compromised trabecular development including compaction defects and ventricular conduction system hypoplasia.
","During fetal heart morphogenesis, formation of the mature ventricular wall requires coordinated compaction of the inner trabecular layer and growth of the outer layer of myocardium. Arrested trabecular development has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertrabeculation associated with ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy. However much uncertainty still exists among clinicians concerning the physiopathology of ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, including its clinical characteristics, prognosis, classification and even the definition of hypertrabeculation. In particular, distinguishing between pathological and non-pathological subtypes of non-compaction is currently a major issue. Here we show that deletion of the gene encoding the transcription factor Nkx2-5 at critical steps during trabecular development recapitulates pathological features of hypertrabeculation, providing the first model of ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy in adult mice. We demonstrate that excessive trabeculation due to failure of trabecular compaction during fetal development is associated with Purkinje fiber hypoplasia and subendocardial fibrosis. Longitudinal functional studies reveal that these mice present all the clinical signs of symptomatic left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, including conduction defects, strain defects and progressive heart failure. Our results, including transcriptomic analysis, suggest that pathological features of non-compaction are primarily developmental defects. This study clarifies the origin of the pathological outcomes associated with LVNC and may provide helpful information for clinicians concerning the etiology of this rare cardiomyopathy.

"There is a worldwide upscale in mass drug administration (MDA) programs to control the morbidity caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STHs): Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm. Although anthelminthic drugs which are used for MDA are supplied by two pharmaceutical companies through donation, there is a wide range of brands available on local markets for which the efficacy against STHs and quality remain poorly explored. In the present study, we evaluated the drug efficacy and quality of two albendazole brands (Bendex and Ovis) available on the local market in Ethiopia.
A randomized clinical trial was conducted according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to assess drug efficacy, by means of egg reduction rate (ERR), of Bendex and Ovis against STH infections in school children in Jimma, Ethiopia. In addition, the chemical and physicochemical quality of the drugs was assessed according to the United States and European Pharmacopoeia, encompassing mass uniformity of the tablets, amount of active compound and dissolution profile. Both drugs were highly efficacious against A. lumbricoides (>97%), but showed poor efficacy against T. trichiura (~20%). For hookworms, Ovis was significantly (p < 0.05) more efficacious compared to Bendex (98.1% vs. 88.7%). Assessment of the physicochemical quality of the drugs revealed a significant difference in dissolution profile, with Bendex having a slower dissolution than Ovis.
The study revealed that differences in efficacy between the two brands of albendazole (ABZ) tablets against hookworm are linked to the differences in the in-vitro drug release profile. Differences in uptake and metabolism of this benzimidazole drug among different helminth species may explain that this efficacy difference was only observed in hookworms and not in the two other species. The results of the present study underscore the importance of assessing the chemical and physicochemical quality of drugs before conducting efficacy assessment in any clinical trials to ensure appropriate therapeutic efficacy and to exclude poor drug quality as a factor of reduced drug efficacy other than anthelminthic resistance. Overall, this paper demonstrates that “all medicines are not created equal”.
","Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) infect millions of children worldwide. To fight STH, large-scale de-worming programs are implemented in which anthelmintic drugs (either albendazole (ABZ) or mebendazole (MEB)) are administered. However, there is a wide range of other brands, which are even more accessible, but for which the efficacy and quality remain poorly explored. We evaluated efficacy against STHs and quality of two ABZ brands commonly available on the local markets in Ethiopia (Bendex and Ovis). Both brands showed high efficacy against roundworm infections and poor efficacy against whipworms. However, for hookworm infections, Bendex was significantly less efficacious than Ovis. In terms of drug quality, a significant difference was observed in the dissolution profile, with Bendex having a significantly slower dissolution rate than Ovis. Since dissolution behavior is critical for a drug to be appropriately absorbed into the helminth (through host-blood and/or parasite-cuticle) and produce therapeutic efficacy, the poor dissolution of Bendex compared to Ovis can explain the observed difference in efficacy against hookworms. Our results emphasize the importance of periodically assessing of drug quality to ensure appropriate therapeutic efficacy and to exclude poor drug quality as a potential factor of reduced drug efficacy other than drug resistance.

"The metacestode (larval) stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a very severe and in many cases incurable disease. To date, benzimidazoles such as albendazole and mebendazole are the only approved chemotherapeutical treatment options. Benzimidazoles inhibit metacestode proliferation, but do not act parasiticidal. Thus, benzimidazoles have to be taken a lifelong, can cause adverse side effects such as hepatotoxicity, and are ineffective in some patients. We here describe a newly developed screening cascade for the evaluation of the in vitro efficacy of new compounds that includes assessment of parasiticidal activity. The Malaria Box from Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), comprised of 400 commercially available chemicals that show in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum, was repurposed. Primary screening was carried out at 10 μM by employing the previously described PGI assay, and resulted in the identification of 24 compounds that caused physical damage in metacestodes. Seven out of these 24 drugs were also active at 1 μM. Dose-response assays revealed that only 2 compounds, namely MMV665807 and MMV665794, exhibited an EC50 value below 5 μM. Assessments using human foreskin fibroblasts and Reuber rat hepatoma cells showed that the salicylanilide MMV665807 was less toxic for these two mammalian cell lines than for metacestodes. The parasiticidal activity of MMV665807 was then confirmed using isolated germinal layer cell cultures as well as metacestode vesicles by employing viability assays, and its effect on metacestodes was morphologically evaluated by electron microscopy. However, both oral and intraperitoneal application of MMV665807 to mice experimentally infected with E. multilocularis metacestodes did not result in any reduction of the parasite load.
","The fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis causes a deadly disease in humans that is characterized by cancer-like parasite growth in the liver of patients. Hence E. multilocularis is ideally removed by radical resection. However, as this is not always possible, patients are treated by chemotherapy to stop further parasite growth. To date, the drugs in use cannot kill the parasite E. multilocularis and they also induce side-effects, therefore new options for treatment are needed. We here screened a library of 400 compounds with proven activity against Plasmodium falciparum, the cause of malaria, for their effects against E. multilocularis in vitro. We developed and refined an in vitro screening cascade and developed an assay that can identify compounds with parasiticidal effects against E. multilocularis cells. We here show that MMV665807 acts parasiticidal as demonstrated by in vitro viability tests and by electron microscopy. In the mouse infection model the drug was not active, but work will focus on the evaluation of derivatives with improved bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties to achieve parasiticidal activity not only in vitro, but also in vivo.

"The spirochete Borrelia recurrentis is the causal agent of louse-borne relapsing fever and is transmitted to humans by the infected body louse Pediculus humanus. We have recently demonstrated that the B. recurrentis surface receptor, HcpA, specifically binds factor H, the regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation, thereby inhibiting complement mediated bacteriolysis. Here, we show that B. recurrentis spirochetes express another potential outer membrane lipoprotein, termed CihC, and acquire C4b-binding protein (C4bp) and human C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-Inh), the major inhibitors of the classical and lectin pathway of complement activation. A highly homologous receptor for C4bp was also found in the African tick-borne relapsing fever spirochete B. duttonii. Upon its binding to B. recurrentis or recombinant CihC, C4bp retains its functional potential, i.e. facilitating the factor I-mediated degradation of C4b. The additional finding that ectopic expression of CihC in serum sensitive B. burgdorferi significantly increased spirochetal resistance against human complement suggests this receptor to substantially contribute, together with other known strategies, to immune evasion of B. recurrentis.
","Borrelia recurrentis, the causal agent of louse-borne relapsing fever is transmitted to humans via infected body lice. Infection with B. recurrentis has been achieved only in humans and is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory disease, multiple relapses of fever and massive spirochetemia. A key virulence factor of B. recurrentis is their potential to undergo antigenic variation. However, for survival in the blood during the early phase of infection and for persistence in human tissues, spirochetes must be endowed with robust tools to escape innate immunity. We have recently shown that B. recurrentis acquires the serum-derived regulator factor H, thereby blocking the alternative complement pathway. Here, we show that B. recurrentis expresses in addition a novel outer surface lipoprotein that selectively binds serum-derived C4b-binding protein and C1 esterase inhibitor, two endogenous regulators of the classical and lectin pathway of complement activation. The combined data underscore the versatility of B. recurrentis to effectively evade innate and adaptive immunity, including serum resistance. Thus, the present study elucidates a new mechanism of B. recurrentis important for its evasion from complement attack and will be helpful for the development of new drugs against this fatal infection.

"Yellow fever (YF) is endemic in much of Brazil, where cases of the disease are reported every year. Since 2008, outbreaks of the disease have occurred in regions of the country where no reports had been registered for decades, which has obligated public health authorities to redefine risk areas for the disease. The aim of the present study was to propose a methodology of environmental risk analysis for defining priority municipalities for YF vaccination, using as example, the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The municipalities were divided into two groups (affected and unaffected by YF) and compared based on environmental parameters related to the disease's eco-epidemiology. Bivariate analysis was used to identify statistically significant associations between the variables and virus circulation. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to evaluate the relationship among the variables and their contribution to the dynamics of YF in Sao Paulo. The MCA generated a factor that was able to differentiate between affected and unaffected municipalities and was used to determine risk levels. This methodology can be replicated in other regions, standardized, and adapted to each context.

"Across organisms, manipulation of biosynthetic capacity arrests development early in life, but can increase health- and lifespan post-developmentally. Here we demonstrate that this developmental arrest is not sickness but rather a regulated survival program responding to reduced cellular performance. We inhibited protein synthesis by reducing ribosome biogenesis (rps-11/RPS11 RNAi), translation initiation (ifg-1/EIF3G mutation and egl-45/EIF3A RNAi), or ribosome progression (cycloheximide treatment), all of which result in a specific arrest at larval stage 2 of C. elegans development. This quiescent state can last for weeks—beyond the normal C. elegans adult lifespan—and is reversible, as animals can resume reproduction and live a normal lifespan once released from the source of protein synthesis inhibition. The arrest state affords resistance to thermal, oxidative, and heavy metal stress exposure. In addition to cell-autonomous responses, reducing biosynthetic capacity only in the hypodermis was sufficient to drive organism-level developmental arrest and stress resistance phenotypes. Among the cell non-autonomous responses to protein synthesis inhibition is reduced pharyngeal pumping that is dependent upon AMPK-mediated signaling. The reduced pharyngeal pumping in response to protein synthesis inhibition is recapitulated by exposure to microbes that generate protein synthesis-inhibiting xenobiotics, which may mechanistically reduce ingestion of pathogen and toxin. These data define the existence of a transient arrest-survival state in response to protein synthesis inhibition and provide an evolutionary foundation for the conserved enhancement of healthy aging observed in post-developmental animals with reduced biosynthetic capacity.
","Protein synthesis is an essential cellular process, but post-developmental reduction of protein synthesis across multiple species leads to improved health- and lifespan. To better understand the physiological responses to impaired protein synthesis, we characterize a novel developmental arrest state that occurs when reducing protein synthesis during C. elegans development. Arrested animals have multiple survival-promoting phenotypes that are all dependent on the cellular energy sensor, AMP kinase. This survival response acts through the hypodermis and causes a reduction in pharyngeal pumping, indicating that the animal is responding to a perceived external threat, even in adults. Furthermore, exposing animals to pathogens, or xenobiotics they produce, can recapitulate these phenotypes, providing a potential evolutionary explanation for how a beneficial response in adults could evolve through the inhibition of an essential biological process such as protein synthesis.

"Animal tungiasis is believed to increase the prevalence and parasite burden in humans. Animal reservoirs of Tunga penetrans differ among endemic areas and their role in the epidemiology of tungiasis had never been investigated in Uganda.
To identify the major animal reservoirs of Tunga penetrans and their relative importance in the transmission of tungiasis in Uganda, a cross sectional study was conducted in animal rearing households in 10 endemic villages in Bugiri District. T. penetrans infections were detected in pigs, dogs, goats and a cat. The prevalences of households with tungiasis ranged from 0% to 71.4% (median 22.2) for animals and from 5 to 71.4% (median 27.8%) for humans. The prevalence of human tungiasis also varied among the population of the villages (median 7%, range 1.3–37.3%). Pig infections had the widest distribution (nine out of 10 villages) and highest prevalence (median 16.2%, range 0–64.1%). Pigs also had a higher number of embedded sand fleas than all other species combined (p<0.0001). Dog tungiasis occurred in five out of 10 villages with low prevalences (median of 2%, range 0–26.9%). Only two goats and a single cat had tungiasis. Prevalences of animal and human tungiasis correlated at both village (rho = 0.89, p = 0.0005) and household (rho = 0.4, p<0.0001) levels. The median number of lesions in household animals correlated with the median intensity of infection in children three to eight years of age (rho = 0.47, p<0.0001). Animal tungiasis increased the odds of occurrence of human cases in households six fold (OR = 6.1, 95% CI 3.3–11.4, p<0.0001).
Animal and human tungiasis were closely associated and pigs were identified as the most important animal hosts of T. penetrans. Effective tungiasis control should follow One Health principles and integrate ectoparasites control in animals.
","Tungiasis is a neglected skin disease, frequent in resource-poor communities in the tropics. It is caused by sand fleas (also called jigger fleas) which burrow in the skin of humans and animals. Tungiasis can cause physical disabilities and the associated wounds facilitate entry of pathogens including those causing tetanus. In Brazil, presence of tungiasis in animals increased the risk and severity of the human disease. Until now, no systematic studies on animal tungiasis in Africa have been conducted. Therefore, an epidemiological study was performed in Busoga sub-region, where tungiasis in humans is very common. Tungiasis was detected in pigs, dogs, goats and a cat, respectively, in their order of significance. Animal tungiasis was strongly associated with human tungiasis and the presence of the disease in animals increased the risk of human infection by a factor of six. Our findings confirmed, for the first time, a strong correlation between the presence of tungiasis in animal reservoirs and the human population in Africa. Therefore, control of tungiasis in animals should be integrated in all interventions geared at controlling tungiasis in endemic communities.

"Fourteen different active Trypanosoma congolense trans-sialidases (TconTS), 11 variants of TconTS1 besides TconTS2, TconTS3 and TconTS4, have been described. Notably, the specific transfer and sialidase activities of these TconTS differ by orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, phylogenetic analysis of the catalytic domains (CD) grouped each of the highly active TconTS together with the less active enzymes. In contrast, when aligning lectin-like domains (LD), the highly active TconTS grouped together, leading to the hypothesis that the LD of TconTS modulates its enzymatic activity. So far, little is known about the function and ligand specificity of these LDs. To explore their carbohydrate-binding potential, glycan array analysis was performed on the LD of TconTS1, TconTS2, TconTS3 and TconTS4. In addition, Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR experiments were done on TconTS2-LD for a more detailed analysis of its lectin activity. Several mannose-containing oligosaccharides, such as mannobiose, mannotriose and higher mannosylated glycans, as well as Gal, GalNAc and LacNAc containing oligosaccharides were confirmed as binding partners of TconTS1-LD and TconTS2-LD. Interestingly, terminal mannose residues are not acceptor substrates for TconTS activity. This indicates a different, yet unknown biological function for TconTS-LD, including specific interactions with oligomannose-containing glycans on glycoproteins and GPI anchors found on the surface of the parasite, including the TconTS itself. Experimental evidence for such a scenario is presented.
","In this study we demonstrated the binding of TconTS lectin domains (TconTS-LD) to high-mannose N-glycans and provide evidence for a biological function for this interaction. TconTS1 and TconTS2 lectin domain bind to galactosyl as well as mannosyl glycans with different affinities as shown by glycan array analysis. Along this line, we have also demonstrated binding of TconTS-LD to high-mannose N-glycans on glycoproteins, which is competitively inhibited by the corresponding free high-mannose N-glycans, underlining the TconTS-LD substrate specificities. TconTS1 dimerisation is mediated by TconTS-LD binding to its N-glycans and enzymatic N-deglycosylation of TconTS leads to an increase of monomers. STD NMR results obtained indicate that oligo-mannosylated glycans bind to TconTS-LD to a different site than lactose. In summary, this is good evidence that the lectin domains of TconTS1 and TconTS2 play relevant roles modulating the biological functions of these and possibly other trans-sialidases. Further detailed analysis on TconTS-LD and its role in enzyme activity will lead to a better understanding and possibly to new strategies against Nagana in livestock.

"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus indigenous to tropical Africa and Asia. Acute illness is characterized by fever, arthralgias, conjunctivitis, rash, and sometimes arthritis. Relatively little is known about the antigenic targets for immunity, and no licensed vaccines or therapeutics are currently available for the pathogen. While the Aedes aegypti mosquito is its primary vector, recent evidence suggests that other carriers can transmit CHIKV thus raising concerns about its spread outside of natural endemic areas to new countries including the U.S. and Europe. Considering the potential for pandemic spread, understanding the development of immunity is paramount to the development of effective counter measures against CHIKV. In this study, we isolated a new CHIKV virus from an acutely infected human patient and developed a defined viral challenge stock in mice that allowed us to study viral pathogenesis and develop a viral neutralization assay. We then constructed a synthetic DNA vaccine delivered by in vivo electroporation (EP) that expresses a component of the CHIKV envelope glycoprotein and used this model to evaluate its efficacy. Vaccination induced robust antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, which individually were capable of providing protection against CHIKV challenge in mice. Furthermore, vaccine studies in rhesus macaques demonstrated induction of nAb responses, which mimicked those induced in convalescent human patient sera. These data suggest a protective role for nAb against CHIKV disease and support further study of envelope-based CHIKV DNA vaccines.
","Chikungunya fever epidemics are sustained by a cycle of human-mosquito-human transmission, with the epidemic cycle being similar to those of dengue and urban yellow fever. While the threat of a pandemic continues to engage the public's attention, the peculiar problems associated with the more immediate and very real seasonal epidemics are also worthy of consideration. Specifically, there are limited viral strains that have been characterized and available for laboratory study as well as limited knowledge of immune responses induced to the virus. In this study, we isolated CHIKV virus from an acutely infected human patient and used this new virus to develop a neutralization assay and a challenge stock, which is effective in a mouse model. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of an envelope-based synthetic DNA-based vaccine to impact viral disease in the mouse model and to generate protective levels of immune responses in nonhuman primates. We observed that this novel vaccine approach generated protective levels of immune responses in both mouse and non-human primate models. We believe that these studies advance the field of Chikungunya vaccine research as well as the study of immune protection to CHIKV.

"Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is the nematode responsible for a devastating epidemic of pine wilt disease in Asia and Europe, and represents a recent, independent origin of plant parasitism in nematodes, ecologically and taxonomically distinct from other nematodes for which genomic data is available. As well as being an important pathogen, the B. xylophilus genome thus provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution and mechanism of plant parasitism. Here, we present a high-quality draft genome sequence from an inbred line of B. xylophilus, and use this to investigate the biological basis of its complex ecology which combines fungal feeding, plant parasitic and insect-associated stages. We focus particularly on putative parasitism genes as well as those linked to other key biological processes and demonstrate that B. xylophilus is well endowed with RNA interference effectors, peptidergic neurotransmitters (including the first description of ins genes in a parasite) stress response and developmental genes and has a contracted set of chemosensory receptors. B. xylophilus has the largest number of digestive proteases known for any nematode and displays expanded families of lysosome pathway genes, ABC transporters and cytochrome P450 pathway genes. This expansion in digestive and detoxification proteins may reflect the unusual diversity in foods it exploits and environments it encounters during its life cycle. In addition, B. xylophilus possesses a unique complement of plant cell wall modifying proteins acquired by horizontal gene transfer, underscoring the impact of this process on the evolution of plant parasitism by nematodes. Together with the lack of proteins homologous to effectors from other plant parasitic nematodes, this confirms the distinctive molecular basis of plant parasitism in the Bursaphelenchus lineage. The genome sequence of B. xylophilus adds to the diversity of genomic data for nematodes, and will be an important resource in understanding the biology of this unusual parasite.
","Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is an important plant pathogen, responsible for an epidemic of pine wilt disease in Asia and Europe. B. xylophilus has acquired the ability to parasitise plants independently from other economically important nematodes and has a complex life cycle that includes fungal feeding and a stage associated with an insect, as well as plant parasitism. We have sequenced the genome of B. xylophilus and used it as a resource to understand disease mechanisms and the biological basis of its complex ecology. The ability to break down cellulose, the major component of the plant cell wall, is a major problem for plant parasitic nematodes as few animals can produce the required enzymes (cellulases). Previous work has shown that other plant parasitic nematodes have acquired cellulases from bacteria but we show that all Bursaphelenchus cellulases were most likely acquired independently from fungi. We also describe a complex set of genes encoding enzymes that can break down proteins and other molecules, perhaps reflecting the range of organisms with which B. xylophilus interacts during its life cycle. The genome sequence of Bursaphelenchus represents an important step forward in understanding its biology, and will contribute to efforts to control the devastating disease it causes.

"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders associated with conversion of normal host prion protein (PrP) to a misfolded, protease-resistant form (PrPres). Genetic variations of prion protein in humans and animals can alter susceptibility to both familial and infectious prion diseases. The N171S PrP polymorphism is found mainly in humans of African descent, but its low incidence has precluded study of its possible influence on prion disease. Similar to previous experiments of others, for laboratory studies we created a transgenic model expressing the mouse PrP homolog, PrP-170S, of human PrP-171S. Since PrP polymorphisms can vary in their effects on different TSE diseases, we tested these mice with four different strains of mouse-adapted scrapie. Whereas 22L and ME7 scrapie strains induced typical clinical disease, neuropathology and accumulation of PrPres in all transgenic mice at 99-128 average days post-inoculation, strains RML and 79A produced clinical disease and PrPres formation in only a small subset of mice at very late times. When mice expressing both PrP-170S and PrP-170N were inoculated with RML scrapie, dominant-negative inhibition of disease did not occur, possibly because interaction of strain RML with PrP-170S was minimal. Surprisingly, in vitro PrP conversion using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), did not reproduce the in vivo findings, suggesting that the resistance noted in live mice might be due to factors or conditions not present in vitro. These findings suggest that in vivo conversion of PrP-170S by RML and 79A scrapie strains was slow and inefficient. PrP-170S mice may be an example of the conformational selection model where the structure of some prion strains does not favor interactions with PrP molecules expressing certain polymorphisms.
","Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or prion diseases are infectious fatal neurological diseases that affect many mammals, including humans. In these diseases a misfolded form of host prion protein (PrP) leads to brain degeneration and death. The genetic code of PrP in individual animals or humans has minor variations, which in some cases are associated with altered susceptibility to disease. In humans a variation at residue 171 (N171S) has been found in people mainly of African descent. However, due to the low incidence of the variation and difficult accessibility of these individuals, studies of prion diseases in these populations have not been carried out. Therefore, to create a laboratory animal model to study the effect of this variation on prion diseases, we generated transgenic mice expressing the mouse version of the human PrP variation at residue 171. We then studied the susceptibility of these mice to 4 strains of mouse-adapted scrapie. In our experiments these transgenic mice were uniquely resistant to two scrapie strains, but showed high sensitivity to two others. This resistance appeared to be related to a slow or inefficient generation of the aggregated disease-associated form of PrP in these mice, and was not duplicated using in vitro assays. In summary, transgenic mice expressing this variant PrP provide an interesting model to study differences among prion strains and their interactions with PrP in vivo.

"Most monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) head domain exhibit very limited breadth of inhibitory activity due to antigenic drift in field strains. However, mAb 1F1, isolated from a 1918 influenza pandemic survivor, inhibits select human H1 viruses (1918, 1943, 1947, and 1977 isolates). The crystal structure of 1F1 in complex with the 1918 HA shows that 1F1 contacts residues that are classically defined as belonging to three distinct antigenic sites, Sa, Sb and Ca2. The 1F1 heavy chain also reaches into the receptor binding site (RBS) and interacts with residues that contact sialoglycan receptors and determine HA receptor specificity. The 1F1 epitope is remarkably similar to the previously described murine HC63 H3 epitope, despite significant sequence differences between H1 and H3 HAs. Both antibodies potently inhibit receptor binding, but only HC63 can block the pH-induced conformational changes in HA that drive membrane fusion. Contacts within the RBS suggested that 1F1 may be sensitive to changes that alter HA receptor binding activity. Affinity assays confirmed that sequence changes that switch the HA to avian receptor specificity affect binding of 1F1 and a mAb possessing a closely related heavy chain, 1I20. To characterize 1F1 cross-reactivity, additional escape mutant selection and site-directed mutagenesis were performed. Residues 190 and 227 in the 1F1 epitope were found to be critical for 1F1 reactivity towards 1918, 1943 and 1977 HAs, as well as for 1I20 reactivity towards the 1918 HA. Therefore, 1F1 heavy-chain interactions with conserved RBS residues likely contribute to its ability to inhibit divergent HAs.
","Influenza infection kills thousands of people every year and causes major pandemics every few decades. The most lethal outbreak of influenza known was the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 20 to 100 million people. The 1918 virus was likely introduced into the human population from birds. We previously described five human neutralizing antibodies from survivors of the 1918 pandemic that bind the hemagglutinin (HA) surface antigen. Here, we define the binding sites of antibodies 1F1 and 1I20 on the 1918 HA and demonstrate that these overlap with the glycan receptor binding site. The glycan specificity differs between human and avian viruses for the linkages of the sialylated sugar receptors [human (α2–6) or avian (α2–3)]. 1F1 and 1I20 binds viruses that contain HA residues that mediate preference for α2–6 sialylated sugars. Three other control antibodies were not affected by preferences for the linkages of the sialylated sugar receptors because they bind elsewhere. Since the receptor-binding site is relatively conserved, this may explain the cross-reactivity of 1F1 and the enhanced binding of 1F1 and 1I20 to HAs with human receptor specificity.

"Discrete clusters of circadian clock neurons temporally organize daily behaviors such as sleep and wake. In Drosophila, a network of just 150 neurons drives two peaks of timed activity in the morning and evening. A subset of these neurons expresses the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), which is important for promoting morning behavior as well as maintaining robust free-running rhythmicity in constant conditions. Yet, how PDF acts on downstream circuits to mediate rhythmic behavior is unknown. Using circuit-directed rescue of PDF receptor mutants, we show that PDF targeting of just ∼30 non-PDF evening circadian neurons is sufficient to drive morning behavior. This function is not accompanied by large changes in core molecular oscillators in light-dark, indicating that PDF RECEPTOR likely regulates the output of these cells under these conditions. We find that PDF also acts on this focused set of non-PDF neurons to regulate both evening activity phase and period length, consistent with modest resetting effects on core oscillators. PDF likely acts on more distributed pacemaker neuron targets, including the PDF neurons themselves, to regulate rhythmic strength. Here we reveal defining features of the circuit-diagram for PDF peptide function in circadian behavior, revealing the direct neuronal targets of PDF as well as its behavioral functions at those sites. These studies define a key direct output circuit sufficient for multiple PDF dependent behaviors.
","Animals depend on being awake at the right time of day to find food and mates and fend off predators. Circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain play a crucial role in timing of specific behaviors to the appropriate times of day. These neurons are further specialized to those primarily responsible for morning and evening behavior. We have used the fruit fly Drosophila as a simple model system to elucidate the neural circuits important for timed daily behavior. In flies, a small group of clock neurons devoted to morning behavior express a neuropeptide, PIGMENT DISPERSING FACTOR (PDF). Until now it was unclear what the direct neural targets of this peptide are and how its actions at those targets mediate timed behavior. Here we find that the so-called morning clock neurons communicate directly to other clock neurons, those responsible for evening behavior. This communication sustains high amplitude morning activity and sets the phase of evening activity as well as the period of activity rhythms in constant conditions. These studies reveal the circuit diagram for PDF function in circadian behavior.

"Rabies is endemic in Sri Lanka, but little is known about the temporal and spatial trends of rabies in this country. Knowing these trends may provide insight into past control efforts and serve as the basis for future control measures. In this study, we analyzed distribution of rabies in humans and animals over a period of 12 years in Sri Lanka.
Accumulated data from 1999 through 2010 compiled by the Department of Rabies Diagnosis and Research, Medical Research Institute (MRI), Colombo, were used in this study.
The yearly mean percentage of rabies-positive sample was 62.4% (47.6–75.9%). Three-fourths of the rabies-positive samples were from the Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara districts in Western province, followed by Galle in Southern province. A high percentage of the rabies samples were from dogs (85.2%), followed by cats (7.9%), humans (3.8%), wild animals (2.0%), and livestock (1.1%). Among wild animals, mongooses were the main victims followed by civets. The number of suspect human rabies cases decreased gradually in Sri Lanka, although the number of human samples submitted for laboratory confirmation increased.
The number of rabid dogs has remained relatively unchanged, but the number of suspect human rabies is decreasing gradually in Sri Lanka. These findings indicate successful use of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) by animal bite victims and increased rabies awareness. PEP is free of charge and is supplied through government hospitals by the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka. Our survey shows that most positive samples were received from Western and Southern provinces, possibly because of the ease of transporting samples to the laboratory. Submissions of wild animal and livestock samples should be increased by creating more awareness among the public. Better rabies surveillance will require introduction of molecular methods for detection and the establishment of more regional rabies diagnostic laboratories.
","Rabies is a public health concern in Sri Lanka. The incidence of dog rabies remains unchanged, but the incidence of suspect human rabies is decreasing gradually in Sri Lanka. This finding indicates the effects of improved access to postexposure prophylaxis by animal bite victims and increased rabies awareness. As in other rabies-endemic countries, in Sri Lanka, human rabies is transmitted mainly by dogs, although domestic and wild animals have been diagnosed rabid, and can pose a risk of exposure to humans. In this study, we analyzed 12 years of data accumulated in the national reference laboratory of Sri Lanka to identify the trends of rabies in this country. This study showed that rabies has been recorded mainly in Western and Southern Provinces of Sri Lanka, possibly because of the ease of communication with rabies diagnostic laboratories from these areas. Regional rabies diagnosis laboratories should be established to improve surveillance of rabies in Sri Lanka. There were few submitted animal samples from livestock and wild animals, indicating that greater awareness is needed among the public regarding the need to submit suspect rabid animals for diagnostic evaluation. These data could help policy makers improve rabies prevention and to control rabies in Sri Lanka.

"Protein synthesis-dependent, late long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) at glutamatergic hippocampal synapses are well characterized examples of long-term synaptic plasticity. Persistent increased activity of protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Additional spatial and temporal features that govern LTP and LTD induction are embodied in the synaptic tagging and capture (STC) and cross capture hypotheses. Only synapses that have been “tagged” by a stimulus sufficient for LTP and learning can “capture” PKMζ. A model was developed to simulate the dynamics of key molecules required for LTP and LTD. The model concisely represents relationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. The model successfully simulated LTP maintained by persistent synaptic PKMζ, STC, LTD, and cross capture, and makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKMζ. The maintenance of LTP, and consequently of at least some forms of long-term memory, is predicted to require continual positive feedback in which PKMζ enhances its own synthesis only at potentiated synapses. This feedback underlies bistability in the activity of PKMζ. Second, cross capture requires the induction of LTD to induce dendritic PKMζ synthesis, although this may require tagging of a nearby synapse for LTP. The model also simulates the effects of PKMζ inhibition, and makes additional predictions for the dynamics of CaM kinases. Experiments testing the above predictions would significantly advance the understanding of memory maintenance.
","A fundamental problem in neurobiology is to understand how memories are maintained for up to years. Long-term potentiation (LTP), an enduring increase in the strength of specific connections (synapses) between neurons, is thought to comprise, at least in part, the substrate of learning and memory. What processes transduce brief stimuli into persistent LTP? Persistent increased activity of an enzyme denoted protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Only synapses that have been “tagged” by a stimulus, such as stimuli needed for LTP and learning, can “capture” PKMζ. We developed a model simulating dynamics of key molecules required for LTP and its opposite, long-term depression (LTD). The model concisely represents relationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. It makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKMζ. The maintenance of LTP and memory is predicted to require positive feedback in which PKMζ enhances its own synthesis at potentiated synapses. Without synaptic capture of PKMζ, no positive feedback would occur. LTD induction is also predicted to increase PKMζ synthesis. The model also makes predictions about regulation of PKMζ synthesis. Experiments testing the above predictions would advance the understanding of memory maintenance.

"One of the few commonly believed principles of molecular evolution is that functionally more important genes (or DNA sequences) evolve more slowly than less important ones. This principle is widely used by molecular biologists in daily practice. However, recent genomic analysis of a diverse array of organisms found only weak, negative correlations between the evolutionary rate of a gene and its functional importance, typically measured under a single benign lab condition. A frequently suggested cause of the above finding is that gene importance determined in the lab differs from that in an organism's natural environment. Here, we test this hypothesis in yeast using gene importance values experimentally determined in 418 lab conditions or computationally predicted for 10,000 nutritional conditions. In no single condition or combination of conditions did we find a much stronger negative correlation, which is explainable by our subsequent finding that always-essential (enzyme) genes do not evolve significantly more slowly than sometimes-essential or always-nonessential ones. Furthermore, we verified that functional density, approximated by the fraction of amino acid sites within protein domains, is uncorrelated with gene importance. Thus, neither the lab-nature mismatch nor a potentially biased among-gene distribution of functional density explains the observed weakness of the correlation between gene importance and evolutionary rate. We conclude that the weakness is factual, rather than artifactual. In addition to being weakened by population genetic reasons, the correlation is likely to have been further weakened by the presence of multiple nontrivial rate determinants that are independent from gene importance. These findings notwithstanding, we show that the principle of slower evolution of more important genes does have some predictive power when genes with vastly different evolutionary rates are compared, explaining why the principle can be practically useful despite the weakness of the correlation.

"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) constitute a major source of type-I interferon (IFN-I) production during acute HIV infection. Their activation results primarily from TLR7-mediated sensing of HIV-infected cells. However, the interactions between HIV-infected T cells and pDCs that modulate this sensing process remain poorly understood. BST2/Tetherin is a restriction factor that inhibits HIV release by cross-linking virions onto infected cell surface. BST2 was also shown to engage the ILT7 pDC-specific inhibitory receptor and repress TLR7/9-mediated IFN-I production by activated pDCs. Here, we show that Vpu, the HIV-1 antagonist of BST2, suppresses TLR7-mediated IFN-I production by pDC through a mechanism that relies on the interaction of BST2 on HIV-producing cells with ILT7. Even though Vpu downregulates surface BST2 as a mean to counteract the restriction on HIV-1 release, we also find that the viral protein re-locates remaining BST2 molecules outside viral assembly sites where they are free to bind and activate ILT7 upon cell-to-cell contact. This study shows that through a targeted regulation of surface BST2, Vpu promotes HIV-1 release and limits pDC antiviral responses upon sensing of infected cells. This mechanism of innate immune evasion is likely to be important for an efficient early viral dissemination during acute infection.
","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce large quantities of type I interferon (IFN-I) upon stimulation by many viruses, including HIV. Their activation is very effective following cell contacts with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. We investigated whether HIV-1 could regulate the antiviral responses of pDCs triggered upon sensing of infected cells. We show that HIV-1 suppresses the levels of IFN-I produced by pDCs through a process that requires expression of the Vpu accessory protein in virus-producing cells. A well-described role of Vpu is to promote efficient HIV-1 production by counteracting BST2, a host factor that entraps nascent viral particle at the cell surface. Apart from its antiviral activity, BST2 was reported to inhibit IFN-I production by pDCs through binding and activation of the ILT7 pDC-specific inhibitory receptor. Our results reveal that through a highly sophisticated targeted regulation of BST2 levels at the surface of infected cells, Vpu promotes HIV-1 release and limits IFN-I production by pDCs via the negative signaling exerted by the BST2-ILT7 pair. Overall, this study sheds light on a novel Vpu-BST2 interaction that allows HIV-1 to escape pDC antiviral responses. This modulation of pDC antiviral response by HIV Vpu may facilitate the initial viral expansion during acute infection.

"Eliciting broad tier 2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) is a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research. Here we investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed JR-FL Env trimers to elicit nAbs. Unusually potent nAb titers developed in 2 of 8 rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers (trimer VLP sera) and in 1 of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost (DNA trimer sera). All 3 sera neutralized via quaternary epitopes and exploited natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of JR-FL gp120. Specifically, trimer VLP sera took advantage of the unusual absence of a glycan at residue 197 (present in 98.7% of Envs). Intriguingly, removing the N197 glycan (with no loss of tier 2 phenotype) rendered 50% or 16.7% (n = 18) of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to the two trimer VLP sera, showing broad neutralization via the surface masked by the N197 glycan. Neutralizing sera targeted epitopes that overlap with the CD4 binding site, consistent with the role of the N197 glycan in a putative “glycan fence” that limits access to this region. A bioinformatics analysis suggested shared features of one of the trimer VLP sera and monoclonal antibody PG9, consistent with its trimer-dependency. The neutralizing DNA trimer serum took advantage of the absence of a glycan at residue 230, also proximal to the CD4 binding site and suggesting an epitope similar to that of monoclonal antibody 8ANC195, albeit lacking tier 2 breadth. Taken together, our data show for the first time that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes. Moreover, cross-neutralization can occur in the absence of protecting glycan. Overall, our observations provide new insights that may inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine.
","Here we show that native HIV-1 Env spikes expressed in a natural membrane context can induce potent tier 2 nAbs in rabbits. These antibodies reacted exclusively with epitopes present on these trimers and not with isolated Env subunits. Intriguingly, the neutralizing sera were found to take advantage of natural gaps in the carbohydrate defenses of Env spikes of the vaccine strain. Some sera were able to neutralize heterologous isolates, provided that a key, regulating glycan was removed. Overall, these findings suggest that native, membrane-expressed trimers hold promise for further development as vaccine candidates. In the future, by adapting our current findings, we might be able to encourage nAb development to key conserved sites by introducing additional, targeted gaps in the trimer's glycan shell. We suggest that the rare ability to predictably induce potent autologous neutralizing antibodies to field isolates, as we report here, provides a foundation for exploring new strategies aimed at inducing neutralization breadth which is widely expected to be essential for vaccine-induced protection.

"Although the Factor V Leiden (FVL) gene variant is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis, only 10% of FVL carriers will experience such an event in their lifetime. To identify potential FVL modifier genes contributing to this incomplete penetrance, we took advantage of a perinatal synthetic lethal thrombosis phenotype in mice homozygous for FVL (F5L/L) and haploinsufficient for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (Tfpi+/-) to perform a sensitized dominant ENU mutagenesis screen. Linkage analysis conducted in the 3 largest pedigrees generated from the surviving F5L/L Tfpi+/- mice (‘rescues’) using ENU-induced coding variants as genetic markers was unsuccessful in identifying major suppressor loci. Whole exome sequencing was applied to DNA from 107 rescue mice to identify candidate genes enriched for ENU mutations. A total of 3,481 potentially deleterious candidate ENU variants were identified in 2,984 genes. After correcting for gene size and multiple testing, Arl6ip5 was identified as the most enriched gene, though not reaching genome-wide significance. Evaluation of CRISPR/Cas9 induced loss of function in the top 6 genes failed to demonstrate a clear rescue phenotype. However, a maternally inherited (not ENU-induced) de novo mutation (Plcb4R335Q) exhibited significant co-segregation with the rescue phenotype (p = 0.003) in the corresponding pedigree. Thrombosis suppression by heterozygous Plcb4 loss of function was confirmed through analysis of an independent, CRISPR/Cas9-induced Plcb4 mutation (p = 0.01).
","Abnormal blood clotting in veins (venous thrombosis) or arteries (arterial thrombosis) are major health problems, with venous thrombosis affecting approximately 1 in every thousand individuals annually in the United States. Susceptibility to venous thrombosis is governed by both genes and environment, with approximately 60% of the risk attributed to genetic influences. Though several genetic risk factors are known, >50% of genetic risk remains unexplained. Approximately 5% of people carry the most common known risk factor, Factor V Leiden. However, only 10% of these individuals will develop a blood clot in their lifetime. Mice carrying two copies of the Factor V Leiden mutation together with a mutation in a second gene called tissue factor pathway inhibitor develop fatal thrombosis shortly after birth. To identify genes that prevent this fatal thrombosis, we studied a large panel of mice carrying inactivating gene changes randomly distributed throughout the genome. We identified several genes as potential candidates to alter blood clotting balance in mice and humans with predisposition to thrombosis, and confirmed this protective function for DNA changes in one of these genes (Plcb4).

"Using A/J mice, which are susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus, we sought to identify genetic determinants of susceptibility to S. aureus, and evaluate their function with regard to S. aureus infection. One QTL region on chromosome 11 containing 422 genes was found to be significantly associated with susceptibility to S. aureus infection. Of these 422 genes, whole genome transcription profiling identified five genes (Dcaf7, Dusp3, Fam134c, Psme3, and Slc4a1) that were significantly differentially expressed in a) S. aureus –infected susceptible (A/J) vs. resistant (C57BL/6J) mice and b) humans with S. aureus blood stream infection vs. healthy subjects. Three of these genes (Dcaf7, Dusp3, and Psme3) were down-regulated in susceptible vs. resistant mice at both pre- and post-infection time points by qPCR. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Dusp3 and Psme3 induced significant increases of cytokine production in S. aureus-challenged RAW264.7 macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) through enhancing NF-κB signaling activity. Similar increases in cytokine production and NF-κB activity were also seen in BMDMs from CSS11 (C57BL/6J background with chromosome 11 from A/J), but not C57BL/6J. These findings suggest that Dusp3 and Psme3 contribute to S. aureus infection susceptibility in A/J mice and play a role in human S. aureus infection.
","Staphylococcus aureus causes life-threatening infections in humans. Host genetic determinants influence the outcome of S. aureus infection, yet are poorly understood. Susceptible A/J and resistant C57BL/6J mice provide a unique platform to study the genetic difference responsible for variable host response to S. aureus infection. We showed that chromosome 11 in A/J was responsible for susceptibility to S. aureus. We further identified a QTL locus on Chromosome 11 significantly associated with S. aureus susceptibility. Five genes in the QTL (Dcaf7, Dusp3, Fam134c, Psme3, and Slc4a1) were significantly differently expressed in a) susceptible vs. resistant mice, and b) humans with S. aureus blood stream infection vs. healthy human subjects. Three genes (Dusp3, Psme3, and Dcaf7) were down-regulated in susceptible A/J mice. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Dusp3 and Psme3 in bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDMs) significantly enhanced cytokine responses through NF-κB activity upon S. aureus challenge in a pattern that was also present in S. aureus-challenged BMDMs from susceptible CSS11 (chr. 11 from A/J but otherwise C57BL/6J) mice, but not resistant C57BL/6J mice. These findings suggest that Dusp3 and Psme3 contribute to S. aureus infection susceptibility in A/J mice and play a role in human S. aureus infection.

"Immune defense is energetically costly, and thus an effective response requires metabolic adaptation of the organism to reallocate energy from storage, growth, and development towards the immune system. We employ the natural infection of Drosophila with a parasitoid wasp to study energy regulation during immune response. To combat the invasion, the host must produce specialized immune cells (lamellocytes) that destroy the parasitoid egg. We show that a significant portion of nutrients are allocated to differentiating lamellocytes when they would otherwise be used for development. This systemic metabolic switch is mediated by extracellular adenosine released from immune cells. The switch is crucial for an effective immune response. Preventing adenosine transport from immune cells or blocking adenosine receptor precludes the metabolic switch and the deceleration of development, dramatically reducing host resistance. Adenosine thus serves as a signal that the “selfish” immune cells send during infection to secure more energy at the expense of other tissues.
","The immune response is energetically costly and often requires adaption of the whole organism to ensure it receives enough energy. It is not well understood how distribution of energy resources within the organism is regulated during an immune response. To understand this better, we used parasitoid wasp infection of fruit fly larvae—the host larvae have 48 h before they pupate to destroy the infecting “alien” or face destruction by the parasitoid that will consume the developing pupa. Here we find a signal, generated by the host immune cells, which mediates a systemic energy switch. This signal—adenosine—suppresses processes driving larval to pupal development of the host, thereby freeing up energy for the immune system. We show that the resulting developmental delay in the fruit fly larvae is crucial for an efficient immune response; without the adenosine signal, resistance to the parasitoid drops drastically. Generation of this signal by immune cells demonstrates that in response to external stressors, the immune system can mobilize reallocation to itself of energy and nutrients from the rest of the organism.

"Drosophila is a well recognized model of several human diseases, and recent investigations have demonstrated that Drosophila can be used as a model of human heart failure. Previously, we described that optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to rapidly examine the cardiac function in adult, awake flies. This technique provides images that are similar to echocardiography in humans, and therefore we postulated that this approach could be combined with the vast resources that are available in the fly community to identify new mutants that have abnormal heart function, a hallmark of certain cardiovascular diseases. Using OCT to examine the cardiac function in adult Drosophila from a set of molecularly-defined genomic deficiencies from the DrosDel and Exelixis collections, we identified an abnormally enlarged cardiac chamber in a series of deficiency mutants spanning the rhomboid 3 locus. Rhomboid 3 is a member of a highly conserved family of intramembrane serine proteases and processes Spitz, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like ligand. Using multiple approaches based on the examination of deficiency stocks, a series of mutants in the rhomboid-Spitz–EGF receptor pathway, and cardiac-specific transgenic rescue or dominant-negative repression of EGFR, we demonstrate that rhomboid 3 mediated activation of the EGF receptor pathway is necessary for proper adult cardiac function. The importance of EGF receptor signaling in the adult Drosophila heart underscores the concept that evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanisms are required to maintain normal myocardial function. Interestingly, prior work showing the inhibition of ErbB2, a member of the EGF receptor family, in transgenic knock-out mice or individuals that received herceptin chemotherapy is associated with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Our results, in conjunction with the demonstration that altered ErbB2 signaling underlies certain forms of mammalian cardiomyopathy, suggest that an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism may be necessary to maintain post-developmental cardiac function.
","Heart failure is a common cardiovascular disease that is characterized by problems with the ability of the heart muscle to contract, called impaired systolic function, and an enlarged heart chamber. Model systems of human heart failure are necessary to facilitate the screening and identification of genes and genetic variations that either cause or influence the development and progression of this disease. To better understand these genes, we conducted a genetic screen employing molecularly defined deletions throughout the genome of the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We used an optical coherence tomography imaging technique that provided images similar to echocardiography in humans to measure the cardiac function in adult flies. We identified mutants in members of the rhomboid protease family and epidermal growth factor receptor that cause an enlarged cardiac chamber. Interestingly, abnormalities in the function of members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family in humans that undergo certain chemotherapies are associated with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Our results suggest that epidermal growth factor receptor signaling may be an evolutionarily conserved pathway that is necessary to maintain normal adult cardiac function.

"The essential transactivator function of the HIV Tat protein is regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications. Although individual modifications are well characterized, their crosstalk and dynamics of occurrence during the HIV transcription cycle remain unclear.
We examine interactions between two critical modifications within the RNA-binding domain of Tat: monomethylation of lysine 51 (K51) mediated by Set7/9/KMT7, an early event in the Tat transactivation cycle that strengthens the interaction of Tat with TAR RNA, and acetylation of lysine 50 (K50) mediated by p300/KAT3B, a later process that dissociates the complex formed by Tat, TAR RNA and the cyclin T1 subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). We find K51 monomethylation inhibited in synthetic Tat peptides carrying an acetyl group at K50 while acetylation can occur in methylated peptides, albeit at a reduced rate. To examine whether Tat is subject to sequential monomethylation and acetylation in cells, we performed mass spectrometry on immunoprecipitated Tat proteins and generated new modification-specific Tat antibodies against monomethylated/acetylated Tat. No bimodified Tat protein was detected in cells pointing to a demethylation step during the Tat transactivation cycle. We identify lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1) as a Tat K51-specific demethylase, which is required for the activation of HIV transcription in latently infected T cells. LSD1/KDM1 and its cofactor CoREST associates with the HIV promoter in vivo and activate Tat transcriptional activity in a K51-dependent manner. In addition, small hairpin RNAs directed against LSD1/KDM1 or inhibition of its activity with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine suppresses the activation of HIV transcription in latently infected T cells.
Our data support the model that a LSD1/KDM1/CoREST complex, normally known as a transcriptional suppressor, acts as a novel activator of HIV transcription through demethylation of K51 in Tat. Small molecule inhibitors of LSD1/KDM1 show therapeutic promise by enforcing HIV latency in infected T cells.
","One of the remaining questions in HIV research is how the virus establishes a dormant (latent) stage and thereby escapes eradication by current antiretroviral therapy. Latently infected T cells do not produce significant amounts of viral genomes or viral proteins due to the silencing of a specific step in the viral life cycle called transcription. Viral transcription can be reactivated in latently infected cells, a process that rekindles HIV infection after antiretroviral therapy is discontinued. A key regulator of viral transcription is the viral Tat protein. Here we identify a novel cellular enzyme that regulates HIV transcription through the modification of the Tat protein. This enzyme, LSD1, is generally known as a transcriptional suppressor. In HIV infection, however, it acts as a transcriptional activator because downregulation of LSD1 expression or inhibition of its enzymatic activity suppresses reactivation of HIV from latency. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms of HIV latency and identify a potential new strategy that may help to keep HIV dormant in latently infected cells.

"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. A subset of medulloblastoma originates from granule cell precursors (GCPs) of the developing cerebellum and demonstrates aberrant hedgehog signaling, typically due to inactivating mutations in the receptor PTCH1, a pathomechanism recapitulated in Ptch1+/− mice. As nitric oxide may regulate GCP proliferation and differentiation, we crossed Ptch1+/− mice with mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2) to investigate a possible influence on tumorigenesis. We observed a two-fold higher medulloblastoma rate in Ptch1+/− Nos2−/− mice compared to Ptch1+/− Nos2+/+ mice. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this finding, we performed gene expression profiling of medulloblastomas from both genotypes, as well as normal cerebellar tissue samples of different developmental stages and genotypes. Downregulation of hedgehog target genes was observed in postnatal cerebellum from Ptch1+/+ Nos2−/− mice but not from Ptch1+/− Nos2−/− mice. The most consistent effect of Nos2 deficiency was downregulation of growth-associated protein 43 (Gap43). Functional studies in neuronal progenitor cells demonstrated nitric oxide dependence of Gap43 expression and impaired migration upon Gap43 knock-down. Both effects were confirmed in situ by immunofluorescence analyses on tissue sections of the developing cerebellum. Finally, the number of proliferating GCPs at the cerebellar periphery was decreased in Ptch1+/+ Nos2−/− mice but increased in Ptch1+/− Nos2−/− mice relative to Ptch1+/− Nos2+/+ mice. Taken together, these results indicate that Nos2 deficiency promotes medulloblastoma development in Ptch1+/− mice through retention of proliferating GCPs in the external granular layer due to reduced Gap43 expression. This study illustrates a new role of nitric oxide signaling in cerebellar development and demonstrates that the localization of pre-neoplastic cells during morphogenesis is crucial for their malignant progression.
","Medulloblastoma is a common pediatric brain tumor, a subtype of which is driven by aberrant hedgehog pathway activation in cerebellar granule cell precursors. Although this tumor etiology has been intensively investigated in the well-established Ptch1+/− mouse model, knowledge is still lacking about the molecular interactions between neoplastic transformation and other developmental processes. Nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to be involved in controlling proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Therefore, inactivation of the NO–producing enzyme Nos2 in combination with the mutated Ptch1 gene should provide insight into how developmental regulation influences pathogenesis. Here, we describe a new role for NO in developing neuronal precursors of the cerebellum facilitating physiologically accurate migration via regulation of Gap43. We further demonstrate that disturbance of these processes leads to retention of granule precursor cells to the cerebellar periphery. Together with the sustained proliferation of these cells in combined Ptch1+/− Nos2−/− mice, this effect results in an increased medulloblastoma incidence relative to Ptch1+/− mice and demonstrates a new disease-promoting mechanism in this tumor entity.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of chronic liver disease. Several highly diverse HCV genotypes exist with potential key functional differences. The HCV NS5A protein was associated with response to interferon (IFN)-α based therapy, and is a primary target of currently developed directly-acting antiviral compounds. NS5A is important for replication and virus production, but has not been studied for most HCV genotypes. We studied the function of NS5A using infectious NS5A genotype 1–7 cell culture systems, and through reverse genetics demonstrated a universal importance of the amphipathic alpha-helix, domain I and II and the low-complexity sequence (LCS) I for HCV replication; the replicon-enhancing LCSI mutation S225P attenuated all genotypes. Mutation of conserved prolines in LCSII led to minor reductions in virus production for the JFH1(genotype 2a) NS5A recombinant, but had greater effects on other isolates; replication was highly attenuated for ED43(4a) and QC69(7a) recombinants. Deletion of the conserved residues 414-428 in domain III reduced virus production for most recombinants but not JFH1(2a). Reduced virus production was linked to attenuated replication in all cases, but ED43(4a) and SA13(5a) also displayed impaired particle assembly. Compared to the original H77C(1a) NS5A recombinant, the changes in LCSII and domain III reduced the amounts of NS5A present. For H77C(1a) and TN(1a) NS5A recombinants, we observed a genetic linkage between NS5A and p7, since introduced changes in NS5A led to changes in p7 and vice versa. Finally, NS5A function depended on genotype-specific residues in domain I, as changing genotype 2a-specific residues to genotype 1a sequence and vice versa led to highly attenuated mutants. In conclusion, this study identified NS5A genetic elements essential for all major HCV genotypes in infectious cell culture systems. Genotype- or isolate- specific NS5A functional differences were identified, which will be important for understanding of HCV NS5A function and therapeutic targeting.
","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health burden and leads to chronic liver disease, including liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Understanding the biological functions of the virus is crucial to the development of a vaccine and to improve current therapy through development of directly-acting antiviral compounds. The NS5A protein is a promising antiviral target, but much remains to be understood about its role in the viral life cycle. Great diversity among the seven major HCV genotypes poses challenges for broadly active inhibitors. Here we used infectious cell culture systems for NS5A of the seven major HCV genotypes, and demonstrated that all genotypes depended on the NS5A amphipathic alpha-helix, domain I, low-complexity sequence (LCS) I and domain II for viral replication. Interestingly, effects on replication and virus production by changes in LCSII and domain III varied greatly among NS5A isolates. Furthermore, we found that genotype 2 had evolved genotype-specific residues in domain I of importance for viral function. Thus, the highly diverse sequence of the NS5A protein reflected functional differences between HCV genotypes and isolates. Such differences will be important to consider in understanding HCV biology and for future development of antiviral compounds.

"Ankyrin repeat containing proteins are one of the most abundant solenoid folds. Usually implicated in specific protein-protein interactions, these proteins are readily amenable for design, with promising biotechnological and biomedical applications. Studying repeat protein families presents technical challenges due to the high sequence divergence among the repeating units. We developed and applied a systematic method to consistently identify and annotate the structural repetitions over the members of the complete Ankyrin Repeat Protein Family, with increased sensitivity over previous studies. We statistically characterized the number of repeats, the folding of the repeat-arrays, their structural variations, insertions and deletions. An energetic analysis of the local frustration patterns reveal the basic features underlying fold stability and its relation to the functional binding regions. We found a strong linear correlation between the conservation of the energetic features in the repeat arrays and their sequence variations, and discuss new insights into the organization and function of these ubiquitous proteins.
","Some natural proteins are formed with repetitions of similar amino acid stretches. Ankyrin-repeat proteins constitute one of the most abundant families of this class of proteins that serve as model systems to analyze how variations in sequences exert effects in structures and biological functions. We present an in-depth analysis of the ankyrin repeat protein family, characterizing the variations in the repeating arrays both at the structural and energetic level. We introduce a consistent annotation for the repeat characteristics and describe how the structural differences are related to the sequences by their underlying energetic signatures.

"While there is accumulating evidence for the importance of the metabolic cost of information in sensory systems, how these costs are traded-off with movement when sensing is closely linked to movement is poorly understood. For example, if an animal needs to search a given amount of space beyond the range of its vision system, is it better to evolve a higher acuity visual system, or evolve a body movement system that can more rapidly move the body over that space? How is this trade-off dependent upon the three-dimensional shape of the field of sensory sensitivity (hereafter, sensorium)? How is it dependent upon sensorium mobility, either through rotation of the sensorium via muscles at the base of the sense organ (e.g., eye or pinna muscles) or neck rotation, or by whole body movement through space? Here we show that in an aquatic model system, the electric fish, a choice to swim in a more inefficient manner during prey search results in a higher prey encounter rate due to better sensory performance. The increase in prey encounter rate more than counterbalances the additional energy expended in swimming inefficiently. The reduction of swimming efficiency for improved sensing arises because positioning the sensory receptor surface to scan more space per unit time results in an increase in the area of the body pushing through the fluid, increasing wasteful body drag forces. We show that the improvement in sensory performance that occurs with the costly repositioning of the body depends upon having an elongated sensorium shape. Finally, we show that if the fish was able to reorient their sensorium independent of body movement, as fish with movable eyes can, there would be significant energy savings. This provides insight into the ubiquity of sensory organ mobility in animal design. This study exposes important links between the morphology of the sensorium, sensorium mobility, and behavioral strategy for maximally extracting energy from the environment. An “infomechanical” approach to complex behavior helps to elucidate how animals distribute functions across sensory systems and movement systems with their diverse energy loads.
","Animals thrive by sensing their environment and using the information they've gathered to guide their movement. But collecting better information can result in less efficient movement: Bicycling while standing up on the pedals may help you see over obstacles ahead of you, but it causes more air drag, forcing your legs to work harder. Nocturnal weakly electric fish search for prey with their body tilted. This tilting more than doubles the resistance to movement from the water, but because the fish's ability to sense prey improves when tilted, it is better to swim this way. Beyond a certain amount of tilt, the costs of movement become too great. Interestingly, the benefit of tilting is dependent on the shape of the volume around the fish where it detects prey. We also found that if the fish was able to swivel its region of prey sensitivity, like a vision-based animal can shift its gaze, it would save energy. This conclusion helps us understand why animals like us can move our eyes. A Polish folk saying succinctly captures the gist: “He who doesn't have it in the head has it in the legs” (Ten kto nie ma w głowie ma w nogach).

"Carrion' disease, caused by Bartonella bacilliformis, remains truly neglected due to its focal geographical nature. A wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic bacteremia, and lack of a sensitive diagnostic test can potentially lead to a spread of the disease into non-endemic regions where competent sand fly vectors may be present. A reliable test capable of detecting B. bacilliformis is urgently needed. Our objective is to develop a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting the pap31 gene to detect B. bacilliformis.
The sensitivity of the LAMP was evaluated in comparison to qPCR using plasmid DNA containing the target gene and genomic DNA in the absence and presence of human or sand fly DNA. The detection limit of LAMP was 1 to 10 copies/µL, depending on the sample metrics. No cross-reaction was observed when testing against a panel of various closely related bacteria. The utility of the LAMP was further compared to qPCR by the examination of 74 Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies artificially fed on blood spiked with B. bacilliformis and harvested at days (D) 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 post feeding. Only 86% of sand flies at D1 and 63% of flies at D3 were positive by qPCR. LAMP was able to detect B. bacilliformis in all those flies confirmed positive by qPCR. However, none of the flies after D3 were positive by either LAMP or qPCR. In addition to demonstrating the sensitivity of the LAMP assay, these results suggest that B. bacilliformis cannot propagate in artificially fed L. longipalpis.
The LAMP assay is as sensitive as qPCR for the detection of B. bacilliformis and could be useful to support diagnosis of patients in low-resource settings and also to identify B. bacilliformis in the sand fly vector.
","Carrion's disease, caused by Bartonella bacilliformis remains truly neglected due to its focal geographical nature. A wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic bacteremia can potentially lead to a spread of the disease into non-endemic regions. The PCR-based approach is sensitive for detection of B. bacilliformis but requires a thermocycler, thus limiting its use in remote endemic areas. LAMP is a simple method capable of detecting B. bacilliformis DNA within an hour under isothermal conditions, requiring less specialized equipment for amplification, thus enabling diagnosis in rural areas. This study demonstrated that the detection limit of LAMP, targeting the pap31 gene of B. bacilliformis, was comparable to that of qPCR. With a high, targeted selectivity, LAMP showed a high specificity as no cross-reaction was observed when testing a panel of closely related bacteria. The utility of the LAMP assay was further demonstrated by the examination of sand flies artificially fed on blood spiked with B. bacilliformis.

"Heme-iron recycling from senescent red blood cells (erythrophagocytosis) accounts for the majority of total body iron in humans. Studies in cultured cells have ascribed a role for HRG1/SLC48A1 in heme-iron transport but the in vivo function of this heme transporter is unclear. Here we present genetic evidence in a zebrafish model that Hrg1 is essential for macrophage-mediated heme-iron recycling during erythrophagocytosis in the kidney. Furthermore, we show that zebrafish Hrg1a and its paralog Hrg1b are functional heme transporters, and genetic ablation of both transporters in double knockout (DKO) animals shows lower iron accumulation concomitant with higher amounts of heme sequestered in kidney macrophages. RNA-seq analyses of DKO kidney revealed large-scale perturbation in genes related to heme, iron metabolism and immune functions. Taken together, our results establish the kidney as the major organ for erythrophagocytosis and identify Hrg1 as an important regulator of heme-iron recycling by macrophages in the adult zebrafish.
","Total body iron stores in mammals is a composite of iron absorption from diet and iron recycled by macrophages from dying red blood cells (RBCs). Upon erythrophagocytosis of RBCs, the hemoglobin is degraded and heme is imported from the phagosomal compartment into the cytoplasm so that the iron can be released from heme. Defects in these pathways can lead to aberrant iron homeostasis. The Heme Responsive Gene-1 (HRG1, SLC48A1) was identified previously as a heme importer in the intestine of the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. In cell culture studies, HRG1 was demonstrated to mobilize heme from the erythrophagosome of mouse macrophages into the cytosol. However, the in vivo function of HRG1 remains to be elucidated. The zebrafish is a powerful genetic animal model for studying vertebrate development and ontogeny of hematopoiesis. In zebrafish, the kidney marrow is the adult hematopoietic organ that is functionally analogous to the mammalian bone marrow. In this study, we show that Hrg1 plays an essential in vivo role in recycling of damaged RBCs, and that the kidney macrophages are primarily responsible for recycling heme-iron in the adult zebrafish.

"Heterochromatin at the pericentromeric repeats in fission yeast is assembled and spread by an RNAi-dependent mechanism, which is coupled with the transcription of non-coding RNA from the repeats by RNA polymerase II. In addition, Rrp6, a component of the nuclear exosome, also contributes to heterochromatin assembly and is coupled with non-coding RNA transcription. The multi-subunit complex Mediator, which directs initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, has recently been suggested to function after initiation in processes such as elongation of transcription and splicing. However, the role of Mediator in the regulation of chromatin structure is not well understood. We investigated the role of Mediator in pericentromeric heterochromatin formation and found that deletion of specific subunits of the head domain of Mediator compromised heterochromatin structure. The Mediator head domain was required for Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin nucleation at the pericentromere and for RNAi-dependent spreading of heterochromatin into the neighboring region. In the latter process, Mediator appeared to contribute to efficient processing of siRNA from transcribed non-coding RNA, which was required for efficient spreading of heterochromatin. Furthermore, the head domain directed efficient transcription in heterochromatin. These results reveal a pivotal role for Mediator in multiple steps of transcription-coupled formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin. This observation further extends the role of Mediator to co-transcriptional chromatin regulation.
","DNA is packaged into chromatin structure, which is important for various genome functions such as gene expression and maintenance of genetic information. Heterochromatin is a condensed chromatin structure and involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression through repression of transcription. Heterochromatin at the pericentromeric repeats in fission yeast is assembled by two distinct mechanisms, RNAi-dependent and Rrp6, a component of the nuclear exosome, -dependent mechanisms. In addition, heterochromatin spreads into neighboring regions in an RNAi-dependent manner. Both mechanisms are coupled with the transcription from the target loci by RNA polymerase II, but the molecular nature of the coupling is not understood. Here we showed that the multi-subunit complex Mediator, which directs initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, functions in the coupling between transcription and heterochromatin assembly. Mediator is required for Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin assembly and contributes to the RNAi-dependent spreading of heterochromatin via enhancement of production of siRNA by RNAi machinery. These observations highlight the multi-functions of Mediator in the transcription-coupled processes.

"Placental malaria (PM) can lead to poor neonatal outcomes, including low birthweight due to fetal growth restriction (FGR), especially when associated with local inflammation (intervillositis or IV). The pathogenesis of PM-associated FGR is largely unknown, but in idiopathic FGR, impaired transplacental amino acid transport, especially through the system A group of amino acid transporters, has been implicated. We hypothesized that PM-associated FGR could result from impairment of transplacental amino acid transport triggered by IV. In a cohort of Malawian women and their infants, the expression and activity of system A (measured by Na+-dependent 14C-MeAIB uptake) were reduced in PM, especially when associated with IV, compared to uninfected placentas. In an in vitro model of PM with IV, placental cells exposed to monocyte/infected erythrocytes conditioned medium showed decreased system A activity. Amino acid concentrations analyzed by reversed phase ultra performance liquid chromatography in paired maternal and cord plasmas revealed specific alterations of amino acid transport by PM, especially with IV. Overall, our data suggest that the fetoplacental unit responds to PM by altering its placental amino acid transport to maintain adequate fetal growth. However, IV more profoundly compromises placental amino acid transport function, leading to FGR. Our study offers the first pathogenetic explanation for FGR in PM.
","Malaria infection during pregnancy can cause fetal growth restriction and low birthweight associated with high infant mortality and morbidity rates. The pathogenesis of fetal growth restriction in placental malaria is largely unknown, but in other pathological pregnancies, impaired transplacental amino acid transport has been implicated. In a cohort of Malawian women and their infants, we found that placental malaria, especially when associated with local inflammation, was associated with decreased expression and activity of an important group of amino acid placental transporters. Using an in vitro model of placental malaria with local inflammation, we discovered that maternal monocyte products could impair the activity of amino acid transporters on placental cells. Amino acid concentrations in paired maternal and cord plasmas revealed specific alterations of amino acid transport by placental malaria, especially with local inflammation. Overall, our data suggest that, more than malaria infection per se, the local inflammation it triggers compromises placental amino acid transport function, leading to fetal growth restriction. Greater understanding of the mechanisms involved, combined with interventions to improve fetal growth in malaria, are important priorities in areas of the world where the co-existence of malaria and maternal malnutrition threatens the health and lives of millions of young babies.

"Sex determination in mammals is controlled by the presence or absence of the Y-linked gene SRY. In the developing male (XY) gonad, sex-determining region of the Y (SRY) protein acts to up-regulate expression of the related gene, SOX9, a transcriptional regulator that in turn initiates a downstream pathway of testis development, whilst also suppressing ovary development. Despite the requirement for a number of transcription factors and secreted signalling molecules in sex determination, intracellular signalling components functioning in this process have not been defined. Here we report a role for the phylogenetically ancient mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in mouse sex determination. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified the recessive boygirl (byg) mutation. On the C57BL/6J background, embryos homozygous for byg exhibit consistent XY gonadal sex reversal. The byg mutation is an A to T transversion causing a premature stop codon in the gene encoding MAP3K4 (also known as MEKK4), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase. Analysis of XY byg/byg gonads at 11.5 d post coitum reveals a growth deficit and a failure to support mesonephric cell migration, both early cellular processes normally associated with testis development. Expression analysis of mutant XY gonads at the same stage also reveals a dramatic reduction in Sox9 and, crucially, Sry at the transcript and protein levels. Moreover, we describe experiments showing the presence of activated MKK4, a direct target of MAP3K4, and activated p38 in the coelomic region of the XY gonad at 11.5 d post coitum, establishing a link between MAPK signalling in proliferating gonadal somatic cells and regulation of Sry expression. Finally, we provide evidence that haploinsufficiency for Map3k4 accounts for T-associated sex reversal (Tas). These data demonstrate that MAP3K4-dependent signalling events are required for normal expression of Sry during testis development, and create a novel entry point into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sex determination in mice and disorders of sexual development in humans.
","In mammals, whether an individual develops as a male or female depends on its sex chromosome constitution: those with a Y chromosome become males because of the development of the embryonic gonad into a testis. The Y-linked sex determining gene SRY regulates this process by initiating a pathway of gene and protein expression, including the expression of critical autosomal genes such as SOX9. We identified a mouse mutant that causes embryonic gonadal sex reversal: the development of ovaries in an XY embryo. This mutant, which we called boygirl (byg), was shown to contain an early stop codon that disrupts the autosomal gene encoding MAP3K4, a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Analysis of embryonic XY gonads suggests that sex reversal is caused by delayed and reduced expression of the sex-determining gene SRY. Our data indicate, for the first time, a requirement for MAPK signaling in the developing XY gonad in order to facilitate normal expression of SRY and the downstream testis-determining genes and also suggest that reduced dosage of MAP3K4 may be the cause of a previously described autosomal sex-reversing mutation in the mouse. We predict that loss of MAP3K4 or other MAPK components may underlie disorders of sexual development (DSD) in humans as well.

"Metachondromatosis (MC) is a rare, autosomal dominant, incompletely penetrant combined exostosis and enchondromatosis tumor syndrome. MC is clinically distinct from other multiple exostosis or multiple enchondromatosis syndromes and is unlinked to EXT1 and EXT2, the genes responsible for autosomal dominant multiple osteochondromas (MO). To identify a gene for MC, we performed linkage analysis with high-density SNP arrays in a single family, used a targeted array to capture exons and promoter sequences from the linked interval in 16 participants from 11 MC families, and sequenced the captured DNA using high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies. DNA capture and parallel sequencing identified heterozygous putative loss-of-function mutations in PTPN11 in 4 of the 11 families. Sanger sequence analysis of PTPN11 coding regions in a total of 17 MC families identified mutations in 10 of them (5 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 splice-site mutations). Copy number analysis of sequencing reads from a second targeted capture that included the entire PTPN11 gene identified an additional family with a 15 kb deletion spanning exon 7 of PTPN11. Microdissected MC lesions from two patients with PTPN11 mutations demonstrated loss-of-heterozygosity for the wild-type allele. We next sequenced PTPN11 in DNA samples from 54 patients with the multiple enchondromatosis disorders Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome, but found no coding sequence PTPN11 mutations. We conclude that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PTPN11 are a frequent cause of MC, that lesions in patients with MC appear to arise following a “second hit,” that MC may be locus heterogeneous since 1 familial and 5 sporadically occurring cases lacked obvious disease-causing PTPN11 mutations, and that PTPN11 mutations are not a common cause of Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome.
","Children with cartilage tumor syndromes form multiple tumors of cartilage next to joints. These tumors can occur inside the bones, as with Ollier disease and Maffuci syndrome, or on the surface of bones, as in the Multiple Osteochondroma syndrome (MO). In a hybrid syndrome, called metachondromatosis (MC), patients develop tumors both on and within bones. Only the genes causing MO are known. Since MC is inherited, we studied genetic markers in an affected family and found a region of the genome, encompassing 100 genes, always passed on to affected members. Using a recently developed method, we captured and sequenced all 100 genes in multiple families and found mutations in one gene, PTPN11, in 11 of 17 families. Patients with MC have one mutant copy of PTPN11 from their affected parent and one normal copy from their unaffected parent in all cells. We found that the normal copy is additionally lost in cartilage cells that form tumors, giving rise to cells without PTPN11. Mutations in PTPN11 were not found in other cartilage tumor syndromes, including Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome. We are currently working to understand how loss of PTPN11 in cartilage cells causes tumors to form.

"Hepatitis A virus (HAV), the prototype of genus Hepatovirus, has several unique biological characteristics that distinguish it from other members of the Picornaviridae family. Among these, the need for an intact eIF4G factor for the initiation of translation results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis by a mechanism similar to that of other picornaviruses. Consequently, HAV must inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery and this may explain its poor growth in cell culture. In this context of virus/cell competition, HAV has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host. With the aim to optimize its codon usage the virus was adapted to propagate in cells with impaired protein synthesis, in order to make tRNA pools more available for the virus. A significant loss of fitness was the immediate response to the adaptation process that was, however, later on recovered and more associated to a re-deoptimization rather than to an optimization of the codon usage specifically in the capsid coding region. These results exclude translation selection and instead suggest fine-tuning translation kinetics selection as the underlying mechanism of the codon usage bias in this specific genome region. Additionally, the results provide clear evidence of the Red Queen dynamics of evolution since the virus has very much evolved to re-adapt its codon usage to the environmental cellular changing conditions in order to recover the original fitness.
","Each organism has a specific codon usage signature. Translational selection i.e., selection for the codon adaptation to the tRNA pools, is one of the driving forces of codon bias. In the virus world, this implies an adjustment of the virus codon usage to that of the host cell. Hepatitis A virus appears as an exception to the rule, with a highly deoptimized codon usage, suggesting that translational selection is not the underlying mechanism of its codon bias. However, since the virus lacks a mechanism of cellular protein synthesis inhibition, the deoptimized codon usage may be envisaged as a hawk (cell) and dove (hepatitis A virus) competition strategy for tRNAs and translational selection as well. To confirm this possibility, we artificially induced cell protein synthesis shut-off, thus increasing the tRNA pool availability for the virus, and we took advantage of the quasispecies dynamics to elucidate changes in its codon usage. Virus adaptation to the drug results in a re-deoptimization of codon usage in the capsid region, suggesting a requirement of a slow translation rate, i.e., a translation kinetic selection, instead of a translational selection associated with an optimization of the codon usage. Translation kinetics control is based on the right combination of codons (common and rare) that allows a regulated ribosome traffic rate ensuring the proper protein folding. Capsid folding is critical for a virus transmitted through the fecal-oral route with long extracorporeal periods.

"Antagonistic interactions are likely important driving forces of the evolutionary process underlying bacterial genome complexity and diversity. We hypothesized that the ability of evolved bacteria to escape specific components of host innate immunity, such as phagocytosis and killing by macrophages (MΦ), is a critical trait relevant in the acquisition of bacterial virulence. Here, we used a combination of experimental evolution, phenotypic characterization, genome sequencing and mathematical modeling to address how fast, and through how many adaptive steps, a commensal Escherichia coli (E. coli) acquire this virulence trait. We show that when maintained in vitro under the selective pressure of host MΦ commensal E. coli can evolve, in less than 500 generations, virulent clones that escape phagocytosis and MΦ killing in vitro, while increasing their pathogenicity in vivo, as assessed in mice. This pathoadaptive process is driven by a mechanism involving the insertion of a single transposable element into the promoter region of the E. coli yrfF gene. Moreover, transposition of the IS186 element into the promoter of Lon gene, encoding an ATP-dependent serine protease, is likely to accelerate this pathoadaptive process. Competition between clones carrying distinct beneficial mutations dominates the dynamics of the pathoadaptive process, as suggested from a mathematical model, which reproduces the observed experimental dynamics of E. coli evolution towards virulence. In conclusion, we reveal a molecular mechanism explaining how a specific component of host innate immunity can modulate microbial evolution towards pathogenicity.
","The selective pressure imposed by the host immune system is an important component of microbial adaptation from commensalism to pathogenicity. We used experimental evolution to study the initial steps of the adaptation of Escherichia coli to cells of the innate immune system, i.e., macrophages. Our results demonstrate that bacteria can evolve remarkably fast, and acquire adaptations increasing survival inside macrophages and/or ability to escape engulfment. The mechanism underlying this pathoadaptive process involves the accumulation of mutations caused by transposon insertions, increasing pathogenicity in vivo. These findings reveal the remarkable fast pace at which bacteria can evolve to escape a central component of the host innate immunity, namely macrophages.

"The Bolivian northern Altiplano is characterized by a high prevalence of Fasciola hepatica infection. In order to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of large-scale administration of triclabendazole as an appropriate public health measure to control morbidity associated with fascioliasis, a pilot intervention was implemented in 2008.
Schoolchildren from an endemic community were screened for fascioliasis and treated with a single administration of triclabendazole (10 mg/kg). Interviews to assess the occurrence of adverse events were conducted on treatment day, one week later, and one month after treatment. Further parasitological screenings were performed three months after treatment and again two months later (following a further treatment) in order to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention.
Ninety infected children were administered triclabendazole. Adverse events were infrequent and mild. No serious adverse events were reported. Observed cure rates were 77.8% after one treatment and 97.8% after two treatments, while egg reduction rates ranged between 74% and 90.3% after one treatment, and between 84.2% and 99.9% after two treatments. The proportion of high-intensity infections (≥400 epg) decreased from 7.8% to 1.1% after one treatment and to 0% after two treatments.
Administration of triclabendazole is a feasible, safe and efficacious public health intervention in an endemic community in the Bolivian Altiplano, suggesting that preventive chemotherapy can be applied to control of fascioliasis. Further investigations are needed to define the most appropriate frequency of treatment.
","Fascioliasis is highly prevalent in the northern Altiplano of Bolivia. We wanted to ascertain whether a preventive chemotherapy approach, involving the large-scale distribution of triclabendazole within endemic communities, would be feasible for controlling morbidity associated with this disease. Consequently, we implemented a pilot intervention among schoolchildren in a community near Lake Titicaca and assessed this intervention's safety (by evaluating the occurrence of adverse events following treatment) and its efficacy (by measuring changes in prevalence and intensity of infection). Adverse events on treatment day, and one week and one month later were infrequent and mild, and no serious adverse events were reported. We observed cure rates of 77.8% after one treatment and 97.8% after two treatments, egg reduction rates of 74–90.3% after one treatment and 84.2–99.9% after two treatments, and a decrease in the proportion of high-intensity infections (≥400 epg) from 7.8% to 1.1% after one treatment and to 0% after two treatments. We conclude that administration of triclabendazole is a safe and efficacious public health intervention for control of fascioliasis in an endemic community in the Bolivian Altiplano. Preventive chemotherapy with triclabendazole, without individual-level diagnosis and treatment, appears therefore as a feasible option. However, further investigation is needed to define the most appropriate frequency of treatment.

"The dissacharide trehalose is an important intracellular osmoprotectant and the OtsA/B pathway is the principal pathway for trehalose biosynthesis in a wide range of bacterial species. Scaffolding proteins and other cytoskeletal elements play an essential role in morphogenetic processes in bacteria. Here we describe how OtsA, in addition to its role in trehalose biosynthesis, functions as an osmotic stress sensor to regulate cell morphology in Arthrobacter strain A3. In response to osmotic stress, this and other Arthrobacter species undergo a transition from bacillary to myceloid growth. An otsA null mutant exhibits constitutive myceloid growth. Osmotic stress leads to a depletion of trehalose-6-phosphate, the product of the OtsA enzyme, and experimental depletion of this metabolite also leads to constitutive myceloid growth independent of OtsA function. In vitro analyses indicate that OtsA can self-assemble into protein networks, promoted by trehalose-6-phosphate, a property that is not shared by the equivalent enzyme from E. coli, despite the latter’s enzymatic activity when expressed in Arthrobacter. This, and the localization of the protein in non-stressed cells at the mid-cell and poles, indicates that OtsA from Arthrobacter likely functions as a cytoskeletal element regulating cell morphology. Recruiting a biosynthetic enzyme for this morphogenetic function represents an intriguing adaptation in bacteria that can survive in extreme environments.
","For free living bacteria, little is known about how environmental cues are perceived and translated into changes in cell morphology. Here we describe how a biosynthetic enzyme involved in synthesis of an important intracellular osmoprotectant doubles as an osmotic stress sensing morphogenetic protein. This protein is involved in an adaptive response involving a growth transition in stress-tolerant bacteria, from growing as individual cells to forming non-separating branched cell aggregates. We demonstrate that the protein can self-assemble into large networks, consistent with its role as a morphogenetic protein, this assembly process being promoted by a metabolic product of the enzyme. Depletion of either this metabolite or the morphogenetic protein results in the inability of the bacteria to grow as individual cells in conditions of low osmolarity.

"Two central biophysical laws describe sensory responses to input signals. One is a logarithmic relationship between input and output, and the other is a power law relationship. These laws are sometimes called the Weber-Fechner law and the Stevens power law, respectively. The two laws are found in a wide variety of human sensory systems including hearing, vision, taste, and weight perception; they also occur in the responses of cells to stimuli. However the mechanistic origin of these laws is not fully understood. To address this, we consider a class of biological circuits exhibiting a property called fold-change detection (FCD). In these circuits the response dynamics depend only on the relative change in input signal and not its absolute level, a property which applies to many physiological and cellular sensory systems. We show analytically that by changing a single parameter in the FCD circuits, both logarithmic and power-law relationships emerge; these laws are modified versions of the Weber-Fechner and Stevens laws. The parameter that determines which law is found is the steepness (effective Hill coefficient) of the effect of the internal variable on the output. This finding applies to major circuit architectures found in biological systems, including the incoherent feed-forward loop and nonlinear integral feedback loops. Therefore, if one measures the response to different fold changes in input signal and observes a logarithmic or power law, the present theory can be used to rule out certain FCD mechanisms, and to predict their cooperativity parameter. We demonstrate this approach using data from eukaryotic chemotaxis signaling.
","One of the first measurements an experimentalist makes to understand a sensory system is to explore the relation between input signal and the systems response amplitude. Here, we show using mathematical models that this measurement can give important clues about the possible mechanism of sensing. We use models that incorporate the nearly-universal features of sensory systems, including hearing and vision, and the sensing pathways of individual cells. These nearly-universal features include exact adaptation-the ability to ignore prolonged input stimuli and return to basal activity, and fold-change detection- response to relative changes in input, not absolute changes. Together with information on the input-output relationship-e.g. is it a logarithmic or a power law relationship-we show that these conditions provide enough constraints to allow the researcher to reject certain circuit designs; it also predicts, if one assumes a given design, one of its key parameters. This study can thus help unify our understanding of sensory systems, and help pinpoint the possible biological circuits based on physiological measurements.

"Accumulation of genome rearrangements is a characteristic of aged tissues. Since genome rearrangements result from faulty repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), we hypothesized that DNA DSB repair becomes less efficient with age. The Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway repairs a majority of DSBs in vertebrates. To examine age-associated changes in NHEJ, we have generated an R26NHEJ mouse model in which a GFP-based NHEJ reporter cassette is knocked-in to the ROSA26 locus. In this model, NHEJ repair of DSBs generated by the site-specific endonuclease, I-SceI, reconstitutes a functional GFP gene. In this system NHEJ efficiency can be compared across tissues of the same mouse and in mice of different age. Using R26NHEJ mice, we found that NHEJ efficiency was higher in the skin, lung, and kidney fibroblasts, and lower in the heart fibroblasts and brain astrocytes. Furthermore, we observed that NHEJ efficiency declined with age. In the 24-month old animals compared to the 5-month old animals, NHEJ efficiency declined 1.8 to 3.8-fold, depending on the tissue, with the strongest decline observed in the skin fibroblasts. The sequence analysis of 300 independent NHEJ repair events showed that, regardless of age, mice utilize microhomology sequences at a significantly higher frequency than expected by chance. Furthermore, the frequency of microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) events increased in the heart and lung fibroblasts of old mice, suggesting that NHEJ becomes more mutagenic with age. In summary, our study provides a versatile mouse model for the analysis of NHEJ in a wide range of tissues and demonstrates that DNA repair by NHEJ declines with age in mice, which could provide a mechanism for age-related genomic instability and increased cancer incidence with age.
","DNA damage disrupting both DNA strands, termed double strand breaks (DSBs), poses a threat to cell survival. If repaired inappropriately, such DNA breaks lead to genomic rearrangements, mutations, and ultimately cancer. Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is the major pathway for repairing double-stranded breaks in mammals. Errors associated with NHEJ have been implicated in the aging process because mice with mutations in NHEJ genes exhibit premature aging. It remains unknown, however, whether NHEJ becomes impaired during normal aging. Studies of age-related changes in NHEJ have been hampered by the lack of a mouse model that would allow detection and quantification of NHEJ events. Here we report generation of NHEJ reporter mice containing a GFP-based NHEJ cassette knocked-into the ROSA26 locus. Using this mouse model, we were able to compare NHEJ across different tissues and demonstrate that NHEJ becomes less efficient and more error-prone with age. Our results provide a mechanism for age-related genomic instability and increased cancer incidence with age. The NHEJ reporter mice will be useful for a broad range of studies in the fields of aging and DNA repair.

"Visceral Leishmaniasis is a deadly disease caused by Leishmania infantum, endemic in more than 98 countries across the globe. Although the most common means of transmission is via a sand fly vector, there is growing evidence that vertical transmission may be critical for maintaining L. infantum infection within the reservoir, canine, population. Vertical transmission is also an important cause of infant morbidity and mortality particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. While vertical transmission of visceralizing species of Leishmania has been reported around the globe, risk factors associated with this unique means of Leishmania transmission have not been identified therefore interventions regarding this means of transmission have been virtually non-existent. Furthermore, the basic reproductive number, (R0), or number of new L. infantum infections that one infected mother or dam can cause has not been established for vertical transmission, also hampering the ability to assess the impact of this means of transmission within reservoir of human hosts. Canine Leishmaniosis (CanL) is enzootic within a U.S. hunting dog population. CanL is transmitted within this population via transplacental transmission with no reported vector transmission, despite many repeated attempts to find infected sand flies associated with these dogs and kennels. This population with predominantly, if not solely, vertical transmission of L. infantum was used to evaluate the critical risk factors for vertical transmission of Leishmania and establish the R0 of vertical L. infantum infection. Evaluation of 124 animals born to eighteen dams diagnostically positive for infection with L. infantum showed that there was a 13.84x greater chance of being positive for L. infantum within their lifetime if the mother was also positive within her lifetime (RR: 13.84, 95% CI: 3.54–54.20, p-value: <0.0001). The basic reproductive number for vertically transmitted L. infantum within this cohort was 4.12. These results underscore that there is a high risk of L. infantum infection to transmit from mother to offspring. Targeted public health interventions and control efforts that address vertical transmission of L. infantum are necessary in endemic countries to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis.
","Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a deadly disease caused by Leishmania infantum parasite, it is found in animal populations, including people, in more than 98 countries across the globe. CanL was first identified within the US in hunting dogs 1980 and then again in 1999 when a large outbreak in a kennel in New York occurred. As the US is usually not considered a tropical country, there was much debate about how this neglected, vector borne, tropical disease had made its way into these dogs. We found that within the U.S. hunting dog population CanL is transmitted from mom to pup with no reported sand fly transmission in the population, despite multiple attempts to find infected sand flies associated with these dogs. While vertical transmission of this disease has been reported in case reports around the globe, risk factors associated with this unique means of Leishmania transmission are not known. Furthermore, the basic reproductive number, (R0), or number of new infections that one infected animal can cause has not been reported for vertical transmission of L. infantum. It is important to know the R0 as it helps identify how infectious a route of transmission can be and therefore how easy it might be to control this infection. A cohort of 124 dogs from 18 dams was analyzed from 1999 to 2016 for factors related to vertical transmission. Offspring from dams ever diagnostically positive for infection with L. infantum were 13.84x more likely to become positive for L. infantum themselves within their lifetime (RR: 13.84 95% CI: 3.54–54.20 p-value: <0.0001). The basic reproductive number for vertically transmitted L. infantum within this cohort was 4.12. These results underscore that an infected mom is highly likely to infect her offspring if treatment is not started to prevent transmission. There is a need for any public health prevention and control efforts to address vertical as well as vector transmission of canine leishmaniosis in endemic countries.

"Filamentous fungus Penicillium oxalicum produces diverse lignocellulolytic enzymes, which are regulated by the combinations of many transcription factors. Here, a single-gene disruptant library for 470 transcription factors was constructed and systematically screened for cellulase production. Twenty transcription factors (including ClrB, CreA, XlnR, Ace1, AmyR, and 15 unknown proteins) were identified to play putative roles in the activation or repression of cellulase synthesis. Most of these regulators have not been characterized in any fungi before. We identified the ClrB, CreA, XlnR, and AmyR transcription factors as critical dose-dependent regulators of cellulase expression, the core regulons of which were identified by analyzing several transcriptomes and/or secretomes. Synergistic and additive modes of combinatorial control of each cellulase gene by these regulatory factors were achieved, and cellulase expression was fine-tuned in a proper and controlled manner. With one of these targets, the expression of the major intracellular β-glucosidase Bgl2 was found to be dependent on ClrB. The Bgl2-deficient background resulted in a substantial gene activation by ClrB and proved to be closely correlated with the relief of repression mediated by CreA and AmyR during cellulase induction. Our results also signify that probing the synergistic and dose-controlled regulation mechanisms of cellulolytic regulators and using it for reconstruction of expression regulation network (RERN) may be a promising strategy for cellulolytic fungi to develop enzyme hyper-producers. Based on our data, ClrB was identified as focal point for the synergistic activation regulation of cellulase expression by integrating cellulolytic regulators and their target genes, which refined our understanding of transcriptional-regulatory network as a “seesaw model” in which the coordinated regulation of cellulolytic genes is established by counteracting activators and repressors.
","Cellulolytic fungi have evolved into sophisticated lignocellulolytic systems to adapt to their natural habitat. This trait is important for filamentous fungi, which are the main source of cellulases utilized to degrade lignocellulose to fermentable sugars. Penicillium oxalicum, which produces lignocellulolytic enzymes with more diverse components than Trichoderma reesei, has the capacity to secrete large amounts of cellulases. Meanwhile, cellulase expression is regulated by a complex network involved in many transcription factors in this organism. To better understand how cellulase genes are systematically regulated in P. oxalicum, we employed molecular genetics to uncover the cellulolytic transcription factors on a genome-wide scale. We discovered the synergistic and tunable regulation of cellulase expression by integrating cellulolytic regulators and their target genes, which refined our understanding of transcriptional-regulatory network as a “seesaw model” in which the coordinated regulation of cellulolytic genes is established by counteracting activators and repressors.

"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an enigmatic endothelial cell vascular neoplasm, is characterized by the proliferation of spindle shaped endothelial cells, inflammatory cytokines (ICs), growth factors (GFs) and angiogenic factors. KSHV is etiologically linked to KS and expresses its latent genes in KS lesion endothelial cells. Primary infection of human micro vascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d) results in the establishment of latent infection and reprogramming of host genes, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is one of the highly up-regulated genes. Our previous study suggested a role for COX-2 in the establishment and maintenance of KSHV latency. Here, we examined the role of COX-2 in the induction of ICs, GFs, angiogenesis and invasive events occurring during KSHV de novo infection of endothelial cells. A significant amount of COX-2 was detected in KS tissue sections. Telomerase-immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells supporting KSHV stable latency (TIVE-LTC) expressed elevated levels of functional COX-2 and microsomal PGE2 synthase (m-PGES), and secreted the predominant eicosanoid inflammatory metabolite PGE2. Infected HMVEC-d and TIVE-LTC cells secreted a variety of ICs, GFs, angiogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which were significantly abrogated by COX-2 inhibition either by chemical inhibitors or by siRNA. The ability of these factors to induce tube formation of uninfected endothelial cells was also inhibited. PGE2, secreted early during KSHV infection, profoundly increased the adhesion of uninfected endothelial cells to fibronectin by activating the small G protein Rac1. COX-2 inhibition considerably reduced KSHV latent ORF73 gene expression and survival of TIVE-LTC cells. Collectively, these studies underscore the pivotal role of KSHV induced COX-2/PGE2 in creating KS lesion like microenvironment during de novo infection. Since COX-2 plays multiple roles in KSHV latent gene expression, which themselves are powerful mediators of cytokine induction, anti-apoptosis, cell survival and viral genome maintainence, effective inhibition of COX-2 via well-characterized clinically approved COX-2 inhibitors could potentially be used in treatment to control latent KSHV infection and ameliorate KS.
","Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus (KSHV), with a 160 kb DNA genome, has evolved with two distinct life cycle phases, namely latency and lytic replication. KS, a complex angioproliferative disease, is regulated by a balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. In our previous study, we showed that KSHV modulates host factors COX-2/PGE2 for its own advantage to promote its latent (persistent) infection. The premise that COX-2 is involved in growth and progression of several types of solid cancers and inflammation associated diseases has been well documented but has never been studied in KS. Here, utilizing COX-2 inhibition strategies, including chemical inhibition and a gene silencing approach, we systematically identified the potential role of KSHV induced COX-2/PGE2 in viral pathogenesis related events such as secretion of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines, MMPs and cell adhesion in de novo infected or latently infected endothelial cells. We report that COX-2/PGE2 inhibition down-regulates viral latent gene expression and survival of latently infected endothelial cells. The data emanating from our in vitro studies is valuable, informative and requires further examination using an in vitro angiogenic model and in vivo nude mice model to further validate COX-2 as a novel therapeutic to target latent infection and the associated diseases like KS.

"Most studies in the life sciences and other disciplines involve generating and analyzing numerical data of some type as the foundation for scientific findings. Working with numerical data involves multiple challenges. These include reproducible data acquisition, appropriate data storage, computationally correct data analysis, appropriate reporting and presentation of the results, and suitable data interpretation.
Finding and correcting mistakes when analyzing and interpreting data can be frustrating and time-consuming. Presenting or publishing incorrect results is embarrassing but not uncommon. Particular sources of errors are inappropriate use of statistical methods and incorrect interpretation of data by software. To detect mistakes as early as possible, one should frequently check intermediate and final results for plausibility. Clearly documenting how quantities and results were obtained facilitates correcting mistakes. Properly understanding data is indispensable for reaching well-founded conclusions from experimental results. Units are needed to make sense of numbers, and uncertainty should be estimated to know how meaningful results are. Descriptive statistics and significance testing are useful tools for interpreting numerical results if applied correctly. However, blindly trusting in computed numbers can also be misleading, so it is worth thinking about how data should be summarized quantitatively to properly answer the question at hand. Finally, a suitable form of presentation is needed so that the data can properly support the interpretation and findings. By additionally sharing the relevant data, others can access, understand, and ultimately make use of the results.
These quick tips are intended to provide guidelines for correctly interpreting, efficiently analyzing, and presenting numerical data in a useful way.
","Data expressed as numbers are ubiquitous in research in the life sciences and other fields. The typical scientific workflow using such numerical data consists of analyzing the raw data to obtain numerical results, followed by interpreting the results and presenting derived findings.

To facilitate correct interpretation of data, we suggest paying attention to correct units of values and to understandable formulas. Appropriate statistical methods should be used for the specific question at hand.

"The devastating clinical consequences associated with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and reactivation underscores the importance of understanding triggers of HCMV reactivation in dendritic cells (DC). Here we show that ERK-mediated reactivation is dependent on the mitogen and stress activated kinase (MSK) family. Furthermore, this MSK mediated response is dependent on CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). Specifically, CREB binding to the MIEP provides the target for MSK recruitment. Importantly, MSK mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. Taken together, these data suggest that CREB binding to the MIEP is necessary for the recruitment of the kinase activity of MSKs to initiate the chromatin remodelling at the MIEP required for reactivation. Thus the importance of CREB during HCMV reactivation is to promote chromatin modifications conducive for viral gene expression as well as acting as a classical transcription factor. Clearly, specific inhibition of this interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention.
","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of immune-compromised individuals is a significant cause of morbidity. In a number of settings disease is caused by the reactivation of a pre-existing quiescent infection of the host (latency) which, in the absence of a controlling immune response, is a major source of disease. Work to understand the switch from a latent to active (reactivated) infection has focussed on the regulation of the promoter that controls the major viral gene products IE72 and IE86 – an important first step towards HCMV reactivation. In this study we have correlated the activation of cellular signalling pathways with the downstream activation of this promoter. Specifically, the activation of cellular kinase in an ERK-MAPK dependent manner which displays an affinity for a protein bound to a key viral promoter drives a change in the chromatin architecture that allows viral gene expression – releasing the virus from the latent state.

"We previously identified a novel gene family dispersed in the genome of Schistosoma japonicum by retrotransposon-mediated gene duplication mechanism. Although many transcripts were identified, no homolog was readily identifiable from sequence information.
Here, we utilized structural homology modeling and biochemical methods to identify remote homologs, and characterized the gene products as SEA (sea-urchin sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin)-domain containing proteins. A common extracellular domain in this family was structurally similar to SEA-domain. SEA-domain is primarily a structural domain, known to assist or regulate binding to glycans. Recombinant proteins from three members of this gene family specifically interacted with glycosaminoglycans with high affinity, with potential implication in ligand acquisition and immune evasion. Similar approach was used to identify a heme-binding site on the SEA-domain. The heme-binding mode showed heme molecule inserted into a hydrophobic pocket, with heme iron putatively coordinated to two histidine axial ligands. Heme-binding properties were confirmed using biochemical assays and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, which showed high affinity heme-binding (KD = 1.605×10−6 M) and cognate spectroscopic attributes of hexa-coordinated heme iron. The native proteins were oligomers, antigenic, and are localized on adult worm teguments and gastrodermis; major host-parasite interfaces and site for heme detoxification and acquisition.
The results suggest potential role, at least in the nucleation step of heme crystallization (hemozoin formation), and as receptors for heme uptake. Survival strategies exploited by parasites, including heme homeostasis mechanism in hemoparasites, are paramount for successful parasitism. Thus, assessing prospects for application in disease intervention is warranted.
","While isolating membrane-bound and secreted proteins as targets for Schistosoma japonicum vaccine, we identified a novel potentially functional gene family which had originated by a gene duplication mechanism. Here, we integrated structural homology modeling and biochemical methods to show that this gene family encodes proteins with sea-urchin sperm protein, enterokinase and agrin (SEA) –domain, with heme-binding properties. Typical of SEA-structural domains, the characterized proteins specifically interacted with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), with implication in ligand gathering and immune-evasion. Consistent with modeled heme-binding pocket, we observed high affinity heme-binding and spectroscopic attributes of hexa-coordinated heme iron. Localization of the native gene-products on adult worm tegument and gastrodermis, host interfaces for heme-sequestration and acquisition, suggests potential roles for this gene family in heme-detoxification and heme-iron uptake.

"Stress granules (SGs) contain stalled messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes and are related to the regulation of mRNA translation. Picornavirus infection can interfere with the formation of SGs. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms and functions of picornavirus-mediated regulation of SG formation are not clear. Here, we found that the 2A protease of a picornavirus, EV71, induced atypical stress granule (aSG), but not typical stress granule (tSG), formation via cleavage of eIF4GI. Furthermore, 2A was required and sufficient to inhibit tSGs induced by EV71 infection, sodium arsenite, or heat shock. Infection of 2A protease activity-inactivated recombinant EV71 (EV71-2AC110S) failed to induce aSG formation and only induced tSG formation, which is PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent. By using a Renilla luciferase mRNA reporter system and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, we found that EV71-induced aSGs were beneficial to viral translation through sequestering only cellular mRNAs, but not viral mRNAs. In addition, we found that the 2A protease of other picornaviruses such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus also induced aSG formation and blocked tSG formation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that, on one hand, EV71 infection induces tSG formation via the PKR-eIF2α pathway, and on the other hand, 2A, but not 3C, blocks tSG formation. Instead, 2A induces aSG formation by cleaving eIF4GI to sequester cellular mRNA but release viral mRNA, thereby facilitating viral translation.
","When cellular translation initiation is stalled, translation initiation complexes aggregate in cytoplasm. We call these aggregations stress granules (SGs), and they can be marked by components such as TIA-1. SGs are always considered to be antiviral structures during viral infection, but viruses also regulate SG formation to facilitate their survival. Here, we show that the 2A protease of EV71 induced TIA-1 foci formation, and we analyzed these TIA-1 foci and found that they were different from typical stress granules (tSGs); thus, we named them atypical stress granules (aSGs). 2A alone could block tSG formation, and we found that protease activity of 2A was required for aSG induction and tSG blockage, but functioned in different ways. When the protease activity of 2A in EV71 was blocked (EV71-2AC110S), the tSGs but not aSGs appeared in infected cells. These tSGs contained cellular and viral mRNAs and translation initiation factors to inhibit viral translation, but aSGs contained only cellular mRNAs to promote viral translation. We propose a model revealing that EV71 escapes cellular antiviral response by manipulating SG formation: 2A transforms the overall translation shutdown system to a selective virally beneficial system by switching from tSGs to aSGs.

"There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.
","Neuroscience is held back by the fact that it is hard to evaluate if a conclusion is correct; the complexity of the systems under study and their experimental inaccessability make the assessment of algorithmic and data analytic technqiues challenging at best. We thus argue for testing approaches using known artifacts, where the correct interpretation is known. Here we present a microprocessor platform as one such test case. We find that many approaches in neuroscience, when used naïvely, fall short of producing a meaningful understanding.

"All cells respond to osmotic stress by implementing molecular signaling events to protect the organism. Failure to properly adapt can lead to pathologies such as hypertension and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated in response to osmotic stress, as well as by signals acting through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). For proper adaptation, the action of these kinases must be coordinated. To identify second messengers of stress adaptation, we conducted a mass spectrometry-based global metabolomics profiling analysis, quantifying nearly 300 metabolites in the yeast S. cerevisiae. We show that three branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolites increase in response to osmotic stress and require the MAPK Hog1. Ectopic addition of these BCAA derivatives promotes phosphorylation of the G protein α subunit and dampens G protein-dependent transcription, similar to that seen in response to osmotic stress. Conversely, genetic ablation of Hog1 activity or the BCAA-regulatory enzymes leads to diminished phosphorylation of Gα and increased transcription. Taken together, our results define a new class of candidate second messengers that mediate cross talk between osmotic stress and GPCR signaling pathways.
","Just as organisms must adapt to a challenging environment, cells must respond to chemical or physical changes that occur within the organism. Regardless of the environmental cue, all cells use molecular signaling pathways to respond to those changes. Many are transmitted by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. While these pathways have been studied independently for decades, less is known about how they coordinate with each other to carry out the proper response, particularly when conflicting signals are present. One way coordination can be achieved is through “second messenger” molecules produced by one pathway to regulate another pathway. Here, we identify candidate second messengers of osmotic stress by global metabolite profiling analysis of the yeast S. cerevisiae. We find that three branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolites increase in response to osmotic stress and require the stress response MAPK Hog1. We show that these BCAA derivatives are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the effects of osmotic stress on the GPCR pathway. Our results identify a new way that HOG and GPCR pathways communicate, and may in the future guide better treatment strategies for stress-related cell damage.

"Studies of mice with Y chromosome long arm deficiencies suggest that the male-specific region (MSYq) encodes information required for sperm differentiation and postmeiotic sex chromatin repression (PSCR). Several genes have been identified on MSYq, but because they are present in more than 40 copies each, their functions cannot be investigated using traditional gene targeting. Here, we generate transgenic mice producing small interfering RNAs that specifically target the transcripts of the MSYq-encoded multicopy gene Sly (Sycp3-like Y-linked). Microarray analyses performed on these Sly-deficient males and on MSYq-deficient males show a remarkable up-regulation of sex chromosome genes in spermatids. SLY protein colocalizes with the X and Y chromatin in spermatids of normal males, and Sly deficiency leads to defective repressive marks on the sex chromatin, such as reduced levels of the heterochromatin protein CBX1 and of histone H3 methylated at lysine 9. Sly-deficient mice, just like MSYq-deficient mice, have severe impairment of sperm differentiation and are near sterile. We propose that their spermiogenesis phenotype is a consequence of the change in spermatid gene expression following Sly deficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first successful targeted disruption of the function of a multicopy gene (or of any Y gene). It shows that SLY has a predominant role in PSCR, either via direct interaction with the spermatid sex chromatin or via interaction with sex chromatin protein partners. Sly deficiency is the major underlying cause of the spectrum of anomalies identified 17 y ago in MSYq-deficient males. Our results also suggest that the expansion of sex-linked spermatid-expressed genes in mouse is a consequence of the enhancement of PSCR that accompanies Sly amplification.
","During meiosis in the male mouse, the X and Y chromosomes are transcriptionally silenced, and retain a significant degree of repression after meiosis. Postmeiotically, X and Y chromosome–encoded genes are consequently expressed at a low level, with the exception of genes present in many copies, which can achieve a higher level of expression. Gene amplification is a notable feature of the X and Y chromosomes, and it has been proposed that this serves to compensate for the postmeiotic repression. The long arm of the mouse Y chromosome (MSYq) has multicopy genes organized in clusters over several megabases. On the basis of analysis of mice carrying MSYq deletions, we proposed that MSYq encodes genetic information that is crucial for postmeiotic repression of the sex chromosomes and for sperm differentiation. The gene(s) responsible for these functions were, however, unknown. In this study, using transgenically delivered small interfering RNA, we disrupted the function of Sly, a gene that is present in more than 100 copies on MSYq. Sly-deficient males have major sperm differentiation problems together with a remarkable postmeiotic derepression of genes encoded on the X and Y chromosomes. Furthermore, the epigenetic modifications normally associated with sex chromosome repression are altered. Our data thus show that the SLY protein is required to mediate postmeiotic repression of the X and Y chromosomes. It is likely that the sperm differentiation problems in Sly-deficient males are largely a consequence of the derepression of the sex chromosomes in spermatids. We propose that the postmeiotic repressive effect of Sly on genes encoded on the X and Y chromosomes drove their massive amplification in the mouse.

"Examination of the human transcriptome reveals higher levels of RNA editing than in any other organism tested to date. This is indicative of extensive double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation within the human transcriptome. Most of the editing sites are located in the primate-specific retrotransposed element called Alu. A large fraction of Alus are found in intronic sequences, implying extensive Alu-Alu dsRNA formation in mRNA precursors. Yet, the effect of these intronic Alus on splicing of the flanking exons is largely unknown. Here, we show that more Alus flank alternatively spliced exons than constitutively spliced ones; this is especially notable for those exons that have changed their mode of splicing from constitutive to alternative during human evolution. This implies that Alu insertions may change the mode of splicing of the flanking exons. Indeed, we demonstrate experimentally that two Alu elements that were inserted into an intron in opposite orientation undergo base-pairing, as evident by RNA editing, and affect the splicing patterns of a downstream exon, shifting it from constitutive to alternative. Our results indicate the importance of intronic Alus in influencing the splicing of flanking exons, further emphasizing the role of Alus in shaping of the human transcriptome.
","The human genome is crowded with over one million copies of primate-specific retrotransposed elements, termed Alu. A large fraction of Alu elements are located within intronic sequences. The human transcriptome undergoes extensive RNA editing (A-to-I), to higher levels than any other tested organism. RNA editing requires the formation of a double-stranded RNA structure in order to occur. Over 90% of the editing sites in the human transcriptome are found within Alu sequences. Thus, the high level of RNA editing is indicative of extensive secondary structure formation in mRNA precursors driven by intronic Alu-Alu base pairing. Splicing is a molecular mechanism in which introns are removed from an mRNA precursor and exons are ligated to form a mature mRNA. Here, we show that Alu insertions into introns can affect the splicing of the flanking exons. We experimentally demonstrate that two Alu elements that were inserted into the same intron in opposite orientation undergo base-pairing, and consequently shift the splicing pattern of the downstream exon from constitutive inclusion in all mature mRNA molecules to alternative skipping. This emphasizes the impact of Alu elements on the primate-specific transcriptome evolution, as such events can generate new isoforms that might acquire novel functions.

"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods applied to bacterial genomes have shown promising results for genetic marker discovery or detailed assessment of marker effect. Recently, alignment-free methods based on k-mer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are sometimes hard to interpret. Here we introduce DBGWAS, an extended k-mer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with distinct phenotypes. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes, identified by the association model, into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. In particular, it does not require prior annotation or reference genomes. It produces subgraphs representing phenotype-associated genetic variants such as local polymorphisms and mobile genetic elements (MGE). It offers a graphical framework which helps interpret GWAS results. Importantly it is also computationally efficient—experiments took one hour and a half on average. We validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa—along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature. An open-source tool implementing DBGWAS is available at https://gitlab.com/leoisl/dbgwas.
","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) help explore the genetic bases of phenotype variation in a population. Our objective is to make GWAS amenable to bacterial genomes. These genomes can be too different to be aligned against a reference, even within a single species, making the description of their genetic variation challenging. We test the association between the phenotype and the presence in the genomes of DNA subsequences of length k – the so-called k-mers. These k-mers provide a versatile descriptor, allowing to capture genetic variants ranging from local polymorphisms to insertions of large mobile genetic elements. Unfortunately, they are also redundant and difficult to interpret. We rely on the compacted De Bruijn graph (cDBG), which represents the overlaps between k-mers. A single cDBG is built across all genomes, automatically removing the redundancy among consecutive k-mers, and allowing for a visualisation of the genomic context of the significant ones. We provide a computationally efficient and user-friendly implementation, enabling non-bioinformaticians to carry out GWAS on thousands of isolates in a few hours. This approach was effective in catching the dynamics of mobile genetic elements in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes, and retrieved known local polymorphisms in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes.

"TNF expression of macrophages is under stringent translational control that depends on the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway and the AU–rich element (ARE) in the TNF mRNA. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of phosphorylation-regulated translation of TNF. We demonstrate that translation of the TNF-precursor at the ER requires expression of the ARE–binding and -stabilizing factor human antigen R (HuR) together with either activity of the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway or the absence of the ARE-binding and -destabilizing factor tristetraprolin (TTP). We show that phosphorylation of TTP by MK2 decreases its affinity to the ARE, inhibits its ability to replace HuR, and permits HuR-mediated initiation of translation of TNF mRNA. Since translation of TTP's own mRNA is also regulated by this mechanism, an intrinsic feedback control of the inflammatory response is ensured. The phosphorylation-regulated TTP/HuR exchange at target mRNAs provides a reversible switch between unstable/non-translatable and stable/efficiently translated mRNAs.
","For immediate response and better control of gene expression, eukaryotic cells have developed means to specifically regulate the stability and translation of pre-formed mRNA transcripts. This post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is realized by a variety of mRNA-binding proteins, which target specific mRNA sequence elements in a signal-dependent manner. Here we describe a molecular switch mechanism where the exchange of two mRNA-binding proteins is regulated by stress and inflammatory signals. This switch operates between stabilization and efficient translation of the target mRNA, when the activator protein of translational initiation binds instead of the phosphorylated destabilizing protein, and translational arrest and degradation of the target, when the non-phosphorylated destabilizing protein replaces the activator. This mechanism is specific to the mRNA of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and the mRNA of its regulator protein TTP and, hence, enables fast inflammatory response and its stringent feedback control.

"Nutrient acquisition is a critical determinant for the competitive advantage for auto- and osmohetero- trophs alike. Nutrient limited growth is commonly described on a whole cell basis through reference to a maximum growth rate (Gmax) and a half-saturation constant (KG). This empirical application of a Michaelis-Menten like description ignores the multiple underlying feedbacks between physiology contributing to growth, cell size, elemental stoichiometry and cell motion. Here we explore these relationships with reference to the kinetics of the nutrient transporter protein, the transporter rate density at the cell surface (TRD; potential transport rate per unit plasma-membrane area), and diffusion gradients. While the half saturation value for the limiting nutrient increases rapidly with cell size, significant mitigation is afforded by cell motion (swimming or sedimentation), and by decreasing the cellular carbon density. There is thus potential for high vacuolation and high sedimentation rates in diatoms to significantly decrease KG and increase species competitive advantage. Our results also suggest that Gmax for larger non-diatom protists may be constrained by rates of nutrient transport. For a given carbon density, cell size and TRD, the value of Gmax/KG remains constant. This implies that species or strains with a lower Gmax might coincidentally have a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions as they also express lower values of KG. The ability of cells to modulate the TRD according to their nutritional status, and hence change the instantaneous maximum transport rate, has a very marked effect upon transport and growth kinetics. Analyses and dynamic models that do not consider such modulation will inevitably fail to properly reflect competitive advantage in nutrient acquisition. This has important implications for the accurate representation and predictive capabilities of model applications, in particular in a changing environment.
","Relating environmental nutrient concentration and nutrient acquisition to cell growth is an important feature of numerical simulations describing ecological systems of microbes. Here we investigate the critical role of the combined effects of maximum growth rate, cell size, motion, and elemental stoichiometry on nutrient transport kinetics and thence growth kinetics. By applying mechanistic scaling of nutrient uptake our results identify fundamental shortcomings in the interpretation of empirically derived relationships used to describe nutrient uptake in microbes. While the amount of nutrient required to grow at a given rate under nutrient limited conditions increases rapidly with cell size, the maximum growth rate scales directly with the environmental nutrient concentration. Requiring less nutrient at lower maximum growth rates, cells can therefore remain healthier at lower resource abundance. Further, decreased carbon content per cell lowers demand for nutrient transport per surface area significantly. This allows larger phytoplankton cells, like diatoms, to significantly increase their competitive advantage with increasing sedimentation rates. These findings have important implications for numerical models both in a context of theoretical ecology and applied science. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for organism physiology and related feedbacks in ecological applications and climate change studies.

"Control of tsetse flies using insecticide-treated targets is often hampered by vegetation re-growth and encroachment which obscures a target and renders it less effective. Potentially this is of particular concern for the newly developed small targets (0.25 high × 0.5 m wide) which show promise for cost-efficient control of Palpalis group tsetse flies. Consequently the performance of a small target was investigated for Glossina fuscipes fuscipes in Kenya, when the target was obscured following the placement of vegetation to simulate various degrees of natural bush encroachment. Catches decreased significantly only when the target was obscured by more than 80%. Even if a small target is underneath a very low overhanging bush (0.5 m above ground), the numbers of G. f. fuscipes decreased by only about 30% compared to a target in the open. We show that the efficiency of the small targets, even in small (1 m diameter) clearings, is largely uncompromised by vegetation re-growth because G. f. fuscipes readily enter between and under vegetation. The essential characteristic is that there should be some openings between vegetation.
This implies that for this important vector of HAT, and possibly other Palpalis group flies, a smaller initial clearance zone around targets can be made and longer interval between site maintenance visits is possible both of which will result in cost savings for large scale operations. We also investigated and discuss other site features e.g. large solid objects and position in relation to the water's edge in terms of the efficacy of the small targets.
","Sleeping Sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis) is a serious threat to health and development in sub-Saharan Africa. Due to lack of vaccines and prophylactic drugs, vector control is the only method of disease prevention. Small (0.25×0.5 m) insecticide-treated targets have been shown to be cost-efficient for several Palpalis group tsetse flies, but there are concerns that they may become obscured by vegetation with a subsequent reduction in efficiency. We showed that the efficiency of the small targets was largely uncompromised by vegetation encroachment because G. f. fuscipes readily enter between and under vegetation to locate a small target, e.g. into small (1 m diameter) site clearings and underneath a very low (0.5 m) canopy. This implies that the dense vegetation, typical of the riverine habitats of Palpalis group tsetse, will not compromise the performance of tiny targets, as long as there are adequate openings of >30 cm between vegetation. Moreover, the maintanence of cleared areas around targets seems less important for the control of G. f. fuscipes with consequent savings in costs for control operations.

"Nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbioses (RNS) occur in two major forms—Actinorhiza and legume-rhizobium symbiosis—which differ in bacterial partner, intracellular infection pattern, and morphogenesis. The phylogenetic restriction of nodulation to eurosid angiosperms indicates a common and recent evolutionary invention, but the molecular steps involved are still obscure. In legumes, at least seven genes—including the symbiosis receptor-kinase gene SYMRK—are essential for the interaction with rhizobia bacteria and for the Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis with phosphate-acquiring fungi, which is widespread in occurrence and believed to date back to the earliest land plants. We show that SYMRK is also required for Actinorhiza symbiosis of the cucurbit Datisca glomerata with actinobacteria of the genus Frankia, revealing a common genetic basis for both forms of RNS. We found that SYMRK exists in at least three different structural versions, of which the shorter forms from rice and tomato are sufficient for AM, but not for functional endosymbiosis with bacteria in the legume Lotus japonicus. Our data support the idea that SYMRK sequence evolution was involved in the recruitment of a pre-existing signalling network from AM, paving the way for the evolution of intracellular root symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
","As an adaptation to nutrient limitations in terrestrial ecosystems, most plants form Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (AM), which is a symbiotic relationship between phosphate-delivering fungi and plant roots that dates back to the earliest land plants. More recently, a small group including the legumes and close relatives has evolved the ability to accommodate nitrogen-fixing bacteria intracellularly. The resulting symbiosis is manifested by the formation of specialized root organs, the nodules, and comes in two forms: the interaction of legumes with rhizobia, and the more widespread Actinorhiza symbiosis of mostly woody plants with Frankia bacteria. The symbiosis receptor kinase SYMRK acts in a signalling pathway that legume plants require to trigger the development of nodules and the uptake of fungi or bacteria into their root cells. Here we show that the induction of Actinorhiza nodulation also relies on SYMRK, consistent with the idea that both types of nodulation evolved by recruiting common signalling genes from the pre-existing AM program. We observed that SYMRK from different land plant lineages differs significantly in exon composition, with a “full-length” version in the nodulating clade and shorter SYMRK genes in plants outside this lineage. Only the most complete SYMRK version was fully functional in nodulation, suggesting this gene played a central role in the recruitment event associated with the evolution of intracellular root symbioses with bacteria.

"Mammalian BET proteins comprise a family of bromodomain-containing epigenetic regulators with complex functions in chromatin organization and gene regulation. We identified the sole member of the BET protein family in Drosophila, Fs(1)h, as an inhibitor of the stress responsive transcription factor CncC, the fly ortholog of Nrf2. Fs(1)h physically interacts with CncC in a manner that requires the function of its bromodomains and the acetylation of CncC. Treatment of cultured Drosophila cells or adult flies with fs(1)h RNAi or with the BET protein inhibitor JQ1 de-represses CncC transcriptional activity and engages protective gene expression programs. The mechanism by which Fs(1)h inhibits CncC function is distinct from the canonical mechanism that stimulates Nrf2 function by abrogating Keap1-dependent proteasomal degradation. Consistent with the independent modes of CncC regulation by Keap1 and Fs(1)h, combinations of drugs that can specifically target these pathways cause a strong synergistic and specific activation of protective CncC- dependent gene expression and boosts oxidative stress resistance. This synergism might be exploitable for the design of combinatorial therapies to target diseases associated with oxidative stress or inflammation.
","Nrf2-related transcription factors regulate gene expression programs that protect organisms against chemical or oxidative stress. Nrf2-activating drugs hold promise for the treatment of diseases that are connected to oxidative stress or inflammation. We identified Fs(1)h, a bromodomain-containing BET protein, as a negative regulator of Nrf2 function in Drosophila. BET proteins are involved in transcription regulation and chromatin organization and have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer. Fs(1)h interacts with acetylated lysines on CncC, the homolog of Nrf2 in Drosophila, and thereby prevents target gene activation. Nrf2 can be released from this inhibitory effect by small molecules that specifically interfere with the binding of BET proteins to acetylated targets. Fs(1)h regulates Nrf2 independently of Keap1, a well-studied Nrf2 regulator. Consequently, chemical inhibitors of Keap1 and of Fs(1)h can be combined to achieve synergistic activation of Nrf2 target genes and strongly boost oxidative stress tolerance in Drosophila. The Keap1-independent mechanism of Nrf2 regulation is conserved in mammals. We suggest that the synergistic effect of combinatorial Nrf2 targeting drugs may be effective for the treatment of different oxidative stress and inflammation-related diseases.

"Animal African trypanosomosis, a disease mainly caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense, is a major constraint to livestock productivity and has a significant impact in the developing countries of Africa. RNA interference (RNAi) has been used to study gene function and identify drug and vaccine targets in a variety of organisms including trypanosomes. However, trypanosome RNAi studies have mainly been conducted in T. brucei, as a model for human infection, largely ignoring livestock parasites of economical importance such as T. congolense, which displays different pathogenesis profiles. The whole T. congolense life cycle can be completed in vitro, but this attractive model displayed important limitations: (i) genetic tools were currently limited to insect forms and production of modified infectious BSF through differentiation was never achieved, (ii) in vitro differentiation techniques lasted several months, (iii) absence of long-term bloodstream forms (BSF) in vitro culture prevented genomic analyses.
We optimized culture conditions for each developmental stage and secured the differentiation steps. Specifically, we devised a medium adapted for the strenuous development of stable long-term BSF culture. Using Amaxa nucleofection technology, we greatly improved the transfection rate of the insect form and designed an inducible transgene expression system using the IL3000 reference strain. We tested it by expression of reporter genes and through RNAi. Subsequently, we achieved the complete in vitro life cycle with dramatically shortened time requirements for various wild type and transgenic strains. Finally, we established the use of modified strains for experimental infections and underlined a host adaptation phase requirement.
We devised an improved T. congolense model, which offers the opportunity to perform functional genomics analyses throughout the whole life cycle. It represents a very useful tool to understand pathogenesis mechanisms and to study potential therapeutic targets either in vitro or in vivo using a mouse model.
","Trypanosoma congolense is a parasite responsible for severe disease of African livestock. Its life cycle is complex and divided into two phases, one in the tsetse fly vector and one in the bloodstream of the mammalian host. Molecular tools for gene function analyses in parasitic organisms are essential. Previous studies described the possibility of completing the entire T. congolense life cycle in vitro. However, the model showed major flaws including the absence of stable long-term culture of the infectious bloodstream forms, a laborious time-consuming period to perform the cycle and a lack of genetic tools. We therefore aimed to develop a standardized model convenient for genetic engineering. We succeeded in producing long-term cultures of all the developmental stages on long-term, to define all the differentiation steps and to finally complete the whole cycle in vitro. This improved model offers the opportunity to conduct phenotype analyses of genetically modified strains throughout the in vitro cycle and also during experimental infections.

"The binding of bacteria to human platelets is a likely central mechanism in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. We have previously found that platelet binding by Streptococcus mitis SF100 is mediated by surface components encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage, SM1. We now demonstrate that SM1-encoded lysin contributes to platelet binding via its direct interaction with fibrinogen. Far Western blotting of platelets revealed that fibrinogen was the major membrane-associated protein bound by lysin. Analysis of lysin binding with purified fibrinogen in vitro confirmed that these proteins could bind directly, and that this interaction was both saturable and inhibitable. Lysin bound both the Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen, but not the γ subunit. Binding of lysin to the Bβ chain was further localized to a region within the fibrinogen D fragment. Disruption of the SF100 lysin gene resulted in an 83±3.1% reduction (mean ± SD) in binding to immobilized fibrinogen by this mutant strain (PS1006). Preincubation of this isogenic mutant with purified lysin restored fibrinogen binding to wild type levels. When tested in a co-infection model of endocarditis, loss of lysin expression resulted in a significant reduction in virulence, as measured by achievable bacterial densities (CFU/g) within vegetations, kidneys, and spleens. These results indicate that bacteriophage-encoded lysin is a multifunctional protein, representing a new class of fibrinogen-binding proteins. Lysin appears to be cell wall-associated through its interaction with choline. Once on the bacterial surface, lysin can bind fibrinogen directly, which appears to be an important interaction for the pathogenesis of endocarditis.

"Plasmodium falciparum is the major human malaria agent responsible for 200 to 300 million infections and one to three million deaths annually, mainly among African infants. The origin and evolution of this pathogen within the human lineage is still unresolved. A single species, P. reichenowi, which infects chimpanzees, is known to be a close sister lineage of P. falciparum. Here we report the discovery of a new Plasmodium species infecting Hominids. This new species has been isolated in two chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) kept as pets by villagers in Gabon (Africa). Analysis of its complete mitochondrial genome (5529 nucleotides including Cyt b, Cox I and Cox III genes) reveals an older divergence of this lineage from the clade that includes P. falciparum and P. reichenowi (∼21±9 Myrs ago using Bayesian methods and considering that the divergence between P. falciparum and P. reichenowi occurred 4 to 7 million years ago as generally considered in the literature). This time frame would be congruent with the radiation of hominoids, suggesting that this Plasmodium lineage might have been present in early hominoids and that they may both have experienced a simultaneous diversification. Investigation of the nuclear genome of this new species will further the understanding of the genetic adaptations of P. falciparum to humans. The risk of transfer and emergence of this new species in humans must be now seriously considered given that it was found in two chimpanzees living in contact with humans and its close relatedness to the most virulent agent of malaria.
","In 2002, the publication of the genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the most malignant agent of malaria, generated hopes in the fight against this deadly disease by the opportunities it offered to discover new drug targets. Since then results have not lived up to the expectations. The development of comparative genomics to further understanding of P. falciparum has indeed been hindered by a lack of knowledge of closely related species' genomes. Only one species, P. reichenowi, infecting chimpanzees, was hitherto known as a sister lineage of P. falciparum. Here we describe a new Plasmodium species infecting chimpanzees in Africa. Based on its whole mitochondrial genome, we demonstrate that this species is a relative of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi. The analysis of its genome should thus offer the opportunity to explore P. falciparum specific adaptations to humans. Our results bring new elements to the debate surrounding the origin of this lineage. They suggest that it may have been present in early hominoids and may have experienced a radiation congruent with that of its hosts. Our discovery highlights the paucity of our knowledge on the richness of Plasmodium species infecting primates and calls for more research in this direction.

"5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine, approved by the FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells where it specifically inhibits DNA methylation by forming covalent complexes with the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). In an effort to study the correlations between DNA methylation, nucleosome remodeling, and gene reactivation, we investigate the integrated epigenetic events that worked coordinately to reprogram the methylated and closed promoters back to permissive chromatin configurations after 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment. The ChIP results indicate that H2A.Z is deposited at promoter regions by the Snf2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP) complex following DNA demethylation. According to our genome-wide expression and DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe–seq (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome–sequencing) assay. In contrast, SRCAP–mediated H2A.Z deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of constitutively expressed genes. By combining Hpa II digestion with NOMe–seq assay, we show that hemimethylated DNA, which is generated following drug incorporation, remains occupied by nucleosomes. Our data highlight H2A.Z as a novel and essential factor involved in 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine–induced gene reactivation. Furthermore, we elucidate that chromatin remodeling translates the demethylation ability of DNMT inhibitors to their downstream efficacies, suggesting future therapeutic implications for chromatin remodelers.
","Epigenetic changes, which include chemical modifications to the DNA and changes in the proteins that package DNA to fit into a cell, play an important role in gene expression regulation. The fact that a number of abnormal epigenetic changes that lead to the silencing of genes occur during tumorigenesis has prompted the design of epigenetic therapies. The ultimate goal of these therapies is to reverse the aberrant epigenetic modifications observed in cancer cells, thereby restoring cells to a “normal” state. 5-Aza-CdDR, a FDA approved drug for MDS treatment, reverses a chemical modification of the DNA resulting in gene reactivation. The data presented here show the importance of H2A.Z, a special DNA packaging protein variant, in the gene reactivation process induced by 5-Aza-CdR. The presence of H2A.Z facilitates the access of proteins at gene regulatory regions, which is a necessary step for gene re-expression. A better understanding of the events that follow 5-Aza-CdR treatment is a necessary step towards the design of combination and/or personalized epigenetic therapies.

"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne zoonotic agent that is maintained in nature in an enzootic vertebrate-tick-vertebrate cycle. Hyalomma genus ticks have been implicated as the main CCHFV vector and are key in maintaining silent endemic foci. However, what contributes to their central role in CCHFV ecology is unclear. To assess the significance of host preferences of ticks in CCHFV ecology, we performed comparative analyses of hosts exploited by 133 species of ticks; these species represent 5 genera with reported geographical distribution over the range of CCHFV. We found that the composition of vertebrate hosts on which Hyalomma spp. feed is different than for other tick genera. Immatures of the genus Hyalomma feed preferentially on species of the orders Rodentia, Lagomorpha, and the class Aves, while adults concentrate mainly on the family Bovidae. With the exception of Aves, these hosts include the majority of the vertebrates consistently reported to be viremic upon CCHFV infection. While other tick genera also feed on these hosts, Hyalomma spp. almost completely concentrate their populations on them. Hyalomma spp. feed on less phylogenetically diverse hosts than any other tick genus, implying that this network of hosts has a low resilience. Indeed, removing the most prominent hosts quickly collapsed the network of parasitic interactions. These results support the intermittent activity of CCHFV foci: likely, populations of infected Hyalomma spp. ticks exceed the threshold of contact with humans only when these critical hosts reach adequate population density, accounting for the sporadic occurence of clinical tick-transmitted cases. Our data describe the association of vertebrate host preferences with the role of Hyalomma spp. ticks in maintaining endemic CCHFV foci, and highlight the importance of host-tick dynamics in pathogen ecology.
","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a cause of severe hemorragic disease in humans, is maintained in nature in a tick-vertebrate-tick enzootic cycle characterized by silent persistence of endemic foci with intermittent epidemics. Most studies support ticks of the genus Hyalomma as the main CCHFV vectors, but some laboratory reports and field studies also allude to other tick species that may be responsible for virus circulation. Here we converted the tick-host interactions of 133 species of ticks with reported geographical distribution over the range of CCHFV into a network of relationships. By a series of network analyses, we found that immatures of the genus Hyalomma are unique in their hosts preferences among the examined tick genera. Immatures of the genus Hyalomma concentrate on rodent and rabbit hosts, which most efficiently support CCHFV maintenance and transmission by ticks in nature. Based on these data, we formulate the hypothesis that the ecological relationships between Hyalomma spp. and their hosts form a delicate equilibrum that differentiates human epidemics from periods of silent CCHFV maintenance.

"Maximum entropy models are the least structured probability distributions that exactly reproduce a chosen set of statistics measured in an interacting network. Here we use this principle to construct probabilistic models which describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of up to 120 neurons in the salamander retina as it responds to natural movies. Already in groups as small as 10 neurons, interactions between spikes can no longer be regarded as small perturbations in an otherwise independent system; for 40 or more neurons pairwise interactions need to be supplemented by a global interaction that controls the distribution of synchrony in the population. Here we show that such “K-pairwise” models—being systematic extensions of the previously used pairwise Ising models—provide an excellent account of the data. We explore the properties of the neural vocabulary by: 1) estimating its entropy, which constrains the population's capacity to represent visual information; 2) classifying activity patterns into a small set of metastable collective modes; 3) showing that the neural codeword ensembles are extremely inhomogenous; 4) demonstrating that the state of individual neurons is highly predictable from the rest of the population, allowing the capacity for error correction.
","Sensory neurons encode information about the world into sequences of spiking and silence. Multi-electrode array recordings have enabled us to move from single units to measuring the responses of many neurons simultaneously, and thus to ask questions about how populations of neurons as a whole represent their input signals. Here we build on previous work that has shown that in the salamander retina, pairs of retinal ganglion cells are only weakly correlated, yet the population spiking activity exhibits large departures from a model where the neurons would be independent. We analyze data from more than a hundred salamander retinal ganglion cells and characterize their collective response using maximum entropy models of statistical physics. With these models in hand, we can put bounds on the amount of information encoded by the neural population, constructively demonstrate that the code has error correcting redundancy, and advance two hypotheses about the neural code: that collective states of the network could carry stimulus information, and that the distribution of neural activity patterns has very nontrivial statistical properties, possibly related to critical systems in statistical physics.

"Vector ticks possess a unique system that enables them to digest large amounts of host blood and to transmit various animal and human pathogens, suggesting the existence of evolutionally acquired proteolytic mechanisms. We report here the molecular and reverse genetic characterization of a multifunctional cysteine protease, longipain, from the babesial parasite vector tick Haemaphysalis longicornis. Longipain shares structural similarity with papain-family cysteine proteases obtained from invertebrates and vertebrates. Endogenous longipain was mainly expressed in the midgut epithelium and was specifically localized at lysosomal vacuoles and possibly released into the lumen. Its expression was up-regulated by host blood feeding. Enzymatic functional assays using in vitro and in vivo substrates revealed that longipain hydrolysis occurs over a broad range of pH and temperature. Haemoparasiticidal assays showed that longipain dose-dependently killed tick-borne Babesia parasites, and its babesiacidal effect occurred via specific adherence to the parasite membranes. Disruption of endogenous longipain by RNA interference revealed that longipain is involved in the digestion of the host blood meal. In addition, the knockdown ticks contained an increased number of parasites, suggesting that longipain exerts a killing effect against the midgut-stage Babesia parasites in ticks. Our results suggest that longipain is essential for tick survival, and may have a role in controlling the transmission of tick-transmittable Babesia parasites.
","Ticks are important ectoparasites among the blood-feeding arthropods and serve as vectors of many deadly diseases of humans and animals. Of tick-transmitted pathogens, Babesia, an intracellular haemoprotozoan parasite causing a malaria-like disease, called babesiosis, gain increasing interest due to its zoonotic significance. When vector ticks acquire the protozoa via blood-meals, they invade midgut and undergo several developmental stages prior to exit through salivary glands. It has long been conceived that midguts of these ticks evolve diverse innate immune mechanisms and perform blood digestion critical for tick survival. A cysteine proteinase, longipain, was identified from the three-host tick Haemaphysalis longicornis, which shows potent parasiticidal activity. Longipain is localized in midgut epithelium and its expression is induced by blood feeding. This protein is passively secreted into midgut lumen where it exerts enzymatic degradation of blood-meals. A series of experiments unveil that longipain-knockdown ticks when fed on Babesia-infected dog, exhibited a significantly increased numbers of parasites compared with controls. Longipain has shown to interact on the surface of Babesia parasites in vitro and in vivo, and is thought to mediate direct killing of the parasites, suggesting that longipain may be a potential chemotherapeutic target against babesiosis and ticks themselves.

"Cytochrome c oxidases (Ccoxs) are the terminal enzymes of the respiratory chain in mitochondria and most bacteria. These enzymes couple dioxygen (O2) reduction to the generation of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. Despite decades of research and the availability of a large amount of structural and biochemical data available for the A-type Ccox family, little is known about the channel(s) used by O2 to travel from the solvent/membrane to the heme a3-CuB binuclear center (BNC). Moreover, the identification of all possible O2 channels as well as the atomic details of O2 diffusion is essential for the understanding of the working mechanisms of the A-type Ccox. In this work, we determined the O2 distribution within Ccox from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, in the fully reduced state, in order to identify and characterize all the putative O2 channels leading towards the BNC. For that, we use an integrated strategy combining atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (with and without explicit O2 molecules) and implicit ligand sampling (ILS) calculations. Based on the 3D free energy map for O2 inside Ccox, three channels were identified, all starting in the membrane hydrophobic region and connecting the surface of the protein to the BNC. One of these channels corresponds to the pathway inferred from the X-ray data available, whereas the other two are alternative routes for O2 to reach the BNC. Both alternative O2 channels start in the membrane spanning region and terminate close to Y288I. These channels are a combination of multiple transiently interconnected hydrophobic cavities, whose opening and closure is regulated by the thermal fluctuations of the lining residues. Furthermore, our results show that, in this Ccox, the most likely (energetically preferred) routes for O2 to reach the BNC are the alternative channels, rather than the X-ray inferred pathway.
","Cytochrome c oxidases (Ccoxs), the terminal enzymes of the respiratory electron transport chain in eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, are key enzymes in aerobic respiration. These proteins couple the reduction of molecular dioxygen to water with the creation of a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. Over the last decades, most of the Ccoxs research focused on the mechanisms and energetics of reduction and/or proton pumping, and little emphasis has been given to the pathways used by dioxygen to reach the binuclear center, where dioxygen reduction takes place. In particular, the existence and the characteristics of the channel(s) used by O2 to travel from the solvent/membrane to the binuclear site are still unclear. In this work, we combine all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and implicit ligand sampling calculations in order to identify and characterize the O2 delivery channels in the Ccox from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Altogether, our results suggest that, in this Ccox, O2 can diffuse via three well-defined channels that start in membrane region (where O2 solubility is higher than in the water). One of these channels corresponds to the pathway inferred from the X-ray data available, whereas the other two are alternative routes for O2 to reach the binuclear center.

"Despite a high current standard of care in antiretroviral therapy for HIV, multidrug-resistant strains continue to emerge, underscoring the need for additional novel mechanism inhibitors that will offer expanded therapeutic options in the clinic. We report a new class of small molecule antiretroviral compounds that directly target HIV-1 capsid (CA) via a novel mechanism of action. The compounds exhibit potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 laboratory strains, clinical isolates, and HIV-2, and inhibit both early and late events in the viral replication cycle. We present mechanistic studies indicating that these early and late activities result from the compound affecting viral uncoating and assembly, respectively. We show that amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 CA are sufficient to confer resistance to this class of compounds, identifying CA as the target in infected cells. A high-resolution co-crystal structure of the compound bound to HIV-1 CA reveals a novel binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of the protein. Our data demonstrate that broad-spectrum antiviral activity can be achieved by targeting this new binding site and reveal HIV CA as a tractable drug target for HIV therapy.
","Although the current standard of care for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is high, viral resistance has emerged to every drug currently in the clinic, in some cases rendering the entire class ineffective for patients. A new class of antiretroviral drugs would be effective against strains of HIV-1 that are resistant to any existing drug and would expand the therapeutic options available to patients. Capsid is the primary structural protein of HIV and a critical part of the viral replication cycle, both in the assembly of viral particles and in the infection of host cells. We report a new class of antiretrovirals that targets HIV-1 capsid and demonstrate that it is active at two critical stages in the viral replication cycle. These compounds were consistently effective against a range of clinical strains of HIV-1, from various sub-types, as well as HIV-2. Finally, the compounds bind in a unique pocket on capsid that has not previously been highlighted as a drug binding site. We believe this new class of antiretrovirals can serve as a starting point for the development of a new generation of HIV-1 therapeutics and, more generally, underscores the potential of capsid as a therapeutic target.

"Mechanisms of gene regulation are poorly understood in Apicomplexa, a phylum that encompasses deadly human pathogens like Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. Initial studies suggest that epigenetic phenomena, including histone modifications and chromatin remodeling, have a profound effect upon gene expression and expression of virulence traits. Using the model organism Toxoplasma gondii, we characterized the epigenetic organization and transcription patterns of a contiguous 1% of the T. gondii genome using custom oligonucleotide microarrays. We show that methylation and acetylation of histones H3 and H4 are landmarks of active promoters in T. gondii that allow us to deduce the position and directionality of gene promoters with >95% accuracy. These histone methylation and acetylation “activation” marks are strongly associated with gene expression. We also demonstrate that the pattern of histone H3 arginine methylation distinguishes certain promoters, illustrating the complexity of the histone modification machinery in Toxoplasma. By integrating epigenetic data, gene prediction analysis, and gene expression data from the tachyzoite stage, we illustrate feasibility of creating an epigenomic map of T. gondii tachyzoite gene expression. Further, we illustrate the utility of the epigenomic map to empirically and biologically annotate the genome and show that this approach enables identification of previously unknown genes. Thus, our epigenomics approach provides novel insights into regulation of gene expression in the Apicomplexa. In addition, with its compact genome, genetic tractability, and discrete life cycle stages, T. gondii provides an important new model to study the evolutionarily conserved components of the histone code.
","Apicomplexan parasites, including Toxoplasma gondii, are responsible for a variety of deadly infections, but little is understood about how these important pathogens regulate gene expression.

To understand the relationship of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation in T. gondii, we characterized the histone modifications and gene expression of a contiguous 1% of the T. gondii genome using custom DNA oligonucleotide microarrays. We found that active promoters have a characteristic pattern of histone modifications that correlates strongly with active gene expression in tachyzoites. These data, integrated with prior gene predictions, enable more accurate annotation of the genome and discovery of new genes. Further, these studies illustrate the power of an integrated epigenomic approach to illuminate the role of the “histone code” in regulation of gene expression in the Apicomplexa.

"Translation is divided into initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. Earlier work implicated several eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in ribosomal recycling in vitro. Here, we uncover roles for HCR1 and eIF3 in translation termination in vivo. A substantial proportion of eIF3, HCR1 and eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) but not eIF5 (a well-defined “initiation-specific” binding partner of eIF3) specifically co-sediments with 80S couples isolated from RNase-treated heavy polysomes in an eRF1-dependent manner, indicating the presence of eIF3 and HCR1 on terminating ribosomes. eIF3 and HCR1 also occur in ribosome- and RNA-free complexes with both eRFs and the recycling factor ABCE1/RLI1. Several eIF3 mutations reduce rates of stop codon read-through and genetically interact with mutant eRFs. In contrast, a slow growing deletion of hcr1 increases read-through and accumulates eRF3 in heavy polysomes in a manner suppressible by overexpressed ABCE1/RLI1. Based on these and other findings we propose that upon stop codon recognition, HCR1 promotes eRF3·GDP ejection from the post-termination complexes to allow binding of its interacting partner ABCE1/RLI1. Furthermore, the fact that high dosage of ABCE1/RLI1 fully suppresses the slow growth phenotype of hcr1Δ as well as its termination but not initiation defects implies that the termination function of HCR1 is more critical for optimal proliferation than its function in translation initiation. Based on these and other observations we suggest that the assignment of HCR1 as a bona fide eIF3 subunit should be reconsidered. Together our work characterizes novel roles of eIF3 and HCR1 in stop codon recognition, defining a communication bridge between the initiation and termination/recycling phases of translation.
","Protein synthesis (translation) utilizes genetic information carriers, mRNAs, as templates for the production of proteins of various cellular functions. Typically it is divided into four phases: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosomal recycling. In this article we argue that the strict mechanistic separation of translation into its individual phases should be reconsidered in the light of “multitasking” of initiation factors eIF3, HCR1 and ABCE1/RLI1. In detail, we show that eIF3 and HCR1 not only promote the initiation phase but also specifically act at the other end of the translational cycle during termination. We present genetic and biochemical data linking eIF3 and HCR1 with both eukaryotic release factors (eRF1 and eRF3) and the ribosomal recycling factor ABCE1/RLI1, and propose a model for how all these factors co-operate with each other to ensure stringent selection of the stop codon. Collectively, our findings suggest that changes in one phase of translation are promptly communicated to and coordinated with changes in the other phases to maintain cellular homeostasis of all ongoing processes.

"The MYC oncogene has been implicated in the regulation of up to thousands of genes involved in many cellular programs including proliferation, growth, differentiation, self-renewal, and apoptosis. MYC is thought to induce cancer through an exaggerated effect on these physiologic programs. Which of these genes are responsible for the ability of MYC to initiate and/or maintain tumorigenesis is not clear. Previously, we have shown that upon brief MYC inactivation, some tumors undergo sustained regression. Here we demonstrate that upon MYC inactivation there are global permanent changes in gene expression detected by microarray analysis. By applying StepMiner analysis, we identified genes whose expression most strongly correlated with the ability of MYC to induce a neoplastic state. Notably, genes were identified that exhibited permanent changes in mRNA expression upon MYC inactivation. Importantly, permanent changes in gene expression could be shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to be associated with permanent changes in the ability of MYC to bind to the promoter regions. Our list of candidate genes associated with tumor maintenance was further refined by comparing our analysis with other published results to generate a gene signature associated with MYC-induced tumorigenesis in mice. To validate the role of gene signatures associated with MYC in human tumorigenesis, we examined the expression of human homologs in 273 published human lymphoma microarray datasets in Affymetrix U133A format. One large functional group of these genes included the ribosomal structural proteins. In addition, we identified a group of genes involved in a diverse array of cellular functions including: BZW2, H2AFY, SFRS3, NAP1L1, NOLA2, UBE2D2, CCNG1, LIFR, FABP3, and EDG1. Hence, through our analysis of gene expression in murine tumor models and human lymphomas, we have identified a novel gene signature correlated with the ability of MYC to maintain tumorigenesis.
","The targeted inactivation of oncogenes may be a specific and effective treatment of cancer. However, how oncogene inactivation leads to tumor regression is not clear. Previously, we have shown that even the brief inactivation of the MYC oncogene can result in the sustained regression of at least some tumors. To understand the mechanism, we have utilized several novel genomic analyses to define a set of genes that strongly correlate with the ability of the MYC oncogene to maintain tumorigenesis. First, we generated a novel data set from microarray analyses of murine tumors that we analyzed by StepMiner to identify discrete step changes in gene expression after the inactivation or the reactivation of the MYC oncogene. Second, we utilized Boolean Network Analysis to further define the subset of genes highly correlated with MYC in human tumorigenesis. Third, we utilized ChIP analysis to demonstrate that in many cases the permanent changes of gene expression we uncovered were associated with changes in the ability of MYC to occupy the promoter locus. Our general strategy could be similarly utilized in other experimental model systems to understand how specific oncogenes contribute to the maintenance of tumorigenesis.

"Mycetoma is a unique neglected tropical disease which is endemic in what is known as the “mycetoma belt”. The disease has many devastating impacts on patients and communities in endemic area and is characterised by massive deformity, destruction and disability. Mycetoma is commonly seen in the foot and hand and less frequent in other parts of the body. Mycetoma of the head and neck is a rarity and is associated with high morbidity and even mortality if not treated early. In this communication we report on 49 patients with head and neck mycetoma followed up at the Mycetoma Research Centre in Khartoum. Most of the reported patients had actinomycetoma and the majority were young adult males from mycetoma endemic areas in the Sudan. Most of them were students, farmers and workers. Prior to presentation the majority had long disease duration and the cause was multifactorial. Advanced disease with massive lesion, deformity and disability was the common presentation. There was no obvious history of local trauma, familial tendency or other predisposing factor identified in this group of patients. MRI and CT scan were the most accurate diagnostic tools to determine the disease extent. The treatment outcome was rather poor and characterised by low cure rate, poor outcome and high follows-up dropout. Such a gloomy outcome calls for structured and objective health education programs.
","Although head and neck mycetoma is a rare disease entity yet it is a dreadful disease for the patient, the family and the treating physician. It is potentially fatal and the most challenging to treat. The current study highlighted that, most patients were young adult males, from rural areas of the Sudan and of low socioeconomic status. The lack of medical and health facilities, financial constrains and compounded by poor health education in endemic areas meant that most of the studied patients presented late with advanced disease. The diagnosis of mycetoma in the studied population was confirmed by several imaging techniques; MRI, CT scan and radiography and tissue diagnosis by histopathology and cytology techniques. The treatment outcome was rather unsatisfactory. The cure rate was low, the dropout rate was high and the disease was associated with high morbidity. Structured and objective health education programmes in the endemic areas is important to encourage patients to seek medical advice early in the course of the disease particularly that there is no clear preventive or control measurement in mycetoma.

"CULLIN3 (CUL3) together with BTB-domain proteins form a class of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (called CRL3s) that control the rapid and selective degradation of important regulatory proteins in all eukaryotes. Here, we report that in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, CUL3 regulates plant growth and development, not only during embryogenesis but also at post-embryonic stages. First, we show that CUL3 modulates the emission of ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone that is an important growth regulator. A CUL3 hypomorphic mutant accumulates ACS5, the rate-limiting enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis and as a consequence exhibits a constitutive ethylene response. Second, we provide evidence that CUL3 regulates primary root growth by a novel ethylene-dependant pathway. In particular, we show that CUL3 knockdown inhibits primary root growth by reducing root meristem size and cell number. This phenotype is suppressed by ethylene-insensitive or resistant mutations. Finally, we identify a function of CUL3 in distal root patterning, by a mechanism that is independent of ethylene. Thus, our work highlights that CUL3 is essential for the normal division and organisation of the root stem cell niche and columella root cap cells.
","Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays a central role in controlling intracellular levels of essential regulatory molecules in all eukaryotic organisms. This protein degradation pathway has a large number of components, including hundreds of ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) that are predicted to have regulatory roles in cell homeostasis, cell cycle control, and development. Recent research revealed the molecular composition of CULLIN3 (CUL3)-based E3 ligases, which are essential enzymes in both metazoans and plants. Here, we report that in the model plant A. thaliana, CUL3 modulates the emission of ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone that controls a variety of processes such as fruit ripening and stress response. In particular, we provide evidence that CUL3 regulates root growth by a novel ethylene-dependant pathway. Thus, we showed that CUL3 knockdown inhibits primary root growth by reducing the root meristem size. Finally, we also identified a function of CUL3 in distal root patterning. Indeed, CUL3 function is required for normal division and organisation of the root stem cell niche and columella root cap cells. Overall, our results show that Arabidopsis CUL3 is essential for plant growth and development, not only during embryogenesis but also at post-embryonic stages.

"Incidences of infection-related cancers are on the rise in developing countries where the prevalence of intestinal nematode worm infections are also high. Trichuris muris (T. muris) is a murine gut-dwelling nematode that is the direct model for human T. trichiura, one of the major soil-transmitted helminth infections of humans. In order to assess whether chronic infection with T. muris does indeed influence the development of cancer hallmarks, both wild type mice and colon cancer model (APC min/+) mice were infected with this parasite. Parasite infection in wild type mice led to the development of neoplastic change similar to that seen in mice that had been treated with the carcinogen azoxymethane. Additionally, both chronic and acute infection in the APCmin/+ mice led to an enhanced tumour development that was distinct to the site of infection suggesting systemic control. By blocking the parasite induced T regulatory response in these mice, the increase in the number of tumours following infection was abrogated. Thus T. muris infection alone causes an increase in gut pathologies that are known to be markers of cancer but also increases the incidence of tumour formation in a colon cancer model. The influence of parasitic worm infection on the development of cancer may therefore be significant.
","It is estimated that now 2 billion people currently live with chronic parasitic worm infections. As the incidences of cancer increase worldwide, the importance of these chronic inflammatory conditions on the development of cancer becomes more important. Several bacterial, viral and parasitic infections are already known to influence cancer development but as colon cancer is particularly prevalent worldwide, we wanted to assess the effect of a large intestinal dwelling worm, Trichuris muris (T. muris) on its aetiology. This whipworm is a natural infection of mice and has significant homology to human whipworm. From our studies, we showed that chronic infection alone induced changes in the caecum of the mouse that were comparable to those seen with a well-known carcinogen. In addition to this, T. muris infection was also able to increase the development of adenomas in the small intestine of mutant mice that spontaneously develop tumours. This change was abrogated if a T regulatory cell type was blocked during infection. The T regulatory cell type that arises during infection has been shown to play an important role in protecting the host from damage caused by the parasite and the immune response to it. The present study using the mouse model however, suggests that regulatory T cells can have negative effects, at least in terms of the development of bowel cancer. As so many people live with chronic, regulated parasitic infections, the importance of the parasites in cancer development may therefore be significant.

"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is caused by defects in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. NER removes helix-distorting DNA lesions, such as UV–induced photodimers, from the genome. Patients suffering from XP exhibit exquisite sun sensitivity, high incidence of skin cancer, and in some cases neurodegeneration. The severity of XP varies tremendously depending upon which NER gene is mutated and how severely the mutation affects DNA repair capacity. XPF-ERCC1 is a structure-specific endonuclease essential for incising the damaged strand of DNA in NER. Missense mutations in XPF can result not only in XP, but also XPF-ERCC1 (XFE) progeroid syndrome, a disease of accelerated aging. In an attempt to determine how mutations in XPF can lead to such diverse symptoms, the effects of a progeria-causing mutation (XPFR153P) were compared to an XP–causing mutation (XPFR799W) in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant XPF harboring either mutation was purified in a complex with ERCC1 and tested for its ability to incise a stem-loop structure in vitro. Both mutant complexes nicked the substrate indicating that neither mutation obviates catalytic activity of the nuclease. Surprisingly, differential immunostaining and fractionation of cells from an XFE progeroid patient revealed that XPF-ERCC1 is abundant in the cytoplasm. This was confirmed by fluorescent detection of XPFR153P-YFP expressed in Xpf mutant cells. In addition, microinjection of XPFR153P-ERCC1 into the nucleus of XPF–deficient human cells restored nucleotide excision repair of UV–induced DNA damage. Intriguingly, in all XPF mutant cell lines examined, XPF-ERCC1 was detected in the cytoplasm of a fraction of cells. This demonstrates that at least part of the DNA repair defect and symptoms associated with mutations in XPF are due to mislocalization of XPF-ERCC1 into the cytoplasm of cells, likely due to protein misfolding. Analysis of these patient cells therefore reveals a novel mechanism to potentially regulate a cell's capacity for DNA repair: by manipulating nuclear localization of XPF-ERCC1.
","XPF-ERCC1 is a nuclease that plays a critical role in DNA repair. Mutations in XPF are linked to xeroderma pigmentosum, characterized by sun sensitivity, high incidence of skin cancer, and neurodegeneration, or XFE progeroid syndrome, a disease of accelerated aging. Herein we report the unexpected finding that mutations in XPF cause mislocalization of XPF-ERCC1 to the cytoplasm. Recombinant mutant XPF-ERCC1 derived from XP– and XFE–causing alleles are catalytically active and if delivered to the nucleus of cells restore DNA repair. This demonstrates that protein mislocalization contributes to defective DNA repair and disease arising as a consequence of mutations in XPF. It also illustrates a novel mechanism of regulating a cell's capacity for DNA repair: by manipulating nuclear localization of XPF-ERCC1 to enhance or inhibit repair and to prevent cancer or tumor resistance to chemotherapy, respectively.

"Because coevolution takes place across a broad scale of time and space, it is virtually impossible to understand its dynamics and trajectories by studying a single pair of interacting populations at one time. Comparing populations across a range of an interaction, especially for long-lived species, can provide insight into these features of coevolution by sampling across a diverse set of conditions and histories. We used measures of prey traits (tetrodotoxin toxicity in newts) and predator traits (tetrodotoxin resistance of snakes) to assess the degree of phenotypic mismatch across the range of their coevolutionary interaction. Geographic patterns of phenotypic exaggeration were similar in prey and predators, with most phenotypically elevated localities occurring along the central Oregon coast and central California. Contrary to expectations, however, these areas of elevated traits did not coincide with the most intense coevolutionary selection. Measures of functional trait mismatch revealed that over one-third of sampled localities were so mismatched that reciprocal selection could not occur given current trait distributions. Estimates of current locality-specific interaction selection gradients confirmed this interpretation. In every case of mismatch, predators were “ahead” of prey in the arms race; the converse escape of prey was never observed. The emergent pattern suggests a dynamic in which interacting species experience reciprocal selection that drives arms-race escalation of both prey and predator phenotypes at a subset of localities across the interaction. This coadaptation proceeds until the evolution of extreme phenotypes by predators, through genes of large effect, allows snakes to, at least temporarily, escape the arms race.
","Arms races between natural enemies can lead to the rapid evolution of extreme traits, high degrees of specialization, and the formation of new species. They also serve as the ecological model for the evolution of drug resistance by diseases and for host–pathogen interactions in general. Revealing who wins these arms races and how they do so is critical to our understanding of these processes. Capitalizing on the geographic mosaic of species interactions, we examined the dynamics of the arms race between snakes and their toxic newt prey. Garter snakes in some populations have evolved dramatic resistance to the tetrodotoxin defense of the their local prey. By evaluating the pattern of mismatches between toxicity and resistance, we discovered that predators sometimes escape the arms race through the evolution of extreme resistance, but that prey never come out ahead. The reason for this one-sided outcome appears to depend on the molecular genetic basis of resistance in snakes, wherein changes to a single amino acid residue can confer huge differences in resistance.

"To identify the genes required to sustain aneuploid viability, we screened a deletion library of non-essential genes in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which most types of aneuploidy are eventually lethal to the cell. Aneuploids remain viable for a period of time and can form colonies by reducing the extent of the aneuploidy. We hypothesized that a reduction in colony formation efficiency could be used to screen for gene deletions that compromise aneuploid viability. Deletion mutants were used to measure the effects on the viability of spores derived from triploid meiosis and from a chromosome instability mutant. We found that the CCR4-NOT complex, an evolutionarily conserved general regulator of mRNA turnover, and other related factors, including poly(A)-specific nuclease for mRNA decay, are involved in aneuploid viability. Defective mutations in CCR4-NOT complex components in the distantly related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affected the viability of spores produced from triploid cells, suggesting that this complex has a conserved role in aneuploids. In addition, our findings suggest that the genes required for homologous recombination repair are important for aneuploid viability.
","Aneuploidy is a major cause of abortive development and is implicated in tumorigenesis in humans. Recent studies revealed that the increased need for protein degradation might account for the detrimental effects of aneuploidy on a cell. Here, we investigated the genetic systems responsible for aneuploid viability. Using a collection of gene deletions in fission yeast, we isolated mutants that affect aneuploid viability. We found that an evolutionarily conserved transcription regulator, the CCR4-NOT complex, and its related factors are required for aneuploid viability, suggesting that regulation of mRNA turnover is required to tolerate aneuploidy. In addition, homologous recombination repair is important for aneuploid viability.

"The ribosome is critical for all aspects of cell growth due to its essential role in protein synthesis. Paradoxically, many Ribosomal proteins (Rps) act as tumour suppressors in Drosophila and vertebrates. To examine how reductions in Rps could lead to tissue overgrowth, we took advantage of the observation that an RpS6 mutant dominantly suppresses the small rough eye phenotype in a cyclin E hypomorphic mutant (cycEJP). We demonstrated that the suppression of cycEJP by the RpS6 mutant is not a consequence of restoring CycE protein levels or activity in the eye imaginal tissue. Rather, the use of UAS-RpS6 RNAi transgenics revealed that the suppression of cycEJP is exerted via a mechanism extrinsic to the eye, whereby reduced Rp levels in the prothoracic gland decreases the activity of ecdysone, the steroid hormone, delaying developmental timing and hence allowing time for tissue and organ overgrowth. These data provide for the first time a rationale to explain the counter-intuitive organ overgrowth phenotypes observed for certain members of the Minute class of Drosophila Rp mutants. They also demonstrate how Rp mutants can affect growth and development cell non-autonomously.
","Ribosomes are required for protein synthesis, which is essential for cell growth and division, thus mutations that reduce Rp expression would be expected to limit cell growth. Paradoxically, heterozygous deletion or mutation of certain Rps can actually promote growth and proliferation and in some cases bestow predisposition to cancer. The underlying mechanism(s) behind these unexpected overgrowth phenotypes despite impairment of ribosome biogenesis has remained obscure. We have addressed this question using the power of Drosophila genetics, taking advantage of our observation that four different Rp mutants, or Minutes, are able to suppress a small rough eye phenotype associated with a mutation of the essential controller of cell proliferation cyclin E (cycEJP). Our findings demonstrate that suppression of cycEJP by the RpS6 mutant is exerted via a tissue non-autonomous mechanism whereby reduced Rp in the prothoracic gland decreases activity of the steroid hormone ecdysone, delaying development and hence allowing time for compensatory growth. These data provide for the first time a rationale to explain the counter-intuitive organ overgrowth phenotypes observed for certain Drosophila Minutes. Our findings also have implications for the effect of Rp mutants on endocrine related control of tissue growth in higher organisms.

"While Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is in decline on the continent of Africa, the disease still remains a major health problem in Uganda. There are recurrent sporadic outbreaks in the traditionally endemic areas in south-east Uganda, and continued spread to new unaffected areas in central Uganda. We evaluated the evolutionary dynamics underpinning the origin of new foci and the impact of host species on parasite genetic diversity in Uganda. We genotyped 269 Trypanosoma brucei isolates collected from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci, and checked for the presence of the SRA gene that confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesiense.
Both Bayesian clustering methods and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components partition Trypanosoma brucei isolates obtained from Uganda and southwestern Kenya into three distinct genetic clusters. Clusters 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These three clusters are not sorted by subspecies designation (T. b. brucei vs T. b. rhodesiense), host or date of collection. The analyses also show evidence of genetic admixture among the three genetic clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and possibly on-going gene flow between them.
Our results show that the expansion of the disease to the new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr). They also confirm the emergence of the human infective strains (Tbr) from non-infective T. b. brucei (Tbb) strains of different genetic backgrounds, and the importance of cattle as Tbr reservoir, as confounders that shape the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.

"Dominant mutations of Gata4, an essential cardiogenic transcription factor (TF), were known to cause outflow tract (OFT) defects in both human and mouse, but the underlying molecular mechanism was not clear. In this study, Gata4 haploinsufficiency in mice was found to result in OFT defects including double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and ventricular septum defects (VSDs). Gata4 was shown to be required for Hedgehog (Hh)-receiving progenitors within the second heart field (SHF) for normal OFT alignment. Restored cell proliferation in the SHF by knocking-down Pten failed to rescue OFT defects, suggesting that additional cell events under Gata4 regulation is important. SHF Hh-receiving cells failed to migrate properly into the proximal OFT cushion, which is associated with abnormal EMT and cell proliferation in Gata4 haploinsufficiency. The genetic interaction of Hh signaling and Gata4 is further demonstrated to be important for OFT development. Gata4 and Smo double heterozygotes displayed more severe OFT abnormalities including persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA). Restoration of Hedgehog signaling renormalized SHF cell proliferation and migration, and rescued OFT defects in Gata4 haploinsufficiency. In addition, there was enhanced Gata6 expression in the SHF of the Gata4 heterozygotes. The Gata4-responsive repressive sites were identified within 1kbp upstream of the transcription start site of Gata6 by both ChIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assay. These results suggested a SHF regulatory network comprising of Gata4, Gata6 and Hh-signaling for OFT development.
","Gata4 is an important transcription factor that regulates the development of the heart. Human possessing a single copy of Gata4 mutation display congenital heart defects (CHD), including double outlet right ventricle (DORV). DORV is an alignment problem in which both the Aorta and Pulmonary Artery originate from the right ventricle, instead of originating from the left and the right ventricles, respectively. In this study, a Gata4 mutant mouse model was used to study how Gata4 mutations cause DORV. We showed that Gata4 is required in the cardiac precursor cells for the normal alignment of the great arteries. Although Gata4 mutations inhibit the rapid increase in the cardiac precursor cell numbers, resolving this problem does not recover the normal alignment of the great arteries. It indicates that there is a migratory issue of the cardiac precursor cells as they navigate to the great arteries during development. The study further showed that a specific molecular signaling, Hh-signaling and Gata6 are responsible to the Gata4 action in the cardiac precursor cells. Importantly, over-activation of the Hh-signaling pathways rescues the DORV in the Gata4 mutant embryos. This study provides a molecular model to explain the ontogeny of a subtype of CHD.

"The debilitating skin disease Buruli ulcer (BU) is caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. While various hypotheses on potential reservoirs and vectors of M. ulcerans exist, the mode of transmission has remained unclear. Epidemiological studies have indicated that children below the age of four are less exposed to the pathogen and at lower risk of developing BU than older children. In the present study we compared the age at which children begin to develop antibody responses against M. ulcerans with the age pattern of responses to other pathogens transmitted by various mechanisms. A total of 1,352 sera from individuals living in the BU endemic Offin river valley of Ghana were included in the study. While first serological responses to the mosquito transmitted malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and to soil transmitted Strongyloides helminths emerged around the age of one and two years, sero-conversion for M. ulcerans and for the water transmitted trematode Schistosoma mansoni occurred at around four and five years, respectively. Our data suggest that exposure to M. ulcerans intensifies strongly at the age when children start to have more intense contact with the environment, outside the small movement range of young children. Further results from our serological investigations in the Offin river valley also indicate ongoing transmission of Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of yaws.
","Buruli ulcer is a debilitating skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. Although the understanding of this enigmatic pathogen has improved after decades of research, the mode of transmission is yet to be fully elucidated. Recent epidemiological studies have shown an underrepresentation of Buruli ulcer cases in children below the age of four as compared to older children. In order to investigate the different exposure of children to M. ulcerans and to several other pathogens with diverse modes of transmission, we conducted a sero-epidemiological study of 1,352 residents within a five kilometer radius along the Offin River of Ghana. While our results show early exposure of children to the mosquito transmitted malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum as well as to soil transmitted helminths of the genus Strongyloides, a later onset of immune response was observed at an age of around four and five years for M. ulcerans and the trematode Schistosoma mansoni, that is transmitted by contact with infested water. Similarities in age-dependent exposure of these two pathogens suggest that transmission may take place outside of the very young children’s movement range when they come into contact with the environment at the periphery of their villages.

"Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is a malformation of cortical development commonly associated with epilepsy. We exome sequenced 202 individuals with sporadic PVNH to identify novel genetic risk loci. We first performed a trio-based analysis and identified 219 de novo variants. Although no novel genes were implicated in this initial analysis, PVNH cases were found overall to have a significant excess of nonsynonymous de novo variants in intolerant genes (p = 3.27x10-7), suggesting a role for rare new alleles in genes yet to be associated with the condition. Using a gene-level collapsing analysis comparing cases and controls, we identified a genome-wide significant signal driven by four ultra-rare loss-of-function heterozygous variants in MAP1B, including one de novo variant. In at least one instance, the MAP1B variant was inherited from a parent with previously undiagnosed PVNH. The PVNH was frontally predominant and associated with perisylvian polymicrogyria. These results implicate MAP1B in PVNH. More broadly, our findings suggest that detrimental mutations likely arising in immediately preceding generations with incomplete penetrance may also be responsible for some apparently sporadic diseases.
","Almost 20 years ago the first gene responsible for periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), a disorder that leads to abnormal migration of neurons during fetal brain development, was discovered. Since that time additional genes have been identified, but collectively they only explain a minority of cases. In this work we sought to further elucidate the genetic basis of this disorder using exome sequencing of 202 individuals with PVNH. We found a clear role for de novo mutations in PVNH, although with this analysis alone we were unable to pinpoint which of the de novo mutations in novel genes caused the disease. One patient was found to have a de novo variant in MAP1B, a gene that encodes a protein that plays a role at several key steps of brain development. With further analysis of the exome sequence data we found an additional three cases with a very rare inherited variant in MAP1B. This pattern is not expected to occur by chance and therefore indicates that these variants are likely responsible for the PVNH in these patients. Further strengthing the association of MAP1B in PVNH, all of the patients with a MAP1B variant had a similar brain abnormality, and at least one of the parents who transmitted the variant to their child was also similarly affected. This work adds to a growing list of genes responsible for PVNH, illuminates new genes involved in brain development, and importantly informs us about the types of genetic variants involved in PVNH.

"Nanog is a principal pluripotency regulator exhibiting a disperse distribution within stem cell populations in vivo and in vitro. Increasing evidence points to a functional role of Nanog heterogeneity on stem cell fate decisions. Allelic control of Nanog gene expression was reported recently in mouse embryonic stem cells. To better understand how this mode of regulation influences the observed heterogeneity of NANOG in stem cell populations, we assembled a multiscale stochastic population balance equation framework. In addition to allelic control, gene expression noise and random partitioning at cell division were considered. As a result of allelic Nanog expression, the distribution of Nanog exhibited three distinct states but when combined with transcriptional noise the profile became bimodal. Regardless of their allelic expression pattern, initially uniform populations of stem cells gave rise to the same Nanog heterogeneity within ten cell cycles. Depletion of NANOG content in cells switching off both gene alleles was slower than the accumulation of intracellular NANOG after cells turned on at least one of their Nanog gene copies pointing to Nanog state-dependent dynamics. Allelic transcription of Nanog also raises issues regarding the use of stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in a single allelic locus. Indeed, significant divergence was observed in the reporter and native protein profiles depending on the difference in their half-lives and insertion of the reporter gene in one or both alleles. In stem cell populations with restricted Nanog expression, allelic regulation facilitates the maintenance of fractions of self-renewing cells with sufficient Nanog content to prevent aberrant loss of pluripotency. Our findings underline the role of allelic control of Nanog expression as a prime determinant of stem cell population heterogeneity and warrant further investigation in the contexts of stem cell specification and cell reprogramming.
","Nanog is a key factor influencing the decision of a stem cell to remain pluripotent or differentiate. Each embryonic stem cell (ESC) in a population exhibits fluctuating Nanog levels resulting in heterogeneity which affects cell fate specification. The allelic regulation of Nanog was demonstrated recently but its implications on population heterogeneity are unclear. We developed a multiscale population balance equation (PBE) model and compared our results with pertinent experimental studies. Under allelic control the profile of Nanog features three peaks or distinct states. Transcriptional noise causes the distribution to become bimodal as suggested previously. When stem cells carrying a reporter transgene in an allelically regulated locus were examined, we observed non-matching distributions of the endogenous and reporter proteins. This led us to investigate the performance of reporter systems depending on insertion of the transgene in one or both alleles and the protein degradation dynamics. Lastly, our model was employed to address how allelic regulation affects the maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells with a single Nanog allele deletion. A fraction of these cells remains pluripotent while deletion of a single allele does not simply reduce NANOG uniformly for all ESCs but modulates NANOG heterogeneity directly.

"Feedforward inhibition and synaptic scaling are important adaptive processes that control the total input a neuron can receive from its afferents. While often studied in isolation, the two have been reported to co-occur in various brain regions. The functional implications of their interactions remain unclear, however. Based on a probabilistic modeling approach, we show here that fast feedforward inhibition and synaptic scaling interact synergistically during unsupervised learning. In technical terms, we model the input to a neural circuit using a normalized mixture model with Poisson noise. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that, in the presence of lateral inhibition introducing competition between different neurons, Hebbian plasticity and synaptic scaling approximate the optimal maximum likelihood solutions for this model. Our results suggest that, beyond its conventional use as a mechanism to remove undesired pattern variations, input normalization can make typical neural interaction and learning rules optimal on the stimulus subspace defined through feedforward inhibition. Furthermore, learning within this subspace is more efficient in practice, as it helps avoid locally optimal solutions. Our results suggest a close connection between feedforward inhibition and synaptic scaling which may have important functional implications for general cortical processing.
","The inputs a neuron receives from its presynaptic partners strongly fluctuate as a result of either varying sensory information or ongoing intrinsic activity. To represent this wide range of signals effectively, neurons use various mechanisms that regulate the total input they receive. On the one hand, feedforward inhibition adjusts the relative contribution of individual inputs inversely proportional to the total number of active afferents, implementing a form of input normalization. On the other hand, synaptic scaling uniformly rescales the efficacy of incoming synapses to stabilize the neuron's firing rate after learning-induced changes in drive. Given that these mechanisms often act on the same neurons, we ask here if there are any benefits in combining the two. We show that the interaction between the two has important computational consequences, beyond their traditional role in maintaining network homeostasis. When combined with lateral inhibition, synaptic scaling and fast feedforward inhibition allow the circuit to learn efficiently from noisy, ambiguous inputs. For inputs not normalized by feed-forward inhibition, learning is less efficient. Given that feed-forward inhibition and synaptic scaling have been reported in various systems, our results suggest that they could generally facilitate learning in neural circuits. More broadly, our work emphasizes the importance of studying the interaction between different plasticity mechanisms for understanding circuit function.

"Eukaryotic genomes are regulated by epigenetic marks that act to modulate transcriptional control as well as to regulate DNA replication and repair. In Arabidopsis thaliana, mutation of the ATXR5 and ATXR6 histone methyltransferases causes reduction in histone H3 lysine 27 monomethylation, transcriptional upregulation of transposons, and a genome instability defect in which there is an accumulation of excess DNA corresponding to pericentromeric heterochromatin. We designed a forward genetic screen to identify suppressors of the atxr5/6 phenotype that uncovered loss-of-function mutations in two components of the TREX-2 complex (AtTHP1, AtSAC3B), a SUMO-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase (AtSTUbL2) and a methyl-binding domain protein (AtMBD9). Additionally, using a reverse genetic approach, we show that a mutation in a plant homolog of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 enhances the atxr5/6 phenotype. Through characterization of these mutations, our results suggest models for the production atxr5 atxr6-induced extra DNA involving conflicts between the replicative and transcriptional processes in the cell, and suggest that the atxr5 atxr6 transcriptional defects may be the cause of the genome instability defects in the mutants. These findings highlight the critical intersection of transcriptional silencing and DNA replication in the maintenance of genome stability of heterochromatin.
","In eukaryotic genomes cellular processes such as transcription and replication need to be tightly controlled in order to promote genomic stability and prevent deleterious mutations. In Arabidopsis thaliana, two redundant histone methyltransferases, ATXR5 and ATXR6, are responsible for the deposition of a silencing epigenetic mark, histone H3 lysine 27 monomethylation. Loss of ATXR5/6 results in transcriptional activation of transposable elements (TEs), upregulation of DNA damage response genes and a genomic instability defect characterized as an excess of DNA corresponding to heterochromatin regions. Using a genetic screen, we sought to find suppressors of the atxr5/6 phenotype, and interestingly, we identified multiple genes implicated in general transcriptional activity. Through genomic characterization of the mutants our data suggest a model where transcriptional silencing of heterochromatin during S-phase is required for proper replication and maintenance of genome stability. These findings emphasize the important relationship between chromatin, transcriptional control and replication in the maintenance of genome stability in a eukaryotic system and identify new players involved in these processes.

"Learning in biologically relevant neural-network models usually relies on Hebb learning rules. The typical implementations of these rules change the synaptic strength on the basis of the co-occurrence of the neural events taking place at a certain time in the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Differential Hebbian learning (DHL) rules, instead, are able to update the synapse by taking into account the temporal relation, captured with derivatives, between the neural events happening in the recent past. The few DHL rules proposed so far can update the synaptic weights only in few ways: this is a limitation for the study of dynamical neurons and neural-network models. Moreover, empirical evidence on brain spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shows that different neurons express a surprisingly rich repertoire of different learning processes going far beyond existing DHL rules. This opens up a second problem of how capturing such processes with DHL rules. Here we propose a general DHL (G-DHL) rule generating the existing rules and many others. The rule has a high expressiveness as it combines in different ways the pre- and post-synaptic neuron signals and derivatives. The rule flexibility is shown by applying it to various signals of artificial neurons and by fitting several different STDP experimental data sets. To these purposes, we propose techniques to pre-process the neural signals and capture the temporal relations between the neural events of interest. We also propose a procedure to automatically identify the rule components and parameters that best fit different STDP data sets, and show how the identified components might be used to heuristically guide the search of the biophysical mechanisms underlying STDP. Overall, the results show that the G-DHL rule represents a useful means to study time-sensitive learning processes in both artificial neural networks and brain.
","Which learning rules can be used to capture the temporal relations between activation events involving pairs of neurons in artificial neural networks? Previous computational research proposed various differential Hebbian learning (DHL) rules that rely on the activation of neurons and time derivatives of their activations to capture specific temporal relations between neural events. However, empirical research of brain plasticity, in particular plasticity depending on sequences of pairs of spikes involving the pre- and the post-synaptic neurons, i.e., spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), shows that the brain uses a surprisingly wide variety of different learning mechanisms that cannot be captured by the DHL rules proposed so far. Here we propose a general differential Hebbian learning (G-DHL) rule able to generate all existing DHL rules and many others. We show various examples of how the rule can be used to update the synapse in many different ways based on the temporal relation between neural events in pairs of artificial neurons. Moreover, we show the flexibility of the G-DHL rule by applying it to successfully fit several different STDP processes recorded in the brain. Overall, the G-DHL rule represents a new tool for conducting research on learning processes that depend on the timing of signal events.

"The catalytic subunit of yeast telomerase, Est2p, is a telomere associated throughout most of the cell cycle, while the Est1p subunit binds only in late S/G2 phase, the time of telomerase action. Est2p binding in G1/early S phase requires a specific interaction between telomerase RNA (TLC1) and Ku80p. Here, we show that in four telomerase-deficient strains (cdc13-2, est1Ä, tlc1-SD, and tlc1-BD), Est2p telomere binding was normal in G1/early S phase but reduced to about 40–50% of wild type levels in late S/G2 phase. Est1p telomere association was low in all four strains. Wild type levels of Est2p telomere binding in late S/G2 phase was Est1p-dependent and required that Est1p be both telomere-bound and associated with a stem-bulge region in TLC1 RNA. In three telomerase-deficient strains in which Est1p is not Est2p-associated (tlc1-SD, tlc1-BD, and est2Ä), Est1p was present at normal levels but its telomere binding was very low. When the G1/early S phase and the late S/G2 phase telomerase recruitment pathways were both disrupted, neither Est2p nor Est1p was telomere-associated. We conclude that reduced levels of Est2p and low Est1p telomere binding in late S/G2 phase correlated with an est phenotype, while a WT level of Est2p binding in G1 was not sufficient to maintain telomeres. In addition, even though Cdc13p and Est1p interact by two hybrid, biochemical and genetic criteria, this interaction did not occur unless Est1p was Est2p-associated, suggesting that Est1p comes to the telomere only as part of the holoenzyme. Finally, the G1 and late S/G2 phase pathways for telomerase recruitment are distinct and are likely the only ones that bring telomerase to telomeres in wild-type cells.
","Duplication of linear DNA is complicated by the fact that conventional DNA polymerases cannot copy their ends. From yeasts to humans, replication of DNA ends, called telomeres, is accomplished by a telomere-dedicated reverse transcriptase called telomerase that uses its RNA subunit as a template. We show that there are two genetically distinct pathways that recruit yeast telomerase, Est2p, to telomeres in a cell cycle–dependent manner. Only one of the two pathways, the pathway operating late in the cell cycle, is required for telomere maintenance. In telomerase-deficient strains, the amount of Est2p that is telomere-bound late in the cell cycle is about 50% of wild type levels. Maintenance of functional levels of Est2p late in the cell cycle requires that Est1p, another telomerase subunit, be telomere-bound. In addition, Est1p must be associated with Est2p via an interaction between it and telomerase RNA. Human telomerase is not active in most somatic cells, but is critical for stem cell longevity. Even a modest reduction in telomerase has a serious impact on human health. The sensitivity of yeast to reduced levels of telomere-associated telomerase may help us understand why human stem cells require high levels of telomerase for their survival.

"Identifying small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by selectively stalling the ribosome constitutes a new strategy for therapeutic development. Compounds that inhibit the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been identified that reduce LDL cholesterol in preclinical models and that affect the translation of only a few off-target proteins. Although some of these compounds hold potential for future therapeutic development, it is not known how they impact the physiology of cells or ribosome quality control pathways. Here we used a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of a selective PCSK9 translational inhibitor, PF-06378503 (PF8503). The two most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF8503, the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3, bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Surprisingly, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. In genetic interaction experiments, ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2, and functions downstream of HBS1L. Taken together, these results identify new connections between ribosome quality control pathways, and provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation that will aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease.
","A fundamentally new approach to treat human diseases caused by “undruggable” proteins would be to use small molecules to selectively inhibit their synthesis by the ribosome. Here we compare two related compounds (PF846, PF8503) that selectively stall human translation to the effects of a more general translation inhibitor, homoharringtonin. We used genome-wide approaches to probe the effects of these compounds, including measurements of which messenger RNAs are being translated and the effects of knocking down gene expression on cell growth. These experiments revealed new and surprising genetic connections between ribosome quality control pathways. We then used biochemical and cell-based experiments to test the involvement of particular ribosome quality control proteins such as ASCC2, ASCC3 and HBS1L in the physiological response of cells to translation inhibitors. The genetic and biochemical insights presented here should aid the development of next-generation selective translation inhibitors to treat disease.

"Reduced insulin/IGF signaling increases lifespan in many animals. To understand how insulin/IGF mediates lifespan in Drosophila, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis with the insulin/IGF regulated transcription factor dFOXO in long-lived insulin/IGF signaling genotypes. Dawdle, an Activin ligand, is bound and repressed by dFOXO when reduced insulin/IGF extends lifespan. Reduced Activin signaling improves performance and protein homeostasis in muscles of aged flies. Activin signaling through the Smad binding element inhibits the transcription of Autophagy-specific gene 8a (Atg8a) within muscle, a factor controlling the rate of autophagy. Expression of Atg8a within muscle is sufficient to increase lifespan. These data reveal how insulin signaling can regulate aging through control of Activin signaling that in turn controls autophagy, representing a potentially conserved molecular basis for longevity assurance. While reduced Activin within muscle autonomously retards functional aging of this tissue, these effects in muscle also reduce secretion of insulin-like peptides at a distance from the brain. Reduced insulin secretion from the brain may subsequently reinforce longevity assurance through decreased systemic insulin/IGF signaling.
","It is widely known that reduced insulin/IGF signaling slows aging in many contexts. This process requires the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO). FOXO modulates the expression of many genes, and the list of those associated with slow aging is impressive. But there are few data indicating the mechanisms or genes through which FOXO actually slows aging. Here, we identify a novel FOXO target, dawdle, the Activin-like ligand in fruit flies. We show that down-regulation of Activin signaling in muscle, but not in adipose tissue, leads to extended lifespan. In part it does so when it alleviates the negative transcriptional repression of its Smox transcription factor (a Smad transcription factor) upon a keystone autophagy gene, Atg8a. This double signaling cascade autonomously improves muscle performance (measured at cellular and functional levels) and nonautonomously extends lifespan as it reduces the secretion of insulin peptides from the brain. The work develops the emerging model for interacting autonomous-nonautonomous roles of insulin/IGF signaling as a systems integrative mechanism of aging control.

"Modeling the transport, activation, and adhesion of platelets is crucial in predicting thrombus formation and growth following a thrombotic event in normal or pathological conditions. We propose a shear-dependent platelet adhesive model based on the Morse potential that is calibrated by existing in vivo and in vitro experimental data and can be used over a wide range of flow shear rates (100 < γ ˙ < 28 , 000 s - 1). We introduce an Eulerian-Lagrangian model where hemodynamics is solved on a fixed Eulerian grid, while platelets are tracked using a Lagrangian framework. A force coupling method is introduced for bidirectional coupling of platelet motion with blood flow. Further, we couple the calibrated platelet aggregation model with a tissue-factor/contact pathway coagulation cascade, representing the relevant biology of thrombin generation and the subsequent fibrin deposition. The range of shear rates covered by the proposed model encompass venous and arterial thrombosis, ranging from low-shear-rate conditions in abdominal aortic aneurysms and thoracic aortic dissections to thrombosis in stenotic arteries following plaque rupture, where local shear rates are extremely high.
","Hemostasis (thrombus formation) is the normal physiological response that prevents significant blood loss after vascular injury. The resulting clots can form under different flow conditions in the veins as well as the arteries. The excessive and undesirable formation of clots (i.e., thrombosis) in our circulatory system may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Some of these pathologies are deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and atherothrombosis (thrombosis triggered by plaque rupture) in coronary arteries, to name a few. The process of clot formation and growth at a site on a blood vessel wall involves a number of simultaneous processes including: multiple chemical reactions in the coagulation cascade, species transport and platelet adhesion all of which are strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic forces. Numerical models for blood clotting normally focus on one of the processes under a specific flow condition. Here, we propose a general numerical model that encompass a wide range of hemodynamic conditions in the veins and arteries, with individual platelets and their adhesive dynamics included explicitly in the models. Further, we include the biochemistry of coagulation cascade, which is essential to modeling thrombus formation, and couple that to our platelet aggregation model. The simulation results—tested against three different experiments—demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in capturing the in vivo and in vitro experimental observations.

"Influenza viruses present major challenges to public health, evident by the 2009 influenza pandemic. Highly pathogenic influenza virus infections generally coincide with early, high levels of inflammatory cytokines that some studies have suggested may be regulated in a strain-dependent manner. However, a comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamics of the inflammatory response induced by virulent influenza strains is lacking. Here, we applied gene co-expression and nonlinear regression analysis to time-course, microarray data developed from influenza-infected mouse lung to create mathematical models of the host inflammatory response. We found that the dynamics of inflammation-associated gene expression are regulated by an ultrasensitive-like mechanism in which low levels of virus induce minimal gene expression but expression is strongly induced once a threshold virus titer is exceeded. Cytokine assays confirmed that the production of several key inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, exhibit ultrasensitive behavior. A systematic exploration of the pathways regulating the inflammatory-associated gene response suggests that the molecular origins of this ultrasensitive response mechanism lie within the branch of the Toll-like receptor pathway that regulates STAT1 phosphorylation. This study provides the first evidence of an ultrasensitive mechanism regulating influenza virus-induced inflammation in whole lungs and provides insight into how different virus strains can induce distinct temporal inflammation response profiles. The approach developed here should facilitate the construction of gene regulatory models of other infectious diseases.
","Vaccines suffice for protecting public health against seasonal influenza viruses, but when unexpected strains appear against which the vaccine does not confer protection, alternative treatments are necessary. In this work, we used gene expression and virus growth data from influenza-infected mice to determine how moderate and deadly influenza viruses may invoke unique inflammatory responses and the role these responses play in disease pathology. We found that the relationship between virus growth and the inflammatory response for all viruses tested can be characterized by ultrasensitive response in which the inflammatory response is gated until a threshold concentration of virus is exceeded in the lung after which strong inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production occurs. This finding challenges the notion that deadly influenza viruses invoke unique cytokine and inflammatory responses and provides additional evidence that pathology is regulated by virus load, albeit in a highly nonlinear fashion. These findings suggests immunomodulatory treatments could focus on altering inflammatory response dynamics to improve disease pathology.

"In eukaryotes, RNA processing events in the nucleus influence the fate of transcripts in the cytoplasm. The multi-protein exon junction complex (EJC) associates with mRNAs concomitant with splicing in the nucleus and plays important roles in export, translation, surveillance and localization of mRNAs in the cytoplasm. In mammalian cells, the ribosome associated protein PYM (HsPYM) binds the Y14-Mago heterodimer moiety of the EJC core, and disassembles EJCs, presumably during the pioneer round of translation. However, the significance of the association of the EJC with mRNAs in a physiological context has not been tested and the function of PYM in vivo remains unknown. Here we address PYM function in Drosophila, where the EJC core proteins are genetically required for oskar mRNA localization during oogenesis. We provide evidence that the EJC binds oskar mRNA in vivo. Using an in vivo transgenic approach, we show that elevated amounts of the Drosophila PYM (DmPYM) N-terminus during oogenesis cause dissociation of EJCs from oskar RNA, resulting in its mislocalization and consequent female sterility. We find that, in contrast to HsPYM, DmPYM does not interact with the small ribosomal subunit and dismantles EJCs in a translation-independent manner upon over-expression. Biochemical analysis shows that formation of the PYM-Y14-Mago ternary complex is modulated by the PYM C-terminus revealing that DmPYM function is regulated in vivo. Furthermore, we find that whereas under normal conditions DmPYM is dispensable, its loss of function is lethal to flies with reduced y14 or mago gene dosage. Our analysis demonstrates that the amount of DmPYM relative to the EJC proteins is critical for viability and fertility. This, together with the fact that the EJC-disassembly activity of DmPYM is regulated, implicates PYM as an effector of EJC homeostasis in vivo.
","The multi-protein exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited at exon-exon junctions on mRNAs upon splicing. EJCs, with Y14, Mago, eIF4AIII and Barentsz proteins at their core, are landmarks of the nuclear history of RNAs and play important roles in their post-transcriptional regulation. In mammalian cells, the Y14-Mago interacting protein PYM associates with ribosomes and disassembles EJCs in the cytoplasm. However, the physiological function of PYM and its regulation in vivo remains unknown. We have analysed PYM function during Drosophila oogenesis, where the EJC is essential for oskar mRNA localization in the oocyte, a prerequisite for embryonic patterning and germline formation. We find that Drosophila PYM interacts with Y14-Mago but, in contrast to mammalian PYM, does not bind ribosomes. We demonstrate that EJCs associated with oskar mRNA in vivo are disassembled by PYM over-expression in a translation-independent manner, causing oskar mislocalization. Our in vivo analysis shows that the Drosophila PYM C-terminal domain modulates PYM-Y14-Mago interaction, revealing that PYM is regulated in Drosophila. Furthermore, PYM is essential for viability of flies lacking one functional copy of y14 or mago, supporting a role of PYM in EJC homeostasis. Our results highlight a distinct mode of regulation of the EJC-dissociating protein PYM in Drosophila.

"Cellular junctions are crucial for the formation of multicellular organisms, where they anchor cells to each other and/or supportive tissue and enable cell-to-cell communication. Some unicellular organisms, such as the parasitic protist Trypanosoma brucei, also have complex cellular junctions. The flagella connector (FC) is a three-layered transmembrane junction that moves with the growing tip of a new flagellum and attaches it to the side of the old flagellum. The FC moves via an unknown molecular mechanism, independent of new flagellum growth. Here we describe the detailed 3D architecture of the FC suggesting explanations for how it functions and its mechanism of motility.
We have used a combination of electron tomography and cryo-electron tomography to reveal the 3D architecture of the FC. Cryo-electron tomography revealed layers of repetitive filamentous electron densities between the two flagella in the interstitial zone. Though the FC does not change in length and width during the growth of the new flagellum, the interstitial zone thickness decreases as the FC matures. This investigation also shows interactions between the FC layers and the axonemes of the new and old flagellum, sufficiently strong to displace the axoneme in the old flagellum. We describe a novel filament, the flagella connector fibre, found between the FC and the axoneme in the old flagellum.
The FC is similar to other cellular junctions in that filamentous proteins bridge the extracellular space and are anchored to underlying cytoskeletal structures; however, it is built between different portions of the same cell and is unique because of its intrinsic motility. The detailed description of its structure will be an important tool to use in attributing structure / function relationships as its molecular components are discovered in the future. The FC is involved in the inheritance of cell shape, which is important for the life cycle of this human parasite.
","Trypanosoma brucei is an uni-cellular parasite transmitted to humans and cattle by the bloodsucking tsetse fly. Once swimming in the mammalian bloodstream, it causes the devastating African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. During its complex life cycle, it undergoes many cell shape changes, which are important for efficient parasite transmission. Here, we have studied a cell structure intrinsically involved in shape acquisition during division of the T. brucei life cycle form that multiplies in the fly midgut. Using electron tomography we show the 3D architecture of a motile cellular junction that slides with the tip of the growing new flagellum along the side of the old flagellum. This enables the new flagellum to zip in to the cell body structure alongside the old flagellum after which the cleavage furrow is established between these two flagella, producing two daughter cells of similar cell shape. We present here a detailed architectural overview of this junction; we show that it matures with time and pushes the old flagellum’s axoneme sideways as it passes. This structural map enables insight into the function of this extraordinary mobile cellular junction.

"Linker histones are essential components of chromatin, but the distributions and functions of many during cellular differentiation are not well understood. Here, we show that H1.5 binds to genic and intergenic regions, forming blocks of enrichment, in differentiated human cells from all three embryonic germ layers but not in embryonic stem cells. In differentiated cells, H1.5, but not H1.3, binds preferentially to genes that encode membrane and membrane-related proteins. Strikingly, 37% of H1.5 target genes belong to gene family clusters, groups of homologous genes that are located in proximity to each other on chromosomes. H1.5 binding is associated with gene repression and is required for SIRT1 binding, H3K9me2 enrichment, and chromatin compaction. Depletion of H1.5 results in loss of SIRT1 and H3K9me2, increased chromatin accessibility, deregulation of gene expression, and decreased cell growth. Our data reveal for the first time a specific and novel function for linker histone subtype H1.5 in maintenance of condensed chromatin at defined gene families in differentiated human cells.
","In human cells, there are eleven subtypes of linker histones, five (H1.1–H1.5) of which are ubiquitously expressed in somatic cells. Somatic linker histones have been thought of as a group of similar proteins with redundant functions with few known differences among them. Our work uncovers for the first time a novel and unique role for the linker histone H1.5 (HIST1H1B). We found that H1.5, but not H1.3 (HIST1H1D), forms blocks of chromatin binding in genic and intergenic regions in differentiated human cells from all germ layers but not in embryonic stem cells. In genic regions, H1.5 binds to a large fraction of gene families that encode membrane associated proteins and are transcriptionally silent in a tissue-specific manner. H1.5 binding is associated with other repressive chromatin elements such as SIRT1 binding and H3K9me2 enrichment, and it negatively correlates with Pol II distribution. SIRT1 and H3K9me2 binding is dependent on H1.5, but not vice versa. H1.5 depletion in fibroblasts leads to increased chromatin accessibility at its target loci, altered cell cycle, and deregulation of gene expression. Our findings show that H1.5 has a dynamic distribution during human cell differentiation and is required for maintenance of proper gene expression in differentiated cells.

"Down syndrome (DS), with trisomy of chromosome 21 (HSA21), is the commonest human aneuploidy. Pre-leukemic myeloproliferative changes in DS foetal livers precede the acquisition of GATA1 mutations, transient myeloproliferative disorder (DS-TMD) and acute megakaryocytic leukemia (DS-AMKL). Trisomy of the Erg gene is required for myeloproliferation in the Ts(1716)65Dn DS mouse model. We demonstrate here that genetic changes specifically attributable to trisomy of Erg lead to lineage priming of primitive and early multipotential progenitor cells in Ts(1716)65Dn mice, excess megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors, and malignant myeloproliferation. Gene expression changes dependent on trisomy of Erg in Ts(1716)65Dn multilineage progenitor cells were correlated with those associated with trisomy of HSA21 in human DS hematopoietic stem and primitive progenitor cells. These data suggest a role for ERG as a regulator of hematopoietic lineage potential, and that trisomy of ERG in the context of DS foetal liver hemopoiesis drives the pre-leukemic changes that predispose to subsequent DS-TMD and DS-AMKL.
","An excess number of genes in trisomy on human chromosome 21 leads to the development of specific diseases in human Down syndrome. An excess copy of the gene, ERG, an ETS family transcription factor, has been implicated in abnormal blood system development in Down syndrome. In this study we show how trisomy of Erg in a murine Down syndrome model perturbs hematopoietic progenitor cells in a manner similar to that observed in human Down syndrome by inducing gene expression changes and lineage priming in early multi-potential progenitors. We show that the gene expression signature specifically attributable to trisomy of Erg in the murine model is strongly correlated with gene expression changes in human Down syndrome hematopoietic cells. The data suggest that Erg is an important regulator of megakaryocyte-erythroid lineage specification in multipotential hematopoietic cells and that trisomy of Erg in the context of DS prediposes to a transient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryocyte leukaemia in a multi-step model of leukemogenesis.

"Why is spatial tuning in auditory cortex weak, even though location is important to object recognition in natural settings? This question continues to vex neuroscientists focused on linking physiological results to auditory perception. Here we show that the spatial locations of simultaneous, competing sound sources dramatically influence how well neural spike trains recorded from the zebra finch field L (an analog of mammalian primary auditory cortex) encode source identity. We find that the location of a birdsong played in quiet has little effect on the fidelity of the neural encoding of the song. However, when the song is presented along with a masker, spatial effects are pronounced. For each spatial configuration, a subset of neurons encodes song identity more robustly than others. As a result, competing sources from different locations dominate responses of different neural subpopulations, helping to separate neural responses into independent representations. These results help elucidate how cortical processing exploits spatial information to provide a substrate for selective spatial auditory attention.
","When a listener is presented with many sound sources at once, it is easier to understand a particular source when it comes from a different spatial location than the other competing sources. However, past studies of auditory cortex generally find that in response to a single sound source, there is not a precise representation of spatial location in the cortex, which makes this effect of spatial location hard to understand. Here, we presented zebra finches with two simultaneous sounds (a birdsong target and a noise masking sound) from distinct spatial locations and recorded neural responses in field L, which is analogous to primary auditory cortex in mammals. When the target sound was presented by itself, the location of the source had little effect on the ability to identify the target song based on neural activity in field L. However, when the target was presented with a masker sound, the location of both sources strongly affected neural discrimination performance. Moreover, different subpopulations of neurons preferentially encoded either target or masker, providing a potential substrate for spatial selective attention. Thus, even though location is not well coded in cortical neurons, spatial information strongly modulates cortical responses.

"In the last decade, bacterial symbionts have been shown to play an important role in protecting hosts against pathogens. Wolbachia, a widespread symbiont in arthropods, can protect Drosophila and mosquito species against viral infections. We have investigated antiviral protection in 19 Wolbachia strains originating from 16 Drosophila species after transfer into the same genotype of Drosophila simulans. We found that approximately half of the strains protected against two RNA viruses. Given that 40% of terrestrial arthropod species are estimated to harbour Wolbachia, as many as a fifth of all arthropods species may benefit from Wolbachia-mediated protection. The level of protection against two distantly related RNA viruses – DCV and FHV – was strongly genetically correlated, which suggests that there is a single mechanism of protection with broad specificity. Furthermore, Wolbachia is making flies resistant to viruses, as increases in survival can be largely explained by reductions in viral titer. Variation in the level of antiviral protection provided by different Wolbachia strains is strongly genetically correlated to the density of the bacteria strains in host tissues. We found no support for two previously proposed mechanisms of Wolbachia-mediated protection — activation of the immune system and upregulation of the methyltransferase Dnmt2. The large variation in Wolbachia's antiviral properties highlights the need to carefully select Wolbachia strains introduced into mosquito populations to prevent the transmission of arboviruses.
","In recent years it has been discovered that many organisms are infected with bacterial symbionts that protect them against pathogens. Wolbachia is a bacterial symbiont that is found in many species of insects, and several strains are known to protect the insects against viral infection. We took 19 strains of Wolbachia from different species of Drosophila fruit flies, transferred them into Drosophila simulans, and then infected these flies with two different viruses. We found that about half of the strains slowed the death of flies after viral infection. Given that 40% of terrestrial arthropods may be infected with Wolbachia, this suggests that many species may benefit from this protection. These increases in survival were tightly linked to reductions in the levels of the virus in the insect, suggesting that Wolbachia is reducing the viruses' ability to replicate. Despite the two viruses we used being very different, the level of protection that a Wolbachia strain provided against the two viruses tended to be very similar, suggesting that a single general mechanism underlies the antiviral effects. The extent to which a Wolbachia strain provides protection against viral infection depends largely on the bacterial density— the more Wolbachia, the greater the protection.

"Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient that is not readily available to pathogens during infection due to an active host defense mechanism known as nutritional immunity. To overcome this nutrient restriction, bacteria utilize high-affinity transporters that allow them to compete with host metal-binding proteins. Despite the established role of Mn in bacterial pathogenesis, little is known about the relevance of Mn in the pathophysiology of E. faecalis. Here, we identified and characterized the major Mn acquisition systems of E. faecalis. We discovered that the ABC-type permease EfaCBA and two Nramp-type transporters, named MntH1 and MntH2, work collectively to promote cell growth under Mn-restricted conditions. The simultaneous inactivation of EfaCBA, MntH1 and MntH2 (ΔefaΔmntH1ΔmntH2 strain) led to drastic reductions (>95%) in cellular Mn content, severe growth defects in body fluids (serum and urine) ex vivo, significant loss of virulence in Galleria mellonella, and virtually complete loss of virulence in rabbit endocarditis and murine catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) models. Despite the functional redundancy of EfaCBA, MntH1 and MntH2 under in vitro or ex vivo conditions and in the invertebrate model, dual inactivation of efaCBA and mntH2 (ΔefaΔmntH2 strain) was sufficient to prompt maximal sensitivity to calprotectin, a Mn- and Zn-chelating host antimicrobial protein, and for the loss of virulence in mammalian models. Interestingly, EfaCBA appears to play a prominent role during systemic infection, whereas MntH2 was more important during CAUTI. The different roles of EfaCBA and MntH2 in these sites could be attributed, at least in part, to the differential expression of efaA and mntH2 in cells isolated from hearts or from bladders. Collectively, this study demonstrates that Mn acquisition is essential for the pathogenesis of E. faecalis and validates Mn uptake systems as promising targets for the development of new antimicrobials.
","Enterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections that are often difficult to treat due to their exceptional multidrug resistance. Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient for bacterial pathogens during infection. To prevent infection, the host limits Mn bioavailability to invading bacteria in an active process known as nutritional immunity. To overcome this limitation, bacteria produce high-affinity Mn uptake systems to scavenge Mn from host tissues. Here, we identified the main Mn transporters of E. faecalis and show that, by working collectively, they are essential for growth of this opportunistic pathogen in Mn-restricted environments. Notably, the inability to acquire Mn during infection rendered E. faecalis virtually avirulent in different animal models, thereby revealing the essentiality of Mn acquisition to enterococcal pathogenesis. The results reported here highlight that bacterial Mn transport systems are promising targets for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies, which are expected to be particularly powerful to combat enterococcal infections.

"BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is an emerging pathogen whose reactivation causes severe disease in transplant patients. Unfortunately, there is no specific anti-BKPyV treatment available, and host cell components that affect the infection outcome are not well characterized. In this report, we examined the relationship between BKPyV productive infection and the activation of the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) in natural host cells. Our results showed that both the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)- and ATM and Rad-3-related (ATR)-mediated DDR were activated during BKPyV infection, accompanied by the accumulation of polyploid cells. We assessed the involvement of ATM and ATR during infection using small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdowns. ATM knockdown did not significantly affect viral gene expression, but reduced BKPyV DNA replication and infectious progeny production. ATR knockdown had a slightly more dramatic effect on viral T antigen (TAg) and its modified forms, DNA replication, and progeny production. ATM and ATR double knockdown had an additive effect on DNA replication and resulted in a severe reduction in viral titer. While ATM mainly led to the activation of pChk2 and ATR was primarily responsible for the activation of pChk1, knockdown of all three major phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs) did not abolish the activation of γH2AX during BKPyV infection. Finally, in the absence of ATM or ATR, BKPyV infection caused severe DNA damage and aberrant TAg staining patterns. These results indicate that induction of the DDR by BKPyV is critical for productive infection, and that one of the functions of the DDR is to minimize the DNA damage which is generated during BKPyV infection.
","BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a human pathogen that establishes a persistent sub-clinical infection in healthy humans. When patients are immunosuppressed, particularly in kidney and bone marrow transplantation, the virus can reactivate and result in severe disease. BKPyV-related disease has risen due to the use of newer immunosuppressive regimens and an increase in the number of transplants performed each year. We are interested in understanding the interactions between BKPyV and host cell components or pathways, with the aim of developing more BKPyV-specific antiviral treatment options. In this study we characterized the relationship between BKPyV infection and the cellular DNA damage response (DDR), a signaling cascade that is initiated by cells to repair damaged DNA molecules. Our study indicated that BKPyV activates and hijacks the DDR to facilitate its infection and that various components of the DDR may play distinct roles during this process. These data suggest that the DDR may provide a potential host target to control BKPyV reactivation in transplant recipients.

"Cell size scales with ploidy in a great range of eukaryotes, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using various orthogonal single-cell approaches, we show that cell size increases linearly with centromere (CEN) copy number in budding yeast. This effect is due to a G1 delay mediated by increased degradation of Cln3, the most upstream G1 cyclin acting at Start, and specific centromeric signaling proteins, namely Mad3 and Bub3. Mad3 binds both Cln3 and Cdc4, the adaptor component of the Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF) complex that targets Cln3 for degradation, these interactions being essential for the CEN-dosage dependent effects on cell size. Our results reveal a pathway that modulates cell size as a function of CEN number, and we speculate that, in cooperation with other CEN-independent mechanisms, it could assist the cell to attain efficient mass/ploidy ratios.
","It has been known for a long time that cells increase their size with the amount of DNA across the whole evolutionary scale. Moreover, within a given species and differentiation status, cells increase their size in an exquisitely proportional manner to the number of chromosomes. This correlation has been observed in fungi, plants, and animals, and it is assumed to have important implications in development and physiology. However, the molecular mechanisms that set cell size as a function of ploidy are still a mystery. Here, we uncover a pathway that links the number of chromosomes to the molecular network that triggers cell cycle entry in budding yeast. More specifically, we have found that an excess number of centromeres (CENs) increases degradation of Cln3, a G1 cyclin that plays a key role at Start, thus delaying entry into the cell cycle and, as cell growth is not affected, increasing cell size. Our results point to the existence of dedicated mechanisms operating during entry into the cell cycle to adjust cell size to ploidy.

"The innate immune system pattern recognition receptors (PRR) are the first line of host defenses recognizing the various pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns and eliciting defenses by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-18 or interferon β (IFN-β). NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and AIM2-like receptors (ALRs) are cytoplasmic inflammasome sensors of foreign molecules, including DNA. IFI16, a sequence-independent nuclear innate sensor ALR, recognizes episomal dsDNA genomes of herpes viruses such as KSHV, EBV, and HSV-1 in the infected cell nuclei, forms an inflammasome complex with ASC and procaspase1, and relocates into the cytoplasm leading into Caspase-1 and IL-1β generation. IFI16 also induces IFN-β during HSV-1 infection via the cytoplasmic STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway. Thus far, whether IFI16 recognizes foreign DNA directly or utilizes other host protein(s) is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that BRCA1, a DNA damage repair sensor and transcription regulator, is in complex with IFI16 in the host cell nucleus, and their association increases in the presence of nuclear viral genomes during de novo KSHV, EBV and HSV-1 infection, and in latent KSHV or EBV infection, but not by DNA damage responses (DDR) induced by bleomycin and vaccinia virus cytoplasmic dsDNA. BRCA1 is a constituent of the triggered IFI16-inflammasome and is translocated into the cytoplasm after genome recognition along with the IFI16-inflammasome. The absence of BRCA1 abrogated IFI16-viral genome association, inflammasome assembly, IFI16 cytoplasmic localization, and Caspase-1 and IL-1β production. The absence of BRCA1 also abolished the cytoplasmic IFI16-STING interaction, downstream IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of pIRF3 and IFN-β production during de novo KSHV and HSV-1 infection. These findings highlight that BRCA1 plays a hitherto unidentified innate immunomodulatory role by facilitating nuclear foreign DNA sensing by IFI16, subsequent assembly and cytoplasmic distribution of IFI16-inflammasomes leading into IL-1β formation and the induction of IFN-β via cytoplasmic signaling through IFI16-STING, TBK1 and IRF3.
","Invasion of a host cell by pathogens, including viruses, is sensed by pattern-recognition receptors resulting in the elicitation of the host innate defenses such as the formation of multi-protein inflammasome complexes, inflammatory IL-1β and IL-18 cytokine production and interferon-β production via the cytoplasmic STING molecule. We have shown that nuclear episomal viral DNA genomes of herpes viruses (KSHV, EBV and HSV-1) are sensed by the nuclear resident IFI16 protein, resulting in the formation of the IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome complex. Here, we show that BRCA1 promotes viral DNA sensing by IFI16 in the nucleus and is a constituent of the triggered IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome. IFI16 and BRCA1 are in complex in the nucleus and their association increases in the presence of KSHV, EBV or HSV-1 genomes, but not by the DNA damage response or vaccinia virus cytoplasmic dsDNA. The absence of BRCA1 results in abrogated IFI16-genome association, IFI16 cytoplasmic translocation, IL-1β production, IFI16 interaction with STING, IRF3 phosphorylation, pIRF3 nuclear translocation, and IFN-β induction. Taken together, these results demonstrate a crucial and novel role of BRCA1 in the innate sensing of viral DNA and subsequent induction of the inflammasome and interferon-β responses.

"The proteins involved in smooth muscle's molecular contractile mechanism – the anti-parallel motion of actin and myosin filaments driven by myosin heads interacting with actin – are found as different isoforms. While their expression levels are altered in disease states, their relevance to the mechanical interaction of myosin with actin is not sufficiently understood. Here, we analyzed in vitro actin filament propulsion by smooth muscle myosin for -actin (A), -actin-tropomyosin- (A-Tm), -actin-tropomyosin- (A-Tm), -actin (A), -actin-tropomyosin- (A-Tm), and -actin-tropomoysin- (A-Tm). Actin sliding analysis with our specifically developed video analysis software followed by statistical assessment (Bootstrapped Principal Component Analysis) indicated that the in vitro motility of A, A, and A-Tm is not distinguishable. Compared to these three ‘baseline conditions’, statistically significant differences () were: A-Tm – actin sliding velocity increased 1.12-fold, A-Tm – motile fraction decreased to 0.96-fold, stop time elevated 1.6-fold, A-Tm – run time elevated 1.7-fold. We constructed a mathematical model, simulated actin sliding data, and adjusted the kinetic parameters so as to mimic the experimentally observed differences: A-Tm – myosin binding to actin, the main, and the secondary myosin power stroke are accelerated, A-Tm – mechanical coupling between myosins is stronger, A-Tm – the secondary power stroke is decelerated and mechanical coupling between myosins is weaker. In summary, our results explain the different regulatory effects that specific combinations of actin and smooth muscle tropomyosin have on smooth muscle actin-myosin interaction kinetics.
","Dependent on the required physiological function, smooth muscle executes relatively fast contraction-relaxation cycles or maintains long-term contraction. The proteins driving contraction – amongst them actin, tropomyosin, and the contraction-driving myosin motor – can show small changes in the way they are constructed, they can be expressed as different “isoforms”. The isoforms are supposedly tailored to support the specific contraction patterns, but for tropomyosin and actin it is unclear exactly how the isoforms' differences affect the interaction of actin and myosin that generates the muscle contraction. We measured actin movement outside the cellular environment, focusing on the effects of different isoform combinations of only actin, myosin, and tropomyosin. We found that the actin isoforms cause differences in the mechanical interaction only when tropomyosin is present, not without it. Also, all different actin-tropomyosin combinations affected the mechanical interactions in a different way. In our experiments we could not directly observe the mechanical interactions of actin, tropomyosin, and myosin, so we reconstructed them in a mathematical model. With this model, we could determine in detail how the different actin-tropomyosin combinations caused the differences that we observed in our experiments.

"Polydnaviruses are mutualists of their parasitoid wasps and express genes in immune cells of their Lepidopteran hosts. Polydnaviral genomes carry multiple copies of viral ankyrins or vankyrins. Vankyrin proteins are homologous to IκB proteins, but lack sequences for regulated degradation. We tested if Ichnoviral Vankyrins differentially impede Toll-NF-κB-dependent hematopoietic and immune signaling in a heterologous in vivo Drosophila, system. We first show that hematopoiesis and the cellular encapsulation response against parasitoid wasps are tightly-linked via NF-κB signaling. The niche, which neighbors the larval hematopoietic progenitors, responds to parasite infection. Drosophila NF-κB proteins are expressed in the niche, and non cell-autonomously influence fate choice in basal and parasite-activated hematopoiesis. These effects are blocked by the Vankyrin I2-vank-3, but not by P-vank-1, as is the expression of a NF-κB target transgene. I2-vank-3 and P-vank-1 differentially obstruct cellular and humoral inflammation. Additionally, their maternal expression weakens ventral embryonic patterning. We propose that selective perturbation of NF-κB-IκB interactions in natural hosts of parasitic wasps negatively impacts the outcome of hematopoietic and immune signaling and this immune deficit contributes to parasite survival and species success in nature.
","Parasitoid wasps are insects whose development takes place within the body of other insects. To survive, wasp larvae must overcome the immune defenses of their hosts. How parasitic wasps overcome host immunity is not fully understood even though we know that different strategies using venoms, virus-like particles, or viruses are involved. A unique class of viruses, called polydnaviruses is found in two families of wasps that comprise more than 20,000 wasp species. The genomes of polydnaviruses encode proteins with ankyrin repeats. Ankyrin repeats are also found in Cactus, the inhibitor protein of NF-κB signaling in Drosophila. Viral ankyrin proteins, or Vankyrins, however, lack the amino acid sequences necessary for turnover found in Cactus and mammalian IκB family members. We show that Vankyrins produced by polydnaviruses of a parasitic wasp that attacks caterpillars of many common agricultural pests can block NF-κB signaling in fruit fly larvae. This inhibition supports parasite success. Our work highlights the crucial role of NF-κB signaling across insect taxa in insect-insect and insect-virus interactions. Studies of polydnaviral ankyrin proteins in Drosophila reveal that immune-suppressive viruses may block both cellular and humoral immunity in insects to win the biological ‘arms race’.

"The halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii has a multireplicon genome, consisting of a main chromosome, three secondary chromosomes, and a plasmid. Genes for the initiator protein Cdc6/Orc1, which are commonly located adjacent to archaeal origins of DNA replication, are found on all replicons except plasmid pHV2. However, prediction of DNA replication origins in H. volcanii is complicated by the fact that this species has no less than 14 cdc6/orc1 genes. We have used a combination of genetic, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches to map DNA replication origins in H. volcanii. Five autonomously replicating sequences were found adjacent to cdc6/orc1 genes and replication initiation point mapping was used to confirm that these sequences function as bidirectional DNA replication origins in vivo. Pulsed field gel analyses revealed that cdc6/orc1-associated replication origins are distributed not only on the main chromosome (2.9 Mb) but also on pHV1 (86 kb), pHV3 (442 kb), and pHV4 (690 kb) replicons. Gene inactivation studies indicate that linkage of the initiator gene to the origin is not required for replication initiation, and genetic tests with autonomously replicating plasmids suggest that the origin located on pHV1 and pHV4 may be dominant to the principal chromosomal origin. The replication origins we have identified appear to show a functional hierarchy or differential usage, which might reflect the different replication requirements of their respective chromosomes. We propose that duplication of H. volcanii replication origins was a prerequisite for the multireplicon structure of this genome, and that this might provide a means for chromosome-specific replication control under certain growth conditions. Our observations also suggest that H. volcanii is an ideal organism for studying how replication of four replicons is regulated in the context of the archaeal cell cycle.
","Haloferax volcanii is a member of the archaea, which are renowned for thriving in extreme environments. Archaea have circular chromosomes like bacteria but use enzymes similar to those found in eukaryotes to replicate their DNA. Few archaeal species have systems for genetics, and this has limited our understanding of DNA replication. We used genetics to map the chromosomal sites (origins) at which DNA replication initiates in H. volcanii. This species has a multipart genome comprising one main chromosome, three secondary chromosomes, and a plasmid. Five DNA replication origins were found and confirmed to function in vivo. All are adjacent to genes for the initiator protein Cdc6/Orc1, a common feature of archaeal replication origins. Two of the sequences are located on the main chromosome, confirming that multiple origins are often used to replicate circular chromosomes in archaea. Intriguingly, one of the origins from a secondary chromosome appears “dominant” to the principal chromosomal origin, suggesting either a hierarchy or differential usage of origins. This might reflect the different replication requirements of their respective chromosomes. Given the ease of genetic manipulation, H. volcanii holds great promise for studying how replication of four chromosomes is regulated in the context of the archaeal cell cycle.

"SUMOylation participates in ecdysteroid biosynthesis at the onset of metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Silencing the Drosophila SUMO homologue smt3 in the prothoracic gland leads to reduced lipid content, low ecdysone titers, and a block in the larval–pupal transition. Here we show that the SR-BI family of Scavenger Receptors mediates SUMO functions. Reduced levels of Snmp1 compromise lipid uptake in the prothoracic gland. In addition, overexpression of Snmp1 is able to recover lipid droplet levels in the smt3 knockdown prothoracic gland cells. Snmp1 expression depends on Ftz-f1 (an NR5A-type orphan nuclear receptor), the expression of which, in turn, depends on SUMO. Furthermore, we show by in vitro and in vivo experiments that Ftz-f1 is SUMOylated. RNAi–mediated knockdown of ftz-f1 phenocopies that of smt3 at the larval to pupal transition, thus Ftz-f1 is an interesting candidate to mediate some of the functions of SUMO at the onset of metamorphosis. Additionally, we demonstrate that the role of SUMOylation, Ftz-f1, and the Scavenger Receptors in lipid capture and mobilization is conserved in other steroidogenic tissues such as the follicle cells of the ovary. smt3 knockdown, as well as ftz-f1 or Scavenger knockdown, depleted the lipid content of the follicle cells, which could be rescued by Snmp1 overexpression. Therefore, our data provide new insights into the regulation of metamorphosis via lipid homeostasis, showing that Drosophila Smt3, Ftz-f1, and SR-BIs are part of a general mechanism for uptake of lipids such as cholesterol, required during development in steroidogenic tissues.
","Steroid hormones are cholesterol derivates that control many aspects of animal physiology, including development of the adult organisms, growth, energy storage, and reproduction. In insects, pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone precede molting and metamorphosis, the regulation of hormonal synthesis being a crucial step that determines animal viability and size. Reduced levels of the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO in the prothoracic gland block the synthesis of ecdysone, as SUMO is needed for cholesterol intake. Here we show that SUMO is required for the expression of Scavenger Receptors (Class B, type I). These membrane receptors are necessary for lipid uptake by the gland. Strikingly, their expression is sufficient to recover lipid content when SUMO is removed. The expression of the Scavenger Receptors depends on Ftz-f1, a nuclear transcription factor homologous to mammalian Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). Interestingly, the expression of Ftz-f1 also depends on SUMO and, in addition, Ftz-f1 is SUMOylated. This modification modulates its capacity to activate the Scavenger Receptor Snmp1. The role of SUMO, Scavenger Receptors, and Ftz-f1 on lipid intake is conserved in other tissues that synthesize steroid hormones, such as the ovaries. These factors are conserved in vertebrates, with mutations underlying human disease, so this mechanism to regulate lipid uptake could have implications for human health.

"Two-component signal transduction systems, where the phosphorylation state of a regulator protein is modulated by a sensor kinase, are common in bacteria and other microbes. In many of these systems, the sensor kinase is bifunctional catalyzing both, the phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation of the regulator protein in response to input signals. Previous studies have shown that systems with a bifunctional enzyme can adjust the phosphorylation level of the regulator protein independently of the total protein concentrations – a property known as concentration robustness. Here, I argue that two-component systems with a bifunctional enzyme may also exhibit ultrasensitivity if the input signal reciprocally affects multiple activities of the sensor kinase. To this end, I consider the case where an allosteric effector inhibits autophosphorylation and, concomitantly, activates the enzyme's phosphatase activity, as observed experimentally in the PhoQ/PhoP and NRII/NRI systems. A theoretical analysis reveals two operating regimes under steady state conditions depending on the effector affinity: If the affinity is low the system produces a graded response with respect to input signals and exhibits stimulus-dependent concentration robustness – consistent with previous experiments. In contrast, a high-affinity effector may generate ultrasensitivity by a similar mechanism as phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles with distinct converter enzymes. The occurrence of ultrasensitivity requires saturation of the sensor kinase's phosphatase activity, but is restricted to low effector concentrations, which suggests that this mode of operation might be employed for the detection and amplification of low abundant input signals. Interestingly, the same mechanism also applies to covalent modification cycles with a bifunctional converter enzyme, which suggests that reciprocal regulation, as a mechanism to generate ultrasensitivity, is not restricted to two-component systems, but may apply more generally to bifunctional enzyme systems.
","Bacteria often use two-component systems to sense and respond to environmental changes, which involves autophosphorylation of a sensor kinase and phosphotransfer to a cognate response regulator. However, despite conservation of this ‘classical’ scheme there exist substantial variations in the mechanism of phosphotransfer among systems. Also, many sensor kinases exhibit phosphatase activity raising the question whether such a bifunctional architecture enables special regulatory properties in the response behavior to input signals. According to previous studies, classical two-component systems are unlikely to produce sigmoidal response curves (ultrasensitivity) if the sensor protein is bifunctional. Here, I argue that this is not necessarily true if the input stimulus (allosteric effector) reciprocally affects multiple activities of the sensor kinase, as it seems to be common for bifunctional enzymes. To this end, I propose and analyze an extension of the experimentally well-supported Batchelor-Goulian model which shows that ultrasensitivity requires a high-affinity effector and saturation of the phosphatase activity. The underlying mechanism involves sequestration of the effector by the sensor kinase which restricts the occurrence of ultrasensitivity to sufficiently low effector concentrations. Hence, this operating regime might be useful to sense effector limitations or to amplify weak input signals.

"Neurons utilize bursts of action potentials as an efficient and reliable way to encode information. It is likely that the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons involved in burst generation may also participate in preserving its temporal features. Here we examined the contribution of the persistent and resurgent components of voltage-gated Na+ currents in modulating the burst discharge in sensory neurons. Using mathematical modeling, theory and dynamic-clamp electrophysiology, we show that, distinct from the persistent Na+ component which is important for membrane resonance and burst generation, the resurgent Na+ can help stabilize burst timing features including the duration and intervals. Moreover, such a physiological role for the resurgent Na+ offered noise tolerance and preserved the regularity of burst patterns. Model analysis further predicted a negative feedback loop between the persistent and resurgent gating variables which mediate such gain in burst stability. These results highlight a novel role for the voltage-gated resurgent Na+ component in moderating the entropy of burst-encoded neural information.
","The nervous system extracts meaningful information from natural environments to guide precise behaviors. Sensory neurons encode and relay such complex peripheral information as electrical events, known as action potentials or spikes. The timing intervals between the spikes carry stimulus-relevant information. Therefore, disruption of spike timing by random perturbations can compromise the nervous system function. In this study we investigated whether the widely-distributed voltage-gated sodium (Na+) ion channels important for spike generation can also serve as noise modulators in sensory neurons. We developed and utilized mathematical models for the different experimentally inseparable components of a complex Na+ channel current. This enabled phenomenological simplification and examination of the individual roles of Na+ components in spike timing control. We further utilized real-time closed-loop experiments to validate model predictions, and theoretical analysis to explain experimental outcomes. Using such multifaceted approach, we uncovered a novel role for a resurgent Na+ component in enhancing the reliability of spike timing and in noise modulation. Furthermore, our simplified model can be utilized in future computational and experimental studies to better understand the pathological consequences of Na+ channelopathies.

"The survival and persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis depends on its capacity to manipulate multiple host defense pathways, including the ability to actively inhibit the death by apoptosis of infected host cells. The genetic basis for this anti-apoptotic activity and its implication for mycobacterial virulence have not been demonstrated or elucidated. Using a novel gain-of-function genetic screen, we demonstrated that inhibition of infection-induced apoptosis of macrophages is controlled by multiple genetic loci in M. tuberculosis. Characterization of one of these loci in detail revealed that the anti-apoptosis activity was attributable to the type I NADH-dehydrogenase of M. tuberculosis, and was mainly due to the subunit of this multicomponent complex encoded by the nuoG gene. Expression of M. tuberculosis nuoG in nonpathogenic mycobacteria endowed them with the ability to inhibit apoptosis of infected human or mouse macrophages, and increased their virulence in a SCID mouse model. Conversely, deletion of nuoG in M. tuberculosis ablated its ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis and significantly reduced its virulence in mice. These results identify a key component of the genetic basis for an important virulence trait of M. tuberculosis and support a direct causal relationship between virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria and their ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis.
","The infection-induced suicide of host cells following invasion by intracellular pathogens is an ancient defense mechanism observed in multicellular organisms of both the animal and plant kingdoms. It is therefore not surprising that persistent pathogens of viral, bacterial, and protozoal origin have evolved to inhibit the induction of host cell death. M. tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis, has latently infected about one third of the world's population and can persist for decades in the lungs of infected, asymptomatic individuals. In the present study we have identified nuoG of M. tuberculosis, which encodes a subunit of the type I NADH dehydrogenase complex, as a critical bacterial gene for inhibition of host cell death. A mutant of M. tuberculosis in which nuoG was deleted triggered a marked increase in apoptosis by infected macrophages, and subsequent analysis of this mutant in the mouse tuberculosis model provided direct evidence for a causal link between the capacity to inhibit apoptosis and bacterial virulence. The discovery of anti-apoptosis genes in M. tuberculosis could provide a powerful approach to the generation of better attenuated vaccine strains, and may also identify a new group of drug targets for improved chemotherapy.

"Despite many experimental and computational studies of the gating transition of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), the structural basis of how ligand binding couples to channel gating remains unknown. By using a newly developed interpolated elastic network model (iENM), we have attempted to compute a likely transition pathway from the closed- to the open-channel conformation of pLGICs as captured by the crystal structures of two prokaryotic pLGICs. The iENM pathway predicts a sequence of structural events that begins at the ligand-binding loops and is followed by the displacements of two key loops (loop 2 and loop 7) at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domain, the tilting/bending of the pore-lining M2 helix, and subsequent movements of M4, M3 and M1 helices in the transmembrane domain. The predicted order of structural events is in broad agreement with the Φ-value analysis of α subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mutants, which supports a conserved core mechanism for ligand-gated channel opening in pLGICs. Further perturbation analysis has supported the critical role of certain intra-subunit and inter-subunit interactions in dictating the above sequence of events.
","Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels are a family of membrane proteins that open/close an ion-conducting channel in response to the binding of specific ligands. Some members of the family, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, play key physiological roles in signal transduction at synapses. Despite many experimental and computational studies of the gating transition of these pentameric ion channels, the structural basis of how ligand binding couples to channel opening remains uncertain. In particular, the all-atom computer simulation of the gating transition is limited to nanosecond ∼ microsecond time scales while the entire transition takes tens of microseconds. In this study, we have employed a highly efficient coarse-grained modeling method to dissect the sequence of structural events underlying the gating transition. The model predictions are in broad agreement with the kinetic analysis of mutants of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This study has established a useful computational framework to simulate the functional dynamics of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.

"A better description of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of fatal patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is important in alerting clinicians of severe dengue and improving management.
Of 309 adults with DHF, 10 fatal patients and 299 survivors (controls) were retrospectively analyzed. Regarding causes of fatality, massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was found in 4 patients, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) alone in 2; DSS/subarachnoid hemorrhage, Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia, ventilator associated pneumonia, and massive GI bleeding/Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia each in one. Fatal patients were found to have significantly higher frequencies of early altered consciousness (≤24 h after hospitalization), hypothermia, GI bleeding/massive GI bleeding, DSS, concurrent bacteremia with/without shock, pulmonary edema, renal/hepatic failure, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Among those experienced early altered consciousness, massive GI bleeding alone/with uremia/with E. faecalis bacteremia, and K. pneumoniae meningitis/bacteremia were each found in one patient. Significantly higher proportion of bandemia from initial (arrival) laboratory data in fatal patients as compared to controls, and higher proportion of pre-fatal leukocytosis and lower pre-fatal platelet count as compared to initial laboratory data of fatal patients were found. Massive GI bleeding (33.3%) and bacteremia (25%) were the major causes of pre-fatal leukocytosis in the deceased patients; 33.3% of the patients with pre-fatal profound thrombocytopenia (<20000/µL), and 50% of the patients with pre-fatal prothrombin time (PT) prolongation experienced massive GI bleeding.
Our report highlights causes of fatality other than DSS in patients with severe dengue, and suggested hypothermia, leukocytosis and bandemia may be warning signs of severe dengue. Clinicians should be alert to the potential development of massive GI bleeding, particularly in patients with early altered consciousness, profound thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT and/or leukocytosis. Antibiotic(s) should be empirically used for patients at risk for bacteremia until it is proven otherwise, especially in those with early altered consciousness and leukocytosis.
","Fatality rate and causes of fatality in dengue-affected patients greatly varied from one reported series to another. A better understanding of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of fatal patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is important in alerting clinicians of severe dengue and improving management. In a retrospective analysis of 10 adults who died of and 299 survived (controls) DHF, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) alone was found in only 20% of dengue-related death, while intractable massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was found in 40%, and DSS with concurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage, intractable massive GI bleeding with concurrent bacteremia, bacterial sepsis/meningitis, and sepsis due to ventilator associated pneumonia each were found in 10%. Early altered consciousness (developed ≤24 h after hospitalization), GI bleeding/massive GI bleeding and concurrent bacteremia were significantly found among the deceased patients. Our data suggest that hypothermia, leukocytosis and bandemia at hospital presentation may be warning signs of severe dengue. Clinicians should be alert to the potential development of massive GI bleeding, particularly in patients with early altered consciousness, profound thrombocytopenia, prothrombin time prolongation and/or leukocytosis. Antibiotic(s) should be empirically used for patients at risk for bacteremia until it is proven otherwise, especially in those with early altered consciousness and leukocytosis.

"The development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms relies on gene regulation within individual constituent cells. Gene regulatory circuits that increase the robustness of gene expression frequently incorporate microRNAs as post-transcriptional regulators. Computational approaches, synthetic gene circuits and observations in model organisms predict that the co-regulation of microRNAs and their target mRNAs can reduce cell-to-cell variability in the expression of target genes. However, whether microRNAs directly regulate variability of endogenous gene expression remains to be tested in mammalian cells. Here we use quantitative flow cytometry to show that microRNAs impact on cell-to-cell variability of protein expression in developing mouse thymocytes. We find two distinct mechanisms that control variation in the activation-induced expression of the microRNA target CD69. First, the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a, two members of the miR-17-92 cluster, is co-regulated with the target mRNA Cd69 to form an activation-induced incoherent feed-forward loop. Another microRNA, miR-181a, acts at least in part upstream of the target mRNA Cd69 to modulate cellular responses to activation. The ability of microRNAs to render gene expression more uniform across mammalian cell populations may be important for normal development and for disease.
","microRNAs are integral to many developmental processes and may 'canalise' development by reducing cell-to-cell variation in gene expression. This idea is supported by computational studies that have modeled the impact of microRNAs on the expression of their targets and the construction of artificial incoherent feedforward loops using synthetic biology tools. Here we show that this interesting principle of microRNA regulation actually occurs in a mammalian developmental system. We examine cell-to-cell variation of protein expression in developing mouse thymocytes by quantitative flow cytometry and find that the absence of microRNAs results in increased cell-to-cell variation in the expression of the microRNA target Cd69. Mechanistically, T cell receptor signaling induces both Cd69 and miR-17 and miR-20a, two microRNAs that target Cd69. Co-regulation of microRNAs and their target mRNA dampens the expression of Cd69 and forms an incoherent feedforward loop that reduces cell-to-cell variation on CD69 expression. In addition, miR-181, which also targets Cd69 and is a known modulator of T cell receptor signaling, also affects cell-to-cell variation of CD69 expression. The ability of microRNAs to control the uniformity of gene expression across mammalian cell populations may be important for normal development and for disease.

"Chagas disease is an endemic zoonosis native to the Americas and is caused by the kinetoplastid protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite is also highly genetically diverse, with six discrete typing units (DTUs) reported TcI – TcVI. These DTUs broadly correlate with several epidemiogical, ecological and pathological features of Chagas disease. In this manuscript we report the most comprehensive evaluation to date of the genetic diversity of T. cruzi in Venezuela. The dataset includes 778 samples collected and genotyped over the last twelve years from multiple hosts and vectors, including nine wild and domestic mammalian host species, and seven species of triatomine bug, as well as from human sources. Most isolates (732) can be assigned to the TcI clade (94.1%); 24 to the TcIV group (3.1%) and 22 to TcIII (2.8%). Importantly, among the 95 isolates genotyped from human disease cases, 79% belonged to TcI - a DTU common in the Americas, however, 21% belonged to TcIV- a little known genotype previously thought to be rare in humans. Furthermore, were able to assign multiple oral Chagas diseases cases to TcI in the area around the capital, Caracas. We discuss our findings in the context of T. cruzi DTU distributions elsewhere in the Americas, and evaluate the impact they have on the future of Chagas disease control in Venezuela.
","Chagas disease is caused by a protozoan parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi infects a wide variety of mammal species in Latin America as well as man, and is spread by multiple species of blood sucking triatomine insect vectors. The presence of genetic diversity in T. cruzi in the Americas is well established, with six different major genetic types in circulation. The genetic diversity of T. cruzi in Venezuela is relatively poorly understood. In this work we present the results from the genotyping of over seven hundred isolates from 17 of the 24 states. Our dataset comprises strains isolated from wild and domestic animals, several species of triatomine vector, as well as from human Chagas disease cases, including those associated with oral transmission of T. cruzi. Amongst other findings, our data reveal a surprisingly high frequency of atypical genotypes in humans, particularly TcIV, which has rarely been reported. We evaluate our findings in the context of T. cruzi diversity elsewhere in the Americas, and assess the impact they have on the future of Chagas disease control in Venezuela.

"Eukaryotic protein kinases regulate most cellular functions by phosphorylating targeted protein substrates through a highly conserved catalytic core. In the active state, the catalytic core oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. Currently, the intramolecular interactions that regulate the active state mechanics are not well understood. Here, using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a representative model coupled with biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques, we define a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions working harmoniously to regulate these mechanics. These include the previously identified salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. Moreover, for over three decades it was thought that the highly conserved β3-lysine was essential for phosphoryl transfer, but our findings show that the β3-lysine is not required for phosphoryl transfer but is essential for the active state mechanics.
","Eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs) regulate over a third of the human proteome by transferring the γ-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a protein substrate in a process known as protein phosphorylation. Biochemical and biophysical studies have shown that EPKs undergo multiconformational rearrangements in which the catalytic core is oscillating between open, intermediate, and closed conformations when active. Presently, the intramolecular interactions that regulate this dynamic process are not well understood. In this paper, we show how a set of conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions harmoniously regulate the active state mechanics. The electrostatic interactions involve the highly conserved salt bridge between the lysine from subdomain-II and glutamate from subdomain-III as well as an interaction between the activation loop and αC-helix. The hydrophobic interactions include the nonlinear motifs known as the Regulatory spine and Shell that traverse both lobes of the catalytic core. Furthermore, our findings show that the highly conserved “catalytic lysine” is not directly required for phosphoryl transfer but rather serves as a hub that aligns and positions the dynamic core elements required for catalysis.

"Structural plasticity governs the long-term development of synaptic connections in the neocortex. While the underlying processes at the synapses are not fully understood, there is strong evidence that a process of random, independent formation and pruning of excitatory synapses can be ruled out. Instead, there must be some cooperation between the synaptic contacts connecting a single pre- and postsynaptic neuron pair. So far, the mechanism of cooperation is not known. Here we demonstrate that local correlation detection at the postsynaptic dendritic spine suffices to explain the synaptic cooperation effect, without assuming any hypothetical direct interaction pathway between the synaptic contacts. Candidate biomolecular mechanisms for dendritic correlation detection have been identified previously, as well as for structural plasticity based thereon. By analyzing and fitting of a simple model, we show that spike-timing correlation dependent structural plasticity, without additional mechanisms of cross-synapse interaction, can reproduce the experimentally observed distributions of numbers of synaptic contacts between pairs of neurons in the neocortex. Furthermore, the model yields a first explanation for the existence of both transient and persistent dendritic spines and allows to make predictions for future experiments.
","Structural plasticity has been observed even in the adult mammalian neocortex – in seemingly static neuronal circuits structural remodeling is continuously at work. Still, it has been shown that the connection patterns between pairs of neurons are not random. In contrast, there is evidence that the synaptic contacts between a pair of neurons cooperate: several experimental studies report either zero or about 3–6 synapses between neuron pairs. The mechanism by which the synapses cooperate, however, has not yet been identified. Here we propose a model for structural plasticity that relies on local processes at the dendritic spine. We combine and extend the previous models and determine the equilibrium probability distribution of synaptic contact numbers of the model. By optimizing the parameters numerically for each of three reference datasets, we obtain equilibrium contact number distributions that fit the references very well. We conclude that the local dendritic mechanisms that we assume suffice to explain the cooperative synapse formation in the neocortex.

"We have previously shown a reduction in anaemia and wasting malnutrition in infants <3 years old in Pemba Island, Zanzibar, following repeated anthelminthic treatment for the endemic gastrointestinal (GI) nematodes Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura. In view of the low intensity of worm infections in this age group, this was unexpected, and it was proposed that immune responses to the worms rather than their direct effects may play a significant role in morbidity in infants and that anthelminthic treatment may alleviate such effects. Therefore, the primary aims of this study were to characterise the immune response to initial/early GI nematode infections in infants and the effects of anthelminthic treatment on such immune responses. The frequency and levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ and IL-10) induced by the worms were evaluated in 666 infants aged 6–24 months using the Whole Blood Assay. Ascaris and hookworm antigens induced predominantly Th2 cytokine responses, and levels of IL-5 and IL-13 were significantly correlated. The frequencies and levels of responses were higher for both Ascaris positive and hookworm positive infants compared with worm negative individuals, but very few infants made Trichuris-specific cytokine responses. Infants treated every 3 months with mebendazole showed a significantly lower prevalence of infection compared with placebo-treated controls at one year following baseline. At follow-up, cytokine responses to Ascaris and hookworm antigens, which remained Th2 biased, were increased compared with baseline but were not significantly affected by treatment. However, blood eosinophil levels, which were elevated in worm-infected children, were significantly lower in treated children. Thus the effect of deworming in this age group on anaemia and wasting malnutrition, which were replicated in this study, could not be explained by modification of cytokine responses but may be related to eosinophil function.
","Infants and very young children commonly become infected with intestinal nematode infections. However, the worm burdens are generally very light, so a beneficial effect of deworming on wasting malnutrition and anaemia in this age group which we have demonstrated was unexpected and the mechanism unclear. To investigate this, we have, for the first time, determined whether such worm infections in infants induce significant immune reactions which might be detrimental to nutrition and growth e.g. by inducing inflammation in the gut or by cytokine effects on erythropoiesis. We also determined if such responses are modulated by regular deworming over a 9 month period. Peripheral blood cells from infants infected with Ascaris and hookworms in particular responded to stimulation with worm antigens, producing predominantly Th2 cytokines. Although the Th2 cytokine responses in the periphery were not significantly altered by deworming, the levels of eosinophils, which are regulated by the Th2 cytokine, IL-5, were lower after treatment. It is possible that eosinophils play a role in gut pathology leading to wasting malnutrition and anaemia in the very young and that this effect is reduced by deworming.

"The temporal order of replication of mammalian chromosomes appears to be linked to their functional organization, but the process that establishes and modifies this order during cell differentiation remains largely unknown. Here, we studied how the replication of the Igh locus initiates, progresses, and terminates in bone marrow pro-B cells undergoing B cell commitment. We show that many aspects of DNA replication can be quantitatively explained by a mechanism involving the stochastic firing of origins (across the S phase and the Igh locus) and extensive variations in their firing rate (along the locus). The firing rate of origins shows a high degree of coordination across Igh domains that span tens to hundreds of kilobases, a phenomenon not observed in simple eukaryotes. Differences in domain sizes and firing rates determine the temporal order of replication. During B cell commitment, the expression of the B-cell-specific factor Pax5 sharply alters the temporal order of replication by modifying the rate of origin firing within various Igh domains (particularly those containing Pax5 binding sites). We propose that, within the Igh CH-3′RR domain, Pax5 is responsible for both establishing and maintaining high rates of origin firing, mostly by controlling events downstream of the assembly of pre-replication complexes.
","Each time a mammalian cell duplicates its genome in preparation for cell division it activates thousands of so called “DNA origins of replication.” The timely and complete duplication of the genome depends on careful orchestration of origin activation, which is modified when cells differentiate to perform a specific function. We currently lack a universally accepted model of origin regulation that can explain the replication dynamics in complex eukaryotes. Here, we studied the mouse immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, one of the antibody-encoding portions of the genome, where origins change activity when antibody-producing B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. We show that multiple aspects of DNA replication initiation, progression, and termination can be explained mathematically by the interplay between randomly firing origins and two independent variables: the speed of progression of replication forks and the firing rate of origins along the locus. The rate of origin firing varies extensively along the locus during B cell differentiation and, thus, is a dominant factor in establishing the temporal order of replication. A differentiation factor called Pax5 can alter the temporal order of replication by modifying the rate of origin firing across various parts of the locus.

"Sporotrichosis is endemic in the Sub-Himalayan belt, which ranges from the northern to the north-eastern Indian subcontinent. Similar to many parts of the developing world, sporotrichosis is commonly recognized clinically in this region however consolidated epidemiological data is lacking. We report epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data from a hundred culture positive cases of sporotrichosis. Out of 305 clinically suspicious cases of sporotrichosis, a total of 100 isolates were identified as Sporothrix schenckii species complex (S. schenckii) on culture. Out of the culture proven cases 71% of the cases presented with lymphocutaneous type of lesions while 28% had fixed localized type and 1% had disseminated sporotrichosis. Presentation with lesions on hands was most frequently seen in 32% with arm (23%) and face (21%) in that sequence. The male to female ratio was 1∶1.27. Age ranged from 1 ½ years to 88 years. Mean age was 43.25 years. Disease was predominantly seen in the fourth to sixth decade of life with 58% cases between 31 and 60 years of age. Since the first report from the region there has been a steady rise in the number of cases of sporotrichosis. Seasonal trends reveal that most of the patients visited for consultation in the beginning of the year between March and April. This is the first study, from the most endemic region of the Sub-Himalayan belt, to delve into epidemiological and clinical details of such a large number of culture proven cases over a period of more than eighteen years which would help in the understanding of the local disease pattern of sporotrichosis.
","Sporotrichosis is a sub-acute or chronic granulomatous fungal infection involving mainly the skin and subcutaneous tissue with neighbouring lymphatics. It is caused by thermally dimorphic fungus, Sporothrix schenckii, which is prevalent worldwide. Consequent to trauma, the fungus establishes itself in skin and subcutaneous tissue of gardeners, forestry workers, farmers, carpenters, and others who are involved in outdoor activities. Sporotrichosis is the most frequently encountered sub-cutaneous mycosis in the sub-Himalayan belt and all previous reports are based on clinical review. It is imperative to understand the epidemiology of sporotrichosis as an accurate diagnosis, and prompt initiation of the appropriate treatment would prevent chronic debility. This is the first extensive compilation of culture proven cases from Himachal Pradesh in India. It thus justifies our interest in analysing data from our institute seen over 18 years and 7 months, with the objective to compare the demographic factors, briefing the clinical aspects and the culture characteristics of the isolates obtained from the clinical material.

"Despite considerable research efforts, little is yet known about key epidemiological parameters of H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza viruses in their avian hosts. Here we show how these parameters can be estimated using a limited number of birds in experimental transmission studies. Our quantitative estimates, based on Bayesian methods of inference, reveal that (i) the period of latency of H5N1 influenza virus in unvaccinated chickens is short (mean: 0.24 days; 95% credible interval: 0.099–0.48 days); (ii) the infectious period of H5N1 virus in unvaccinated chickens is approximately 2 days (mean: 2.1 days; 95%CI: 1.8–2.3 days); (iii) the reproduction number of H5N1 virus in unvaccinated chickens need not be high (mean: 1.6; 95%CI: 0.90–2.5), although the virus is expected to spread rapidly because it has a short generation interval in unvaccinated chickens (mean: 1.3 days; 95%CI: 1.0–1.5 days); and (iv) vaccination with genetically and antigenically distant H5N2 vaccines can effectively halt transmission. Simulations based on the estimated parameters indicate that herd immunity may be obtained if at least 80% of chickens in a flock are vaccinated. We discuss the implications for the control of H5N1 avian influenza virus in areas where it is endemic.
","Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry first occurred in China in 1996. Since that time, the virus has become endemic in Asia, and has been the cause of outbreaks in Africa and Europe. Although many aspects of H5N1 virus biology have been studied in detail, surprisingly little is known about the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in its avian hosts (the length of time from infection until a bird becomes infectious, the duration of infectiousness, how many birds each infectious bird will infect). In this paper we show, using experimental transmission studies with unvaccinated and vaccinated chickens, that H5N1 avian influenza induces a short duration of infectiousness (∼2 days) and a very short period of time from infection until infectiousness (∼0.25 day) in unvaccinated chickens. Furthermore, while transmission was efficient among unvaccinated birds, no bird-to-bird transmission was observed in vaccinated chickens. Our results indicate that it may be difficult to curb outbreaks by vaccination after an introduction in a flock has been detected. On the other hand, preventive vaccination could be effective in preventing virus introductions and limiting the size of outbreaks.

"In order to control malaria, it is important to understand the genetic structure of the parasites in each endemic area. Plasmodium vivax is widely distributed in the tropical to temperate regions of Asia and South America, but effective strategies for its elimination have yet to be designed. In South Korea, for example, indigenous vivax malaria was eliminated by the late 1970s, but re-emerged from 1993. We estimated the population structure and temporal dynamics of transmission of P. vivax in South Korea using microsatellite DNA markers.
We analyzed 255 South Korean P. vivax isolates collected from 1994 to 2008, based on 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci of the P. vivax genome. Allelic data were obtained for the 87 isolates and their microsatellite haplotypes were determined based on a combination of allelic data of the loci. In total, 40 haplotypes were observed. There were two predominant haplotypes: H16 and H25. H16 was observed in 9 isolates (10%) from 1996 to 2005, and H25 in 27 (31%) from 1995 to 2003. These results suggested that the recombination rate of P. vivax in South Korea, a temperate country, was lower than in tropical areas where identical haplotypes were rarely seen in the following year. Next, we estimated the relationships among the 40 haplotypes by eBURST analysis. Two major groups were found: one composed of 36 isolates (41%) including H25; the other of 20 isolates (23%) including H16. Despite the low recombination rate, other new haplotypes that are genetically distinct from the 2 groups have also been observed since 1997 (H27).
These results suggested a continual introduction of P. vivax from other population sources, probably North Korea. Molecular epidemiology using microsatellite DNA of the P. vivax population is effective for assessing the population structure and transmission dynamics of the parasites - information that can assist in the elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas.
","Vivax malaria is widely prevalent, mainly in Asia and South America with 390 million reported cases in 2009. Worldwide, in the same year, 2.85 billion people were at risk. Plasmodium vivax is prevalent not only in tropical and subtropical areas but also in temperate areas where there are no mosquitoes in cold seasons. While most malaria researchers are focusing their studies on the parasite in tropical areas, we examined the characteristics of P. vivax in South Korea (temperate area) temporally, using 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite DNA (a short tandem repeat DNA sequence) in the parasite genome, and highlighted the differences between the tropical and temperate populations. We found that the South Korean P. vivax population had low genetic diversity and low recombination rates in comparison to tropical P. vivax populations that had been reported. We also found that some of the parasite clones in the population were changing from 1994 to 2008, evidence suggesting the continual introduction of the parasite from other populations, probably from North Korea. Polymorphic DNA markers of the P. vivax parasite are useful tools for estimating the situation of its transmission in endemic areas.

"The arsenal in anthelminthic treatment against schistosomiasis is limited and relies almost exclusively on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). Thus, resistance to PZQ could constitute a major threat. Even though PZQ is potent in killing adult worms, its activity against earlier stages is limited. Current in vitro drug screening strategies depend on newly transformed schistosomula (NTS) for initial hit identification, thereby limiting sensitivity to new compounds predominantly active in later developmental stages. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish a highly standardized, straightforward and reliable culture method to generate and maintain advanced larval stages in vitro. We present here how this method can be a valuable tool to test drug efficacy at each intermediate larval stage, reducing the reliance on animal use (3Rs).
Cercariae were mechanically transformed into skin-stage (SkS) schistosomula and successfully cultured for up to four weeks with no loss in viability in a commercially available medium. Under these serum- and cell-free conditions, development halted at the lung-stage (LuS). However, the addition of human serum (HSe) propelled further development into liver stage (LiS) worms within eight weeks. Skin and lung stages, as well as LiS, were submitted to 96-well drug screening assays using known anti-schistosomal compounds such as PZQ, oxamniquine (OXM), mefloquine (MFQ) and artemether (ART). Our findings showed stage-dependent differences in larval susceptibility to these compounds.
With this robust and highly standardized in vitro assay, important developmental stages of S. mansoni up to LiS worms can be generated and maintained over prolonged periods of time. The phenotype of LiS worms, when exposed to reference drugs, was comparable to most previously published works for ex vivo harvested adult worms. Therefore, this in vitro assay can help reduce reliance on animal experiments in search for new anti-schistosomal drugs.
","Schistosomiasis remains a major health threat, predominantly in developing countries. Even though there has been some progress in search of new drugs, praziquantel remains the only available drug. Probably the most important advance in the search for new drugs was in vitro transformation of cercariae and their subsequent culture. However, hit identification in compound screenings is exclusively tested in skin stage parasites and is only confirmed for more mature worms in a subsequent step. This is in part due to the lack of an easy culture system for advance-stage parasites. We present here a reliable and highly standardized way to generate LiS worms in vitro in a cell-free culture system. The inclusion of in vitro drug tests on advanced-stage parasites in initial hit identification will help to identify compounds that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, the ability to continuously observe the parasite’s development in vitro will provide an important platform for a better understanding of its maturation in the human host. Taken together, this opens up new avenues to investigate the influence of specific cell types or host proteins on the development of Schistosoma mansoni and provides an additional tool to reduce animal use in future drug discovery efforts (3Rs).

"Telomere-binding proteins constituting the shelterin complex have been studied primarily for telomeric functions. However, mounting evidence shows non-telomeric binding and gene regulation by shelterin factors. This raises a key question—do telomeres impact binding of shelterin proteins at distal non-telomeric sites? Here we show that binding of the telomere-repeat-binding-factor-2 (TRF2) at promoters ~60 Mb from telomeres depends on telomere length in human cells. Promoter TRF2 occupancy was depleted in cells with elongated telomeres resulting in altered TRF2-mediated transcription of distal genes. In addition, histone modifications—activation (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3) as well as silencing marks (H3K27me3)—at distal promoters were telomere length-dependent. These demonstrate that transcription, and the epigenetic state, of telomere-distal promoters can be influenced by telomere length. Molecular links between telomeres and the extra-telomeric genome, emerging from findings here, might have important implications in telomere-related physiology, particularly ageing and cancer.
","Telomeres (special DNA-protein assemblies that protect chromosome ends) affect ageing and diseases such as cancer. Although this has been recognized for many years, biological processes that connect telomeres to ageing, cancer and other cellular functions remain to be fully understood. Certain proteins, believed to be only telomere-associated, engage DNA outside telomeres. This raises an interesting question. Does telomere length influence how telomere-binding proteins associate with DNA at regions distal from telomeres. If so, how does this impact function? Motivated by these questions, in the present studies we tested if extra-telomeric binding of the well-known telomere-repeat-binding-actor-2 (TRF2) depends on telomere length. Our results show that the level of DNA-bound TRF2 at telomere-distal sites changes as telomeres shorten or elongate. Consequently, TRF2-mediated gene regulation affects many genes. Notably, histone modifications that dictate chromatin compaction and access to regulatory factors, at sites distant from telomere ends also depended on telomere length. Together, this links the state of telomeres to gene regulation and epigenetics directly in ways not previously appreciated that might impact a more complete understanding of molecular processes underlying ageing and cancer.

"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) latency establishment is tightly controlled by promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) (or ND10), although their exact contribution is still elusive. A hallmark of HSV-1 latency is the interaction between latent viral genomes and PML NBs, leading to the formation of viral DNA-containing PML NBs (vDCP NBs), and the complete silencing of HSV-1. Using a replication-defective HSV-1-infected human primary fibroblast model reproducing the formation of vDCP NBs, combined with an immuno-FISH approach developed to detect latent/quiescent HSV-1, we show that vDCP NBs contain both histone H3.3 and its chaperone complexes, i.e., DAXX/ATRX and HIRA complex (HIRA, UBN1, CABIN1, and ASF1a). HIRA also co-localizes with vDCP NBs present in trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons from HSV-1-infected wild type mice. ChIP and Re-ChIP show that vDCP NBs-associated latent/quiescent viral genomes are chromatinized almost exclusively with H3.3 modified on its lysine (K) 9 by trimethylation, consistent with an interaction of the H3.3 chaperones with multiple viral loci and with the transcriptional silencing of HSV-1. Only simultaneous inactivation of both H3.3 chaperone complexes has a significant impact on the deposition of H3.3 on viral genomes, suggesting a compensation mechanism. In contrast, the sole depletion of PML significantly impacts the chromatinization of the latent/quiescent viral genomes with H3.3 without any overall replacement with H3.1. vDCP NBs-associated HSV-1 genomes are not definitively silenced since the destabilization of vDCP NBs by ICP0, which is essential for HSV-1 reactivation in vivo, allows the recovery of a transcriptional lytic program and the replication of viral genomes. Consequently, the present study demonstrates a specific chromatin regulation of vDCP NBs-associated latent/quiescent HSV-1 through an H3.3-dependent HSV-1 chromatinization involving the two H3.3 chaperones DAXX/ATRX and HIRA complexes. Additionally, the study reveals that PML NBs are major actors in latent/quiescent HSV-1 H3.3 chromatinization through a PML NB/histone H3.3/H3.3 chaperone axis.
","An understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to the persistence of a virus in its host is essential to be able to control viral reactivation and its associated diseases. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen that remains latent in the PNS and CNS of the infected host. The latency is unstable, and frequent reactivations of the virus are responsible for PNS and CNS pathologies. It is thus crucial to understand the physiological, immunological and molecular levels of interplay between latent HSV-1 and the host. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) control viral infections by preventing the onset of lytic infection. In previous studies, we showed a major role of PML NBs in favoring the establishment of a latent state for HSV-1. A hallmark of HSV-1 latency establishment is the formation of PML NBs containing the viral genome, which we called “viral DNA-containing PML NBs” (vDCP NBs). The genome entrapped in the vDCP NBs is transcriptionally silenced. This naturally occurring latent/quiescent state could, however, be transcriptionally reactivated. Therefore, understanding the role of PML NBs in controlling the establishment of HSV-1 latency and its reactivation is essential to design new therapeutic approaches based on the prevention of viral reactivation.

"Gene-expression deconvolution is used to quantify different types of cells in a mixed population. It provides a highly promising solution to rapidly characterize the tumor-infiltrating immune landscape and identify cold cancers. However, a major challenge is that gene-expression data are frequently contaminated by many outliers that decrease the estimation accuracy. Thus, it is imperative to develop a robust deconvolution method that automatically decontaminates data by reliably detecting and removing outliers. We developed a new machine learning tool, Fast And Robust DEconvolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), to enumerate immune cell subsets from whole tumor tissue samples. To reduce noise in the tumor gene expression datasets, FARDEEP utilizes an adaptive least trimmed square to automatically detect and remove outliers before estimating the cell compositions. We show that FARDEEP is less susceptible to outliers and returns a better estimation of coefficients than the existing methods with both numerical simulations and real datasets. FARDEEP provides an estimate related to the absolute quantity of each immune cell subset in addition to relative percentages. Hence, FARDEEP represents a novel robust algorithm to complement the existing toolkit for the characterization of tissue-infiltrating immune cell landscape. The source code for FARDEEP is implemented in R and available for download at https://github.com/YuningHao/FARDEEP.git.
","Rapidly emerging evidence suggests that the tumor immune microenvironment not only predisposes cancer patients to diverse treatment outcomes but also represents a promising source of biomarkers for better patient stratification. Different from the immunohistochemistry-based scoring practice, which focuses on a few selected marker proteins, immune deconvolution pipelines inform a previously untapped method to comprehensively reveal the tumor-infiltrating immune landscape. Recognizing the numerous strengths of existing immune deconvolution algorithms, here we show data outliers, which are inevitable in whole tissue sequencing data sets, substantially skew estimation results. Moreover, an estimate related to the absolute amount of each immune subset offers valuable insight into the nature of the host response in addition to percentage information alone. Thus, we engineered a new immune deconvolution pipeline, coined as Fast and Robust Deconvolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), to automatically detect and remove outliers prior feeding data into the deconvolution algorithm and to provide estimates related to the absolute quantity of each immune subset. Utilizing both synthetic and real data sets, we found that FARDEEP returns superior coefficients and offers a robust tool to reveal the immune landscape of human cancers.

"Chlamydia trachomatis attachment to cells induces the secretion of the elementary body–associated protein TARP (Translocated Actin Recruiting Protein). TARP crosses the plasma membrane where it is immediately phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by unknown host kinases. The Rac GTPase is also activated, resulting in WAVE2 and Arp2/3-dependent recruitment of actin to the sites of chlamydia attachment. We show that TARP participates directly in chlamydial invasion activating the Rac-dependent signaling cascade to recruit actin. TARP functions by binding two distinct Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), Sos1 and Vav2, in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. The tyrosine phosphorylation profile of the sequence YEPISTENIYESI within TARP, as well as the transient activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), appears to determine which GEF is utilized to activate Rac. The first and second tyrosine residues, when phosphorylated, are utilized by the Sos1/Abi1/Eps8 and Vav2, respectively, with the latter requiring the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Depletion of these critical signaling molecules by siRNA resulted in inhibition of chlamydial invasion to varying degrees, owing to a possible functional redundancy of the two pathways. Collectively, these data implicate TARP in signaling to the actin cytoskeleton remodeling machinery, demonstrating a mechanism by which C. trachomatis invades non-phagocytic cells.
","The human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis is the causative agent of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted disease in industrialized nations, and of the preventable blinding condition trachoma in developing countries. Survival and replication of chlamydial species occur exclusively inside a host cell, and thus, gaining access to the protective intracellular niche is an absolute requirement. This report describes how the chlamydia protein TARP, which is secreted at the base of the bacteria and across the host membrane, acts as a scaffold to which host signaling proteins bind. This assembly of the complex of signaling proteins, which include Sos1, Abi1, Eps8, and Vav2 results in the remodeling of the host cytoskeleton to facilitate engulfment of the infecting chlamydia. We conclude that these proteins have a role in chlamydia based on a number of observations including their interaction with the TARP protein, their ability to switch on known signaling participants in chlamydia invasion, their localization at the site of chlamydia entry, and the inhibition of chlamydia invasion in their absence. Altogether, the data functionally link TARP with signaling pathways that function in chlamydial invasion, demonstrating the direct involvement of TARP in the invasion of host cells by C. trachomatis.

"IFN-γ–producing CD4 T cells are required for protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, but the extent to which IFN-γ contributes to overall CD4 T cell-mediated protection remains unclear. Furthermore, it is not known if increasing IFN-γ production by CD4 T cells is desirable in Mtb infection. Here we show that IFN-γ accounts for only ~30% of CD4 T cell-dependent cumulative bacterial control in the lungs over the first six weeks of infection, but >80% of control in the spleen. Moreover, increasing the IFN-γ–producing capacity of CD4 T cells by ~2 fold exacerbates lung infection and leads to the early death of the host, despite enhancing control in the spleen. In addition, we show that the inhibitory receptor PD-1 facilitates host resistance to Mtb by preventing the detrimental over-production of IFN-γ by CD4 T cells. Specifically, PD-1 suppressed the parenchymal accumulation of and pathogenic IFN-γ production by the CXCR3+KLRG1-CX3CR1- subset of lung-homing CD4 T cells that otherwise mediates control of Mtb infection. Therefore, the primary role for T cell-derived IFN-γ in Mtb infection is at extra-pulmonary sites, and the host-protective subset of CD4 T cells requires negative regulation of IFN-γ production by PD-1 to prevent lethal immune-mediated pathology.
","The development of novel tuberculosis vaccines has been hindered by the poor understanding of the mechanisms of host-protection. It has been long-held that IFN-γ is the principle effector of CD4 T cell-mediated resistance to Mtb infection, but Mtb-specific CD4 T cells produce low amounts of IFN-γ in vivo, leading to the possibility that increasing IFN-γ production by Th1 cells might enhance control of Mtb infection. However, the precise contribution of IFN-γ to CD4 T cell-dependent protection and the outcome of increasing IFN-γ production by CD4 T cells have not been evaluated. Here we show that IFN-γ accounts for only ~30% of the cumulative CD4 T cell-mediated reduction in lung bacterial loads over the first 1.5 months of infection. Moreover, we find that increasing the per capita production of IFN-γ by CD4 T cells leads to the early death of the host. Lastly, we show that suppression of CD4 T cell-derived IFN-γ by the inhibitory receptor PD-1 is essential to prevent lethal disease. Therefore, poor control Mtb infection does not result from defective production of IFN-γ, and strategies to selectively boost it are unwarranted. Furthermore, identifying the primary mechanisms of CD4 T cell-dependent control of Mtb infection should be a priority.

"Microbial biofilms are a dominant feature of many human infections. However, developing effective strategies for controlling biofilms requires an understanding of the underlying biology well beyond what currently exists. Using a novel strategy, we have induced formation of a robust biofilm in Escherichia coli by utilizing an exogenous source of poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) polymer, a major virulence factor of many pathogens. Through microarray profiling of competitive selections, carried out in both transposon insertion and over-expression libraries, we have revealed the genetic basis of PNAG-based biofilm formation. Our observations reveal the dominance of electrostatic interactions between PNAG and surface structures such as lipopolysaccharides. We show that regulatory modulation of these surface structures has significant impact on biofilm formation behavior of the cell. Furthermore, the majority of clinical isolates which produced PNAG also showed the capacity to respond to the exogenously produced version of the polymer.
","Both in the wild and in the clinical setting many bacterial species live within surface-attached communities called biofilms. It is still unclear the extent to which the biofilm lifestyle and its associated phenotypes, such as hyper-tolerance to antimicrobial agents, can be attributed to structural characteristics of the biofilm community or to intrinsic biofilm-specific physiological programs. In order to address this longstanding question, we focused on poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG)–based biofilms, a clinically relevant phenotype of many bacterial pathogens, including E. coli. Instead of working in a biofilm-permissive genetic background, in which the timescale of biofilm formation is slow, we applied the functionally active secreted version of the PNAG exo-polysaccharide (sPNAG) to wild-type E. coli cells, generating robust biofilms on the timescale of hours. In this way, we managed to uncouple upstream regulatory processes and matrix preparatory phase of biofilm formation, focusing specifically on the latter part. By using a powerful genome-wide technology, we identified the genes and pathways involved in sPNAG-based biofilm formation. Our results revealed that structural interactions between sPNAG and surface structures such as lipopolysaccharides are the crucial determinants of biofilm formation and that multiple pathways including acid-tolerance, capsule biosynthesis, and regulation of cell morphology modulate this phenotype.

"Mutations in Pten-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are linked to early-onset familial Parkinson's disease (FPD). PINK1 has previously been implicated in mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics, quality control, and electron transport chain function. However, it is not clear how these processes are interconnected and whether they are sufficient to explain all aspects of PINK1 pathogenesis. Here we show that PINK1 also controls mitochondrial motility. In Drosophila, downregulation of dMiro or other components of the mitochondrial transport machinery rescued dPINK1 mutant phenotypes in the muscle and dopaminergic (DA) neurons, whereas dMiro overexpression alone caused DA neuron loss. dMiro protein level was increased in dPINK1 mutant but decreased in dPINK1 or dParkin overexpression conditions. In Drosophila larval motor neurons, overexpression of dPINK1 inhibited axonal mitochondria transport in both anterograde and retrograde directions, whereas dPINK1 knockdown promoted anterograde transport. In HeLa cells, overexpressed hPINK1 worked together with hParkin, another FPD gene, to regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of hMiro1 and hMiro2, apparently in a Ser-156 phosphorylation-independent manner. Also in HeLa cells, loss of hMiro promoted the perinuclear clustering of mitochondria and facilitated autophagy of damaged mitochondria, effects previously associated with activation of the PINK1/Parkin pathway. These newly identified functions of PINK1/Parkin and Miro in mitochondrial transport and mitophagy contribute to our understanding of the complex interplays in mitochondrial quality control that are critically involved in PD pathogenesis, and they may explain the peripheral neuropathy symptoms seen in some PD patients carrying particular PINK1 or Parkin mutations. Moreover, the different effects of loss of PINK1 function on Miro protein level in Drosophila and mouse cells may offer one explanation of the distinct phenotypic manifestations of PINK1 mutants in these two species.
","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. It mainly affects movement in elderly people and was traditionally considered a sporadic disease with no known cause. Discoveries of genes associated with familial PD (FPD) have demonstrated that PD pathogenesis can be significantly influenced by an individual's genetic makeup. Understanding the functions of these FPD genes will allow better understanding of the sporadic PD cases. PINK1 and Parkin are genes associated with FPD that affect patients at an early age. Mutations in PINK1 and Parkin lead to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, as a result of impairments of the mitochondrial quality control system. However, the mechanism of PINK1/Parkin action remains poorly understood. Here we show that PINK1 and Parkin act together to regulate Miro, a key component of the mitochondrial transport machinery, and that altered activities of PINK1 cause aberrant mitochondrial transport. Regulation of mitochondrial transport may be a critical aspect of the mechanisms by which the PINK1/Parkin pathway governs mitochondrial quality control. Dysfunction of this process could contribute to the loss of DA neurons, the cardinal feature of PD, as well as the peripheral neuropathy symptom associated with particular PINK1 or Parkin mutations.

"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to search for genetic loci that underlie human disease. Another goal is to predict disease risk for different individuals given their genetic sequence. Such predictions could either be used as a “black box” in order to promote changes in life-style and screening for early diagnosis, or as a model that can be studied to better understand the mechanism of the disease. Current methods for risk prediction typically rank single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by the p-value of their association with the disease, and use the top-associated SNPs as input to a classification algorithm. However, the predictive power of such methods is relatively poor. To improve the predictive power, we devised BootRank, which uses bootstrapping in order to obtain a robust prioritization of SNPs for use in predictive models. We show that BootRank improves the ability to predict disease risk of unseen individuals in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data and results in a more robust set of SNPs and a larger number of enriched pathways being associated with the different diseases. Finally, we show that combining BootRank with seven different classification algorithms improves performance compared to previous studies that used the WTCCC data. Notably, diseases for which BootRank results in the largest improvements were recently shown to have more heritability than previously thought, likely due to contributions from variants with low minimum allele frequency (MAF), suggesting that BootRank can be beneficial in cases where SNPs affecting the disease are poorly tagged or have low MAF. Overall, our results show that improving disease risk prediction from genotypic information may be a tangible goal, with potential implications for personalized disease screening and treatment.

"Third-stage larvae (L3) of the canine hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, undergo arrested development preceding transmission to a host. Many of the mRNAs up-regulated at this stage are likely to encode proteins that facilitate the transition from a free-living to a parasitic larva. The initial phase of mammalian host invasion by A. caninum L3 (herein termed “activation”) can be mimicked in vitro by culturing L3 in serum-containing medium.
The mRNAs differentially transcribed between activated and non-activated L3 were identified by suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH). The analysis of these mRNAs on a custom oligonucleotide microarray printed with the SSH expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and publicly available A. caninum ESTs (non-subtracted) yielded 602 differentially expressed mRNAs, of which the most highly represented sequences encoded members of the pathogenesis-related protein (PRP) superfamily and proteases. Comparison of these A. caninum mRNAs with those of Caenorhabditis elegans larvae exiting from developmental (dauer) arrest demonstrated unexpectedly large differences in gene ontology profiles. C. elegans dauer exiting L3 up-regulated expression of mostly intracellular molecules involved in growth and development. Such mRNAs are virtually absent from activated hookworm larvae, and instead are over-represented by mRNAs encoding extracellular proteins with putative roles in host-parasite interactions.
Although this should not invalidate C. elegans dauer exit as a model for hookworm activation, it highlights the limitations of this free-living nematode as a model organism for the transition of nematode larvae from a free-living to a parasitic state.
","Hookworms are soil-transmitted nematodes that parasitize hundreds of millions of people in developing countries. Here we describe the genes expressed when hookworm larvae make the transition from a developmentally arrested free-living form to a tissue-penetrating parasitic stage. Ancylostoma caninum can be “tricked” into thinking it has penetrated host skin by incubating free-living larvae in host serum – this is called “activation”. To comprehensively identify genes involved in activation, we used suppressive subtractive hybridization to clone genes that were up- or down-regulated in activated larvae, with a particular focus on up-regulated genes. The subtracted genes, as well as randomly sequenced (non-subtracted) genes from public databases were then printed on a microarray to further explore differential expression. We compared predicted gene functions between activated hookworms and the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, exiting developmental arrest (dauer), and found enormous differences in the types of genes expressed. Genes encoding secreted proteins involved in parasitism were over-represented in activated hookworms whereas genes involved in growth and development dominated in C. elegans exiting dauer. Our data implies that C. elegans dauer exit is not a reliable model for exit from developmental arrest of hookworm larvae. Many of these genes likely play critical roles in host-parasite interactions, and are therefore worthy of pursuit for vaccine and drug development.

"Maintaining high levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a challenge across settings and populations. Understanding the relative importance of different barriers to adherence will help inform the targeting of different interventions and future research priorities.
We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsychINFO from 01 January 1997 to 31 March 2016 for studies reporting barriers to adherence to ART. We calculated pooled proportions of reported barriers to adherence per age group (adults, adolescents, and children). We included data from 125 studies that provided information about adherence barriers for 17,061 adults, 1,099 children, and 856 adolescents. We assessed differences according to geographical location and level of economic development. The most frequently reported individual barriers included forgetting (adults 41.4%, 95% CI 37.3%–45.4%; adolescents 63.1%, 95% CI 46.3%–80.0%; children/caregivers 29.2%, 95% CI 20.1%–38.4%), being away from home (adults 30.4%, 95% CI 25.5%–35.2%; adolescents 40.7%, 95% CI 25.7%–55.6%; children/caregivers 18.5%, 95% CI 10.3%–26.8%), and a change to daily routine (adults 28.0%, 95% CI 20.9%–35.0%; adolescents 32.4%, 95% CI 0%–75.0%; children/caregivers 26.3%, 95% CI 15.3%–37.4%). Depression was reported as a barrier to adherence by more than 15% of patients across all age categories (adults 15.5%, 95% CI 12.8%–18.3%; adolescents 25.7%, 95% CI 17.7%–33.6%; children 15.1%, 95% CI 3.9%–26.3%), while alcohol/substance misuse was commonly reported by adults (12.9%, 95% CI 9.7%–16.1%) and adolescents (28.8%, 95% CI 11.8%–45.8%). Secrecy/stigma was a commonly cited barrier to adherence, reported by more than 10% of adults and children across all regions (adults 13.6%, 95% CI 11.9%–15.3%; children/caregivers 22.3%, 95% CI 10.2%–34.5%). Among adults, feeling sick (15.9%, 95% CI 13.0%–18.8%) was a more commonly cited barrier to adherence than feeling well (9.3%, 95% CI 7.2%–11.4%). Health service–related barriers, including distance to clinic (adults 17.5%, 95% CI 13.0%–21.9%) and stock outs (adults 16.1%, 95% CI 11.7%–20.4%), were also frequently reported. Limitations of this review relate to the fact that included studies differed in approaches to assessing adherence barriers and included variable durations of follow up. Studies that report self-reported adherence will likely underestimate the frequency of non-adherence. For children, barriers were mainly reported by caregivers, which may not correspond to the most important barriers faced by children.
Patients on ART face multiple barriers to adherence, and no single intervention will be sufficient to ensure that high levels of adherence to treatment and virological suppression are sustained. For maximum efficacy, health providers should consider a more triaged approach that first identifies patients at risk of poor adherence and then seeks to establish the support that is needed to overcome the most important barriers to adherence.
","Despite more than two decades of research on adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and more than 17 million HIV-positive individuals on treatment, adherence to ART remains a major challenge.
This review aimed to assess the most frequently reported barriers to adherence by patients experiencing adherence challenges.
Published data from 125 studies on patient-reported barriers to adherence were systematically reviewed and analyzed by age group.
The most frequently reported individual barriers across all age groups included forgetting, being away from home, and a change to daily routine. Depression was reported as a barrier to adherence by more than 15% of patients across all age categories, while alcohol/substance misuse was commonly reported as a barrier by adults and adolescents.
With respect to contextual barriers, secrecy/stigma was a commonly cited barrier to adherence, reported by more than 10% of patients across all regions.
Health service–related barriers were frequently reported, including distance to clinic and stock outs.
Evidence-based interventions exist that may address many of the most common patient-reported barriers to adherence.
However, no single intervention will be sufficient to ensure that high levels of adherence to treatment and virological suppression are sustained.
Health providers should consider a more triaged approach that first identifies patients at risk of poor adherence and then seeks to establish the support that is needed to overcome the most important barriers to adherence.
Several key health service improvements are also required to ensure that patients are able to consistently access ART.

"North-west Ethiopia faces the highest burden world-wide of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV co-infection. VL-HIV co-infected patients have higher (initial) parasitological failure and relapse rates than HIV-negative VL patients. Whereas secondary prophylaxis reduces the relapse rate, parasitological failure rates remain high with the available antileishmanial drugs, especially when administered as monotherapy. We aimed to determine the initial effectiveness (parasitologically-confirmed cure) of a combination of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) and miltefosine for treatment of VL in HIV co-infected patients.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a Médecins Sans Frontières—supported health center in north-west Ethiopia. We included VL-HIV co-infected adults, treated for VL between January 2011 and August 2014, with AmBisome infusion (30 mg/kg total dose) and miltefosine orally for 28 days (100 mg/day). Proportions of initial treatment outcome categories were calculated. Predictors of initial parasitological failure and of death were determined using multivariable logistic regression. Of the 173 patients included, 170 (98.3%) were male and the median age was 32 years. The proportion of patients with primary VL (48.0%) and relapse VL (52.0%) were similar. The majority had advanced HIV disease (n = 111; 73.5%) and were on antiretroviral therapy prior to VL diagnosis (n = 106; 64.2%). Initial cure rate was 83.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.6–88.6); death rate 12.7% (95% CI, 8.5–18.5) and parasitological failure rate 3.5% (95% CI, 1.6–7.4). Tuberculosis co-infection at VL diagnosis was predictive of parasitological failure (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 8.14; p = 0.02). Predictors of death were age >40 years (aOR, 5.10; p = 0.009), hemoglobin ≤6.5 g/dL (aOR, 5.20; p = 0.002) and primary VL (aOR, 8.33; p = 0.001).
Initial parasitological failure rates were very low with AmBisome and miltefosine combination therapy. This regimen seems a suitable treatment option. Knowledge of predictors of poor outcome may facilitate better management. These findings remain to be confirmed in clinical trials.

"An epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) illness that occurred in July 2007 on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia prompted entomological studies to identify both the primary vector(s) involved in transmission and the ecological parameters contributing to the outbreak. Larval and pupal surveys were performed to identify the major containers serving as oviposition habitat for the likely vector(s). Adult mosquitoes were also collected by backpack aspiration, light trap, and gravid traps at select sites around the capital city. The predominant species found on the island was Aedes (Stegomyia) hensilli. No virus isolates were obtained from the adult field material collected, nor did any of the immature mosquitoes that were allowed to emerge to adulthood contain viable virus or nucleic acid. Therefore, laboratory studies of the probable vector, Ae. hensilli, were undertaken to determine the likelihood of this species serving as a vector for Zika virus and other arboviruses. Infection rates of up to 86%, 62%, and 20% and dissemination rates of 23%, 80%, and 17% for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue-2 viruses respectively, were found supporting the possibility that this species served as a vector during the Zika outbreak and that it could play a role in transmitting other medically important arboviruses.
","Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) cause significant human morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Zika virus, which is reported to be transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) species mosquitoes, caused an outbreak on the island of Yap, in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2007. This was the first described outbreak of Zika in Oceania, which has had several arbovirus outbreaks in the past. Diagnosing the outbreak was difficult due to the similarity in clinical symptoms between disease caused by Zika virus and other viruses. This work describes the efforts to identify the mosquito species that were responsible for transmission of the virus. While no virus was isolated from any species of mosquito collected during the current study, the predominant species found was Aedes hensilli and through the complementary laboratory studies, this mosquito was implicated as a probable vector for Zika virus. In addition, this species was found to be susceptible to both the medically important dengue-2 and chikungunya viruses.

"Helminth infections are highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical countries, coexisting in Chagas disease endemic areas. Helminth infections in humans may modulate the host immune system, changing the Th1/Th2 polarization. This immunological disturbance could modify the immune response to other infections. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between clinical, microbiological and epidemiological characteristics of Chagas disease patients, with the presence of helminth infection.
A prospective observational study was conducted at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain). Inclusion criteria were: age over 18 years, diagnosis of Chagas disease, and not having received specific treatment for Chagas disease previously to the inclusion. The study protocol included Chagas disease assessment (cardiac and digestive evaluation, detection of T. cruzi DNA measured by PCR in peripheral blood), and helminth infection diagnosis (detection of IgG anti-Strongyloides stercoralis by ELISA, microscopic examination of stool samples from three different days, and specific faecal culture for S. stercoralis larvae).
Overall, 65 patients were included, median age was 38 years, 75.4% were women and most of them came from Bolivia. Cardiac and digestive involvement was present in 18.5% and 27.7% of patients respectively. T. cruzi PCR was positive in 28 (43.1%) patients. Helminth infection was diagnosed in 12 (18.5%) patients. No differences were observed in clinical and epidemiological characteristics between patients with and without helminth infection. Nevertheless, the proportion of patients with positive T. cruzi PCR was higher among patients with helminth infection compared with patients without helminth infection (75% vs 35.8%, p = 0.021).
We observed a high prevalence of S. stercoralis infection among chronic Chagas disease patients attended in our tropical medicine unit. Strongyloidiasis was associated with significantly higher proportion of positive T. cruzi RT-PCR determined in peripheral blood.
","Helminth infections (viz. Strongyloides stercoralis, hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura) are highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, and some of these infections may persist in the human host for many years after leaving the endemic area. It is known that helminth infection in humans may modulate the host immune system. This immunological disturbance could modify the immune response to other infections or the antibody production after vaccination. We prospectively studied a group of patients with chronic Chagas disease, with the aim of evaluate the impact of helminth co-infection in the clinical manifestations and microbiological features of Chagas disease. We observed a high prevalence of helminth infection (mostly due to S. stercoralis infection) among chronic Chagas disease patients attended in our tropical medicine unit. Strongyloidiasis was associated with significantly higher proportion of positive T. cruzi RT-PCR determined in peripheral blood. These data increase the scarce available information to understand the role of PCR techniques in the management of Chagas disease patients. Further studies are needed to deepen and confirm this interesting relationship.

"Some symbiotic bacteria cause remarkable reproductive phenotypes like cytoplasmic incompatibility and male-killing in their host insects. Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these symbiont-induced reproductive pathologies are of great interest but poorly understood. In this study, Drosophila melanogaster and its native Spiroplasma symbiont strain MSRO were investigated as to how the host's molecular, cellular and morphogenetic pathways are involved in the symbiont-induced male-killing during embryogenesis. TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining, anti-cleaved-Caspase-3 antibody staining, and apoptosis-deficient mutant analysis unequivocally demonstrated that the host's apoptotic pathway is involved in Spiroplasma-induced male-specific embryonic cell death. Double-staining with TUNEL and an antibody recognizing epidermal marker showed that embryonic epithelium is the main target of Spiroplasma-induced male-specific apoptosis. Immunostaining with antibodies against markers of differentiated and precursor neural cells visualized severe neural defects specifically in Spiroplasma-infected male embryos as reported in previous studies. However, few TUNEL signals were detected in the degenerate nervous tissues of male embryos, and the Spiroplasma-induced neural defects in male embryos were not suppressed in an apoptosis-deficient host mutant. These results suggest the possibility that the apoptosis-dependent epidermal cell death and the apoptosis-independent neural malformation may represent different mechanisms underlying the Spiroplasma-induced male-killing. Despite the male-specific progressive embryonic abnormality, Spiroplasma titers remained almost constant throughout the observed stages of embryonic development and across male and female embryos. Strikingly, a few Spiroplasma-infected embryos exhibited gynandromorphism, wherein apoptotic cell death was restricted to male cells. These observations suggest that neither quantity nor proliferation of Spiroplasma cells but some Spiroplasma-derived factor(s) may be responsible for the expression of the male-killing phenotype.
","Symbiotic bacteria are ubiquitously associated with diverse insects, and affect their host biology in a variety of ways. In Drosophila fruit flies, infection with Spiroplasma symbionts often causes male-specific embryonic mortality, resulting in the production of all-female offspring. This striking phenotype is called “male-killing”, whose underlying mechanisms are of great interest. Here we investigated Drosophila melanogaster and its native Spiroplasma symbiont strain to understand how the host's molecular, cellular and morphogenetic pathways are involved in the symbiont-induced male-killing. Specifically in Spiroplasma-infected male embryos, pathogenic phenotypes including massive cell death throughout the body and neural malformation were observed. We unequivocally identified that the male-specific cell death preferentially occurs in the embryonic epithelium via the host's apoptotic pathway. Meanwhile, we found that, unexpectedly, the male-specific neural defects occur independently of host's apoptosis, suggesting that at least two different mechanisms may be involved in the Spiroplasma-induced male-killing. Also unexpected was the finding that Spiroplasma titers are almost constant throughout embryogenesis irrespective of sex despite the male-specific severe apoptosis. We serendipitously found Spiroplasma-infected sexual mosaic embryos, wherein apoptosis was associated with male cells, which suggests that some Spiroplasma-derived factor(s) may selectively act on male cells and cause male-killing.

"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is an opportunistic pathogen that causes otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. The progression to this pathogenic lifestyle is preceded by asymptomatic colonization of the nasopharynx. This colonization is associated with biofilm formation; the competence pathway influences the structure and stability of biofilms. However, the molecules that link the competence pathway to biofilm formation are unknown. Here, we describe a new competence-induced gene, called briC, and demonstrate that its product promotes biofilm development and stimulates colonization in a murine model. We show that expression of briC is induced by the master regulator of competence, ComE. Whereas briC does not substantially influence early biofilm development on abiotic surfaces, it significantly impacts later stages of biofilm development. Specifically, briC expression leads to increases in biofilm biomass and thickness at 72h. Consistent with the role of biofilms in colonization, briC promotes nasopharyngeal colonization in the murine model. The function of BriC appears to be conserved across pneumococci, as comparative genomics reveal that briC is widespread across isolates. Surprisingly, many isolates, including strains from clinically important PMEN1 and PMEN14 lineages, which are widely associated with colonization, encode a long briC promoter. This long form captures an instance of genomic plasticity and functions as a competence-independent expression enhancer that may serve as a precocious point of entry into this otherwise competence-regulated pathway. Moreover, overexpression of briC by the long promoter fully rescues the comE-deletion induced biofilm defect in vitro, and partially in vivo. These findings indicate that BriC may bypass the influence of competence in biofilm development and that such a pathway may be active in a subset of pneumococcal lineages. In conclusion, BriC is a part of the complex molecular network that connects signaling of the competence pathway to biofilm development and colonization.
","Pneumococcal biofilms occur in chronic otitis media, chronic rhinosinusitis, and nasopharyngeal colonization. These biofilms are an important component of pneumococcal epidemiology, particularly in influencing transmission, maintenance of asymptomatic colonization, and development of disease. The transcriptional program initiated via signaling of the competence pathway is critical for productive biofilm formation and is a strong contributor of pneumococcal infection and adaptation. In this study, we have identified BriC, a previously uncharacterized peptide that serves as a bridge between the competence pathway and biofilm development. We show that briC is induced by ComE, the master regulator of competence, and promotes biofilm development. Moreover, our studies in the murine model demonstrate that BriC is a novel colonization enhancer. Our studies of briC regulation capture an instance of genomic plasticity, where natural variation in the briC promoter sequence reveals the existence of an additional competence-independent regulatory unit. This natural variation may be able to modify the extent to which competence contributes to biofilm development and to nasopharyngeal colonization across different pneumococcal lineages. In summary, this study introduces a colonization factor and reveals a molecular link between competence and biofilm development.

"Cytoadhesion of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes to gC1qR has been associated with severe malaria, but the parasite ligand involved is currently unknown. To assess if binding to gC1qR is mediated through the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family, we analyzed by static binding assays and qPCR the cytoadhesion and var gene transcriptional profile of 86 P. falciparum isolates from Mozambican children with severe and uncomplicated malaria, as well as of a P. falciparum 3D7 line selected for binding to gC1qR (Pf3D7gC1qR). Transcript levels of DC8 correlated positively with cytoadhesion to gC1qR (rho = 0.287, P = 0.007), were higher in isolates from children with severe anemia than with uncomplicated malaria, as well as in isolates from Europeans presenting a first episode of malaria (n = 21) than Mozambican adults (n = 25), and were associated with an increased IgG recognition of infected erythrocytes by flow cytometry. Pf3D7gC1qR overexpressed the DC8 type PFD0020c (5.3-fold transcript levels relative to Seryl-tRNA-synthetase gene) compared to the unselected line (0.001-fold). DBLβ12 from PFD0020c bound to gC1qR in ELISA-based binding assays and polyclonal antibodies against this domain were able to inhibit binding to gC1qR of Pf3D7gC1qR and four Mozambican P. falciparum isolates by 50%. Our results show that DC8-type PfEMP1s mediate binding to gC1qR through conserved surface epitopes in DBLβ12 domain which can be inhibited by strain-transcending functional antibodies. This study supports a key role for gC1qR in malaria-associated endovascular pathogenesis and suggests the feasibility of designing interventions against severe malaria targeting this specific interaction.
","Plasmodium falciparum sequesters in vital organs. This phenomenon mediated by cytoadhesion of infected-erythrocytes to host receptors in the microvasculature, contributes to the development of severe malaria. Although cytoadhesion to Endothelial Protein-C Receptor has a central role in severe malaria, other host receptors are also likely to be involved. Our results generated by the analysis of P. falciparum isolates from Mozambican patients and laboratory parasite lines indicate that a specific domain (DBLβ12) from DC8-type PfEMP1s can bind to the human receptor gC1qR, previously associated with severe malaria. Our findings revealed that antibodies against PfEMP1 could provide strain-transcending inhibition of gC1qR-binding. Overall, these results support a key role for the adhesion to gC1qR in malaria-associated endovascular pathogenesis and the feasibility of new interventions targeting this specific interaction.

"The phylogeographic population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis suggests local adaptation to sympatric human populations. We hypothesized that HIV infection, which induces immunodeficiency, will alter the sympatric relationship between M. tuberculosis and its human host. To test this hypothesis, we performed a nine-year nation-wide molecular-epidemiological study of HIV–infected and HIV–negative patients with tuberculosis (TB) between 2000 and 2008 in Switzerland. We analyzed 518 TB patients of whom 112 (21.6%) were HIV–infected and 233 (45.0%) were born in Europe. We found that among European-born TB patients, recent transmission was more likely to occur in sympatric compared to allopatric host–pathogen combinations (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7.5, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.21–infinity, p = 0.03). HIV infection was significantly associated with TB caused by an allopatric (as opposed to sympatric) M. tuberculosis lineage (OR 7.0, 95% CI 2.5–19.1, p<0.0001). This association remained when adjusting for frequent travelling, contact with foreigners, age, sex, and country of birth (adjusted OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.5–20.8, p = 0.01). Moreover, it became stronger with greater immunosuppression as defined by CD4 T-cell depletion and was not the result of increased social mixing in HIV–infected patients. Our observation was replicated in a second independent panel of 440 M. tuberculosis strains collected during a population-based study in the Canton of Bern between 1991 and 2011. In summary, these findings support a model for TB in which the stable relationship between the human host and its locally adapted M. tuberculosis is disrupted by HIV infection.
","Human tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis kills 1.5 million people each year. M. tuberculosis has been affecting humans for millennia, suggesting that different strain lineages may be adapted to specific human populations. The combination of a particular strain lineage and its corresponding patient population can be classified as sympatric (e.g. Euro-American lineage in Europeans) or allopatric (e.g. East-Asian lineage in Europeans). We hypothesized that infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which impairs the human immune system, will interfere with this host–pathogen relationship. We performed a nation-wide molecular-epidemiological study of HIV–infected and HIV–negative TB patients between 2000 and 2008 in Switzerland. We found that HIV infection was associated with the less adapted allopatric lineages among patients born in Europe, and this was not explained by social or other patient factors such as increased social mixing in HIV–infected individuals. Strikingly, the association between HIV infection and less adapted M. tuberculosis lineages was stronger in patients with more pronounced immunodeficiency. Our observation was replicated in a second independent panel of M. tuberculosis strains collected during a population-based study in the Canton of Bern. In summary, our study provides evidence that the sympatric host–pathogen relationship in TB is disrupted by HIV infection.

"Allocation of goods is a key feature in defining the connection between the individual and the collective scale in any society. Both the process by which goods are to be distributed, and the resulting allocation to the members of the society may affect the success of the population as a whole. One of the most striking natural examples of a highly successful cooperative society is the ant colony which often acts as a single superorganism. In particular, each individual within the ant colony has a “communal stomach” which is used to store and share food with the other colony members by mouth to mouth feeding. Sharing food between communal stomachs allows the colony as a whole to get its food requirements and, more so, allows each individual within the colony to reach its nutritional intake target. The vast majority of colony members do not forage independently but obtain their food through secondary interactions in which food is exchanged between individuals. The global effect of this exchange is not well understood. To gain better understanding into this process we used fluorescence imaging to measure how food from a single external source is distributed and mixed within a Camponotus sanctus ant colony. Using entropic measures to quantify food-blending, we show that while collected food flows into all parts of the colony it mixes only partly. We show that mixing is controlled by the ants’ interaction rule which implies that only a fraction of the maximal potential is actually transferred. This rule leads to a robust blending process: i.e., neither the exact food volume that is transferred, nor the interaction schedule are essential to generate the global outcome. Finally, we show how the ants’ interaction rules may optimize a trade-off between fast dissemination and efficient mixing. Our results regarding the distribution of a single food source provide a baseline for future studies on distributed regulation of multiple food sources in social insect colonies.
","We study how food is distributed in colonies of ants. Food collected by a small fraction of ants is distributed throughout the colony through a series of mouth-to-mouth interactions. An interesting interplay exists between food dissemination and food mixing within the colony. High levels of dissemination are important as they ensure that any food type is available to any ant. On the other hand, high dissemination induces homogenization which reduces the required variety of nutritional choices within the colony. Tracking fluorescent-labelled food and interpreting the results within the concepts of information theory, we show that food collected by each forager reaches almost every ant in the colony. Nonetheless, it is not homogenized across workers, resulting in a limited level of mixing. We suggest that the difference in food mixture held by each individuals can provide ants with the potential to control their nutritional intake by interacting with different partners.

"Mutualistic cooperation often requires multiple individuals to behave in a coordinated fashion. Hence, while the evolutionary stability of mutualistic cooperation poses no particular theoretical difficulty, its evolutionary emergence faces a chicken and egg problem: an individual cannot benefit from cooperating unless other individuals already do so. Here, we use evolutionary robotic simulations to study the consequences of this problem for the evolution of cooperation. In contrast with standard game-theoretic results, we find that the transition from solitary to cooperative strategies is very unlikely, whether interacting individuals are genetically related (cooperation evolves in 20% of all simulations) or unrelated (only 3% of all simulations). We also observe that successful cooperation between individuals requires the evolution of a specific and rather complex behaviour. This behavioural complexity creates a large fitness valley between solitary and cooperative strategies, making the evolutionary transition difficult. These results reveal the need for research on biological mechanisms which may facilitate this transition.
","Mutualistic behaviours wherein several individuals act together for a common benefit, such as a collective hunt, are often deemed of minor interest by theoreticians in evolutionary biology. These behaviours benefit all the individuals involved, and therefore, so the argument goes, their evolution is straightforward. However, mutualistic behaviours do pose a specific kind of evolutionary problem: they require the coordination of several partners. Indeed, a single individual expressing a preference for cooperation cannot benefit if others wish to remain solitary. Here we use simulations in evolutionary robotics to study the consequences of this problem. We show that it constitutes a far more serious obstacle for the evolution of cooperation than was previously thought on the basis of game theoretical analyses. We find that the transition from solitary to cooperative strategies is very unlikely, and we also observe that successful cooperation requires the evolution of a specific and rather complex behaviour, necessary for individuals to coordinate with each other. This reveals the critical role of the practical mechanics of behaviour in evolution.

"Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs can be promising diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for various cancers. In this study, we identified a novel miRNA, miR-3607-3p, and its targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression of miR-3607-3p was measured and its correlation with patient prognosis was determined. Ectopic expression in NSCLC cells, xenografts, and metastasis models was used to evaluate the effects of miR-3607-3p on proliferation and migration of NSCLC. Luciferase assay and western blotting were performed to validate the potential targets of miR-3607-3p after preliminary screening by microarray analysis and computer-aided algorithms. We demonstrated that miR-3607-3p was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and that miR-3607-3p might act as an independent predictor for overall survival in NSCLC. Moreover, serum miR-3607-3p may be a novel and stable marker for NSCLC. We found that overexpression of miR-3607-3p inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and hampered the cell cycle of NSCLC cell lines in vitro. Our results suggested that miR-3607-3p directly targets TGFBR1 and CCNE2. In accordance with in vitro studies, we confirmed that miR-3607-3p functions as a potent suppressor miRNA of NSCLC. We showed that miR-3607-3p agomir could reduce tumor growth and inhibit TGFBR1 and CCNE2 protein expression. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-3607-3p can inhibit NSCLC cell growth and metastasis by targeting TGFBR1 and CCNE2 protein expression, and provide new evidence of miR-3607-3p as a potential non-invasive biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC.
","We first showed downregulation of miR-3607-3p in NSCLC tissues and demonstrated that miR-3607-3p may act as an independent predictor of overall survival. Serum miR-3607-3p may be a novel marker of patients with NSCLC. We further found that miR-3607-3p possesses the potency to suppress NSCLC growth and metastasis and induce cell cycle arrest by regulating TGFBR1 and CCNE2. Importantly, agomiR-3607-3p could reduce tumor growth and lung and brain metastasis and inhibit TGFBR1 and CCNE2 protein expression. Our findings suggest that miR-3607-3p is a tumor suppressor in NSCLC and holds promise as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.

"Genomic rearrangements (gross chromosomal rearrangements, GCRs) threatens genome integrity and cause cell death or tumor formation. At the terminus of linear chromosomes, a telomere-binding protein complex, called shelterin, ensures chromosome stability by preventing chromosome end-to-end fusions and regulating telomere length homeostasis. As such, shelterin-mediated telomere functions play a pivotal role in suppressing GCR formation. However, it remains unclear whether the shelterin proteins play any direct role in inhibiting GCR at non-telomeric regions. Here, we have established a GCR assay for the first time in fission yeast and measured GCR rates in various mutants. We found that fission yeast cells lacking shelterin components Taz1 or Rap1 (mammalian TRF1/2 or RAP1 homologues, respectively) showed higher GCR rates compared to wild-type, accumulating large chromosome deletions. Genetic dissection of Rap1 revealed that Rap1 contributes to inhibiting GCRs via two independent pathways. The N-terminal BRCT-domain promotes faithful DSB repair, as determined by I-SceI-mediated DSB-induction experiments; moreover, association with Poz1 mediated by the central Poz1-binding domain regulates telomerase accessibility to DSBs, leading to suppression of de novo telomere additions. Our data highlight unappreciated functions of the shelterin components Taz1 and Rap1 in maintaining genome stability, specifically by preventing non-telomeric GCRs.
","Tips of chromosomes, telomeres, are bound and protected by a telomere-binding protein complex called shelterin. Most previous studies focused on shelterin’s telomere-specific role, and its general role in genome maintenance has not been explored extensively. In this study, we first set up an assay measuring the spontaneous formation rate per cell division of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) in fission yeast. We found that the rate of GCRs is elevated in mutants defective for shelterin components Taz1 or Rap1. Detailed genetic experiments revealed unexpectedly that Taz1 and Rap1 have a novel role in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and suppressing GCRs at non-telomeric regions. Given that shelterin components are conserved between fission yeast and humans, future studies are warranted to test whether shelterin dysfunction leads to genome-wide GCRs, which are frequently observed in cancers.

"Bacterial genes that confer crucial phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance, can spread horizontally by residing on mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Although many mobile genes provide strong benefits to their hosts, the fitness consequences of the process of transfer itself are less clear. In previous studies, transfer has been interpreted as a parasitic trait of the MGEs because of its costs to the host but also as a trait benefiting host populations through the sharing of a common gene pool. Here, we show that costly donation is an altruistic act when it spreads beneficial MGEs favoured when it increases the inclusive fitness of donor ability alleles. We show mathematically that donor ability can be selected when relatedness at the locus modulating transfer is sufficiently high between donor and recipients, ensuring high frequency of transfer between cells sharing donor alleles. We further experimentally demonstrate that either population structure or discrimination in transfer can increase relatedness to a level selecting for chromosomal transfer alleles. Both mechanisms are likely to occur in natural environments. The simple process of strong dilution can create sufficient population structure to select for donor ability. Another mechanism observed in natural isolates, discrimination in transfer, can emerge through coselection of transfer and discrimination alleles. Our work shows that horizontal gene transfer in bacteria can be promoted by bacterial hosts themselves and not only by MGEs. In the longer term, the success of cells bearing beneficial MGEs combined with biased transfer leads to an association between high donor ability, discrimination, and mobile beneficial genes. However, in conditions that do not select for altruism, host bacteria promoting transfer are outcompeted by hosts with lower transfer rate, an aspect that could be relevant in the fight against the spread of antibiotic resistance.
","In bacteria, genes can move between cells, sometimes with the donor host cell actively involved in the gene transfer mechanisms. This movement of genes is called horizontal gene transfer, and it increases the prevalence of mobile genes in bacterial populations. However, it is not clear if donor host cells benefit from gene spread, or are simply exploited by selfish genes. Here, we show with both modelling and experiments that for the donor host, investing in the transfer of beneficial genes—such as those conferring antibiotic resistance—can be understood as an altruistic behaviour. This behaviour is costly to the donor but beneficial to recipients and can be selected for if a sufficient proportion of recipient cells share the donors’ transfer allele. Preferential transfer from donors towards recipients that share this allele occurs when dispersal is limited or if discrimination mechanisms are present. Our work suggests that both processes are likely to be widespread in nature, promoting horizontal gene spread by host donor cells. As many antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes are mobile, our work further implies that the spread of harmful traits among human pathogens may be modulated by host bacteria in a direction that depends on the bacterial ability to transfer the traits specifically to their kind.

"The sepsis-induced cytokine storm leads to severe lymphopenia and reduced effector capacity of remaining/surviving cells. This results in a prolonged state of immunoparalysis, that contributes to enhanced morbidity/mortality of sepsis survivors upon secondary infection. The impact of sepsis on several lymphoid subsets has been characterized, yet its impact on NK-cells remains underappreciated–despite their critical role in controlling infection(s). Here, we observed numerical loss of NK-cells in multiple tissues after cecal-ligation-and-puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. To elucidate the sepsis-induced lesions in surviving NK-cells, transcriptional profiles were evaluated and indicated changes consistent with impaired effector functionality. A corresponding deficit in NK-cell capacity to produce effector molecules following secondary infection and/or cytokine stimulation (IL-12,IL-18) further suggested a sepsis-induced NK-cell intrinsic impairment. To specifically probe NK-cell receptor-mediated function, the activating Ly49H receptor, that recognizes the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) m157 protein, served as a model receptor. Although relative expression of Ly49H receptor did not change, the number of Ly49H+ NK-cells in CLP hosts was reduced leading to impaired in vivo cytotoxicity and the capacity of NK-cells (on per-cell basis) to perform Ly49H-mediated degranulation, killing, and effector molecule production in vitro was also severely reduced. Mechanistically, Ly49H adaptor protein (DAP12) activation and clustering, assessed by TIRF microscopy, was compromised. This was further associated with diminished AKT phosphorylation and capacity to flux calcium following receptor stimulation. Importantly, DAP12 overexpression in NK-cells restored Ly49H/D receptors-mediated effector functions in CLP hosts. Finally, as a consequence of sepsis-dependent numerical and functional lesions in Ly49H+ NK-cells, host capacity to control MCMV infection was significantly impaired. Importantly, IL-2 complex (IL-2c) therapy after CLP improved numbers but not a function of NK-cells leading to enhanced immunity to MCMV challenge. Thus, the sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state includes numerical and NK-cell-intrinsic functional impairments, an instructive notion for future studies aimed in restoring NK-cell immunity in sepsis survivors.
","Sepsis is an exaggerated host response to infection that can initially lead to significant morbidity/mortality and a long-lasting state of immunoparalysis in sepsis survivors. Sepsis-induced immunoparalysis functionally impairs numerous lymphocyte populations, including NK-cells. However, the scope and underlying mechanisms of NK-cell impairment and the consequences for NK-cell-mediated pathogen control remain underappreciated. NK-cells contribute to early host control of pathogens through a balance of activating and inhibitory receptors, and alterations in the number and capacity of NK-cells to exert receptor-mediated immunity can lead to dramatic impairment in host control of infection. The present study defines sepsis-induced numerical and cell-intrinsic functional impairments in NK-cell response to cytokine stimulation and receptor signaling that contribute to impaired host capacity to mount NK-cell-mediated effector responses and provide protection to bacterial and/or viral pathogens. Impairments in receptor signaling were due to reduced expression of adaptor protein DAP12. Importantly, the diminished ability of NK-cells from CLP hosts to provide anti-viral (MCMV) immunity is partially restored by IL-2 complex (IL-2c) therapy, which increased the number, but not function, of protective Ly49H+ NK-cells. Thus, these findings define sepsis-induced changes of the NK-cell compartment and provide insight into potential therapeutic interventions aimed at resolving sepsis-induced immunoparalysis in sepsis survivors.

"Notch (N) signaling is central to the self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs) and other tissue stem cells. Its deregulation compromises tissue homeostasis and contributes to tumorigenesis and other diseases. How N regulates stem cell behavior in health and disease is not well understood. Here we show that N regulates bantam (ban) microRNA to impact cell growth, a process key to NSC maintenance and particularly relied upon by tumor-forming cancer stem cells. Notch signaling directly regulates ban expression at the transcriptional level, and ban in turn feedback regulates N activity through negative regulation of the Notch inhibitor Numb. This feedback regulatory mechanism helps maintain the robustness of N signaling activity and NSC fate. Moreover, we show that a Numb-Myc axis mediates the effects of ban on nucleolar and cellular growth independently or downstream of N. Our results highlight intricate transcriptional as well as translational control mechanisms and feedback regulation in the N signaling network, with important implications for NSC biology and cancer biology.
","Stem cells are functional units in the development, maintenance, and regeneration of tissues in multicellular organisms. Defects in stem cell regulation can compromise tissue homeostasis and result in proliferative or degenerative diseases. Our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating the in vivo behavior of stem cells is still incomplete. The Drosophila central nervous system neural stem cells called neuroblasts have offered an excellent model system for uncovering key mechanisms and player involved in stem cell regulation. Previous genetic studies have uncovered the evolutionarily conserved Numb-N signaling pathway that regulates the self-renewal vs. differentiation choices of the cell fates of NSCs during their asymmetric division. Our understanding of how Numb-N signaling regulates NSC fate is still rudimentary. Recent studies have implicated the involvement of microRNAs in stem cell regulation in both mammalian and Drosophila systems. But the molecular mechanism and logic of miRNA action remain to be delineated. In this study we show that the bantam microRNA is a direct transcriptional target of the N signaling pathway, and that bantam feedback regulates N by negatively regulating the expression of Numb, an inhibitor of N. This feedback regulation of N helps maintain the robustness of NSC fate. We further show that bantam also impinges on a Numb-Myc axis of cell growth regulation, apparently in a N-independent manner. Together, our results highlight the importance of both transcriptional and translational control mechanisms in NSC regulation by the N signaling network. These findings have important implication for our understanding of the basic biology of NSCs and the therapeutic intervention of N-induced cancers.

"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) comprise a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spastic weakness of the lower extremities. We have generated a Drosophila model for HSP type 10 (SPG10), caused by mutations in KIF5A. KIF5A encodes the heavy chain of kinesin-1, a neuronal microtubule motor. Our results imply that SPG10 is not caused by haploinsufficiency but by the loss of endogenous kinesin-1 function due to a selective dominant-negative action of mutant KIF5A on kinesin-1 complexes. We have not found any evidence for an additional, more generalized toxicity of mutant Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) or the affected kinesin-1 complexes. Ectopic expression of Drosophila Khc carrying a human SPG10-associated mutation (N256S) is sufficient to disturb axonal transport and to induce motoneuron disease in Drosophila. Neurofilaments, which have been recently implicated in SPG10 disease manifestation, are absent in arthropods. Impairments in the transport of kinesin-1 cargos different from neurofilaments are thus sufficient to cause HSP–like pathological changes such as axonal swellings, altered structure and function of synapses, behavioral deficits, and increased mortality.
","Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) comprise a group of inherited neurological diseases. The main feature of HSP is progressive stiffness of the lower limbs due to a dysfunction of nerve cells. We study HSP type 10, which is caused by mutations in the neuronal motor protein KIF5A. HSP type 10 is inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner, which means that patients have a normal and a mutated copy of the KIF5A gene. KIF5A plays an important role in neuronal function: it transports cargos to the synapse that can be up to 1 m from the cell body. We use the fruit fly as a model to investigate the role of mutations in KIF5A. Our fly model replicates a central feature of HSP: muscles that are activated by nerve cells that have long cellular processes are more severely impaired. We now address why one mutated copy of KIF5A is sufficient to cause HSP. To date, it has been thought that patients might have HSP because they have insufficient functional KIF5A or because mutated KIF5A disturbs the function of normal KIF5A. We provide evidence for the latter possibility.

"Wolbachia has been deployed in several countries to reduce transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. During releases, Wolbachia-infected females are likely to lay their eggs in local available breeding sites, which might already be colonized by local Aedes sp. mosquitoes. Therefore, there is an urgent need to estimate the deleterious effects of intra and interspecific larval competition on mosquito life history traits, especially on the duration of larval development time, larval mortality and adult size.
Three different mosquito populations were used: Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia (wMelBr strain), wild Ae. aegypti and wild Ae. albopictus. A total of 21 treatments explored intra and interspecific larval competition with varying larval densities, species proportions and food levels. Each treatment had eight replicates with two distinct food levels: 0.25 or 0.50 g of Chitosan and fallen avocado leaves. Overall, overcrowding reduced fitness correlates of the three populations. Ae. albopictus larvae presented lower larval mortality, shorter development time to adult and smaller wing sizes than Ae. aegypti. The presence of Wolbachia had a slight positive effect on larval biology, since infected individuals had higher survivorship than uninfected Ae. aegypti larvae.
In all treatments, Ae. albopictus outperformed both wild Ae. aegypti and the Wolbachia-infected group in larval competition, irrespective of larval density and the amount of food resources. The major force that can slow down Wolbachia invasion is the population density of wild mosquitoes. Given that Ae. aegypti currently dominates in Rio, in comparison with Ae. albopictus frequency, additional attention must be given to the population density of Ae. aegypti during releases to increase the likelihood of Wolbachia invasion.
","Several countries are seeking new vector control tools to reduce the transmission of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. One of these innovative approaches relies on the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the endosymbiont Wolbachia, since this bacterium can block the aforementioned viruses and interrupt transmission. Countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia have a strong co-occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in their urban landscapes. Therefore, Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are likely to lay their eggs in local breeding sites already colonized by wild uninfected conspecifics and/or Ae. albopictus larvae. We conducted experiments to study larval competition with varying larval densities, species proportions and food levels. Interestingly, Ae. albopictus proved to be a superior competitor under different scenarios: its larvae had superior survivorship, faster development rate and a higher performance index than Ae. aegypti (both infected and uninfected groups). The presence of Wolbachia increased larval survivorship of Ae. aegypti. Our data show that the population density of wild mosquitoes, especially interspecific competition, can become an additional force to reduce the pace of Wolbachia invasion in endemic regions.

"In tsetse flies, nutrients for intrauterine larval development are synthesized by the modified accessory gland (milk gland) and provided in mother's milk during lactation. Interference with at least two milk proteins has been shown to extend larval development and reduce fecundity. The goal of this study was to perform a comprehensive characterization of tsetse milk proteins using lactation-specific transcriptome/milk proteome analyses and to define functional role(s) for the milk proteins during lactation. Differential analysis of RNA-seq data from lactating and dry (non-lactating) females revealed enrichment of transcripts coding for protein synthesis machinery, lipid metabolism and secretory proteins during lactation. Among the genes induced during lactation were those encoding the previously identified milk proteins (milk gland proteins 1–3, transferrin and acid sphingomyelinase 1) and seven new genes (mgp4–10). The genes encoding mgp2–10 are organized on a 40 kb syntenic block in the tsetse genome, have similar exon-intron arrangements, and share regions of amino acid sequence similarity. Expression of mgp2–10 is female-specific and high during milk secretion. While knockdown of a single mgp failed to reduce fecundity, simultaneous knockdown of multiple variants reduced milk protein levels and lowered fecundity. The genomic localization, gene structure similarities, and functional redundancy of MGP2–10 suggest that they constitute a novel highly divergent protein family. Our data indicates that MGP2–10 function both as the primary amino acid resource for the developing larva and in the maintenance of milk homeostasis, similar to the function of the mammalian casein family of milk proteins. This study underscores the dynamic nature of the lactation cycle and identifies a novel family of lactation-specific proteins, unique to Glossina sp., that are essential to larval development. The specificity of MGP2–10 to tsetse and their critical role during lactation suggests that these proteins may be an excellent target for tsetse-specific population control approaches.
","Tsetse flies are the sole vector for African trypanosomes, causative agents of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Transcriptome and proteome analyses were utilized to examine the underlying mechanisms of tsetse lactation that occur during each reproductive cycle. These analyses revealed a dramatic shift to the synthesis of milk proteins during lactation and a novel milk-specific protein family. All members of this family were co-localized, shared sequence similarity and were expressed at 40× basal levels during milk secretion. Suppression of gene from this lactation-associated family impaired progeny development by reducing milk protein content and altering milk homeostasis. These novel genes represent an excellent target for tsetse-specific reproductive-based control mechanisms. In addition, the characterization of tsetse milk production revealed multiple factors that are functionally analogous between tsetse and mammalian lactation.

"Micro-algae of the genus Ostreococcus and related species of the order Mamiellales are globally distributed in the photic zone of world's oceans where they contribute to fixation of atmospheric carbon and production of oxygen, besides providing a primary source of nutrition in the food web. Their tiny size, simple cells, ease of culture, compact genomes and susceptibility to the most abundant large DNA viruses in the sea render them attractive as models for integrative marine biology. In culture, spontaneous resistance to viruses occurs frequently. Here, we show that virus-producing resistant cell lines arise in many independent cell lines during lytic infections, but over two years, more and more of these lines stop producing viruses. We observed sweeping over-expression of all genes in more than half of chromosome 19 in resistant lines, and karyotypic analyses showed physical rearrangements of this chromosome. Chromosome 19 has an unusual genetic structure whose equivalent is found in all of the sequenced genomes in this ecologically important group of green algae.
","We propose that chromosome 19 of O. tauri is specialized in defence against viral attack, a constant threat for all planktonic life, and that the most likely cause of resistance is the over-expression of numerous predicted glycosyltransferase genes. O. tauri thus provides an amenable model for molecular analysis of genome evolution under environmental stress and for investigating glycan-mediated host-virus interactions, such as those seen in herpes, influenza, HIV, PBCV and mimivirus.

"The lifespan and activity of proteins depend on protein quality control systems formed by chaperones and proteases that ensure correct protein folding and prevent the formation of toxic aggregates. We previously found that the Arabidopsis thaliana J-protein J20 delivers inactive (misfolded) forms of the plastidial enzyme deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) to the Hsp70 chaperone for either proper folding or degradation. Here we show that the fate of Hsp70-bound DXS depends on pathways involving specific Hsp100 chaperones. Analysis of individual mutants for the four Hsp100 chaperones present in Arabidopsis chloroplasts showed increased levels of DXS proteins (but not transcripts) only in those defective in ClpC1 or ClpB3. However, the accumulated enzyme was active in the clpc1 mutant but inactive in clpb3 plants. Genetic evidence indicated that ClpC chaperones might be required for the unfolding of J20-delivered DXS protein coupled to degradation by the Clp protease. By contrast, biochemical and genetic approaches confirmed that Hsp70 and ClpB3 chaperones interact to collaborate in the refolding and activation of DXS. We conclude that specific J-proteins and Hsp100 chaperones act together with Hsp70 to recognize and deliver DXS to either reactivation (via ClpB3) or removal (via ClpC1) depending on the physiological status of the plastid.
","In this paper we report a relatively simple mechanism by which plant chloroplasts deal with inactive forms of DXS, the main rate-determining enzyme for the production of plastidial isoprenoids relevant for photosynthesis and development. We provide evidence supporting that particular members of the Hsp100 chaperone family contribute to either refold or degrade inactive DXS proteins specifically recognized by the J-protein adaptor J20 and delivered to Hsp70 chaperones. Our results also unveil a J-protein-based mechanism for substrate delivery to the Clp complex, the main protease in the chloroplast stroma. Together, this work allows a better understanding of how chloroplasts get rid of damaged DXS (and potentially other proteins), which should contribute to take more informed decisions in future approaches aimed to manipulate the levels of plastidial metabolites of interest (including vitamins, biofuels, or drugs against cancer and malaria) in crop plants.

"TORC1 is a central regulator of cell growth in response to amino acid availability, yet little is known about how it is regulated. Here, we performed a reverse genetic screen in yeast for genes necessary to inactivate TORC1. The screen consisted of monitoring the expression of a TORC1 sensitive GFP-based transcriptional reporter in all yeast deletion strains using flow cytometry. We find that in response to amino acid starvation, but not to carbon starvation or rapamycin treatment, cells lacking NPR2 and NPR3 fail to fully (1) activate transcription factors Gln3/Gat1, (2) dephosphorylate TORC1 effector Npr1, and (3) repress ribosomal protein gene expression. Both mutants show proliferation defects only in media containing a low quality nitrogen source, such as proline or ammonia, whereas no defects are evident when cells are grown in the presence of glutamine or peptone mixture. Proliferation defects in npr2Δ and npr3Δ cells can be completely rescued by artificially inhibiting TORC1 by rapamycin, demonstrating that overactive TORC1 in both strains prevents their ability to adapt to an environment containing a low quality nitrogen source. A biochemical purification of each demonstrates that Npr2 and Npr3 form a heterodimer, and this interaction is evolutionarily conserved since the human homologs of NPR2 and NPR3 (NPRL2 and NPRL3, respectively) also co-immunoprecipitate. We conclude that, in yeast, the Npr2/3 complex mediates an amino acid starvation signal to TORC1.
","Before a eukaryotic cell commits to cell division it must be large enough so that both daughter cells would be of viable size. The control of cell size is largely mediated by nutritional input signals via an evolutionarily conserved protein complex termed TORC1. In particular, TORC1 has been shown to sense the level of amino acids and its activity correlates with the level of amino acids present in the media. Yet, it is largely unknown how TORC1 senses amino acids. Here we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved Npr2/3 complex mediates the amino acid scarcity signal to TORC1. Cells lacking NPR2 and NPR3 genes fail to inactivate TORC1 when amino acids are scarce. Overactive TORC1 prevents these cells from adapting to an amino acid scarce environment, and, as a result, these cells are unable to proliferate in media that is not rich in amino acids. Artificially inhibiting TORC1 with rapamycin can completely rescue these defects. These results provide insight into how cells sense amino acid deficiency. Moreover, as deletions of NPR2 have been implicated in tumor growth, these results offer a fertile ground to study the role overactive TORC1 might play in those cancers.

"Decisions about noisy stimuli require evidence integration over time. Traditionally, evidence integration and decision making are described as a one-stage process: a decision is made when evidence for the presence of a stimulus crosses a threshold. Here, we show that one-stage models cannot explain psychophysical experiments on feature fusion, where two visual stimuli are presented in rapid succession. Paradoxically, the second stimulus biases decisions more strongly than the first one, contrary to predictions of one-stage models and intuition. We present a two-stage model where sensory information is integrated and buffered before it is fed into a drift diffusion process. The model is tested in a series of psychophysical experiments and explains both accuracy and reaction time distributions.
","In models of decision making, evidence is accumulated until it crosses a threshold. The amount of evidence is directly related to the strength of the sensory input for the decision alternatives. Such one-stage models predict that if two stimulus alternatives are presented in succession, the stimulus alternative presented first dominates the decision, as the accumulated evidence will reach the threshold for this alternative first. Here, we show that for short stimulus durations decision making is not dominated by the first, but by the second stimulus. This result cannot be explained by classical one-stage decision models. We present a two-stage model where sensory input is first integrated before its outcome is fed into a classical decision process.
"
"Decision making is a vital component of human and animal behavior that involves selecting between alternative options and generating actions to implement the choices. Although decisions can be as simple as choosing a goal and then pursuing it, humans and animals usually have to make decisions in dynamic environments where the value and the availability of an option change unpredictably with time and previous actions. A predator chasing multiple prey exemplifies how goals can dynamically change and compete during ongoing actions. Classical psychological theories posit that decision making takes place within frontal areas and is a separate process from perception and action. However, recent findings argue for additional mechanisms and suggest the decisions between actions often emerge through a continuous competition within the same brain regions that plan and guide action execution. According to these findings, the sensorimotor system generates concurrent action-plans for competing goals and uses online information to bias the competition until a single goal is pursued. This information is diverse, relating to both the dynamic value of the goal and the cost of acting, creating a challenging problem in integrating information across these diverse variables in real time. We introduce a computational framework for dynamically integrating value information from disparate sources in decision tasks with competing actions. We evaluated the framework in a series of oculomotor and reaching decision tasks and found that it captures many features of choice/motor behavior, as well as its neural underpinnings that previously have eluded a common explanation.
","In high-pressure situations, such as driving on a highway or flying a plane, people have limited time to select between competing options while acting. Each option is usually accompanied with reward benefits (e.g., avoid traffic) and action costs (e.g., fuel consumption) that characterize the value of the option. The value and the availability of an option can change dynamically even during ongoing actions which compounds the decision-making challenge. How the brain dynamically integrates value information from disparate sources and selects between competing options is still poorly understood. In the current study, we present a neurodynamical framework to show how a distributed brain network can solve the problem of value integration and action selection in decisions with competing alternatives. It combines dynamic neural field theory with stochastic optimal control theory, and includes circuitry for perception, expected reward, effort cost and decision-making. It provides a principled way to explain both the neural and the behavioral findings from a series of visuomotor decision tasks in human and animal studies. For instance, the model shows how the competitive interactions between populations of neurons within and between sensorimotor regions can result in “spatial-averaging” movements, and how decision-variables influence neural activity and choice behavior.

"Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated poxvirus that has been engineered as a vaccine against infectious agents and cancers. Our goal is to understand how MVA modulates innate immunity in dendritic cells (DCs), which can provide insights to vaccine design. In this study, using murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, we assessed type I interferon (IFN) gene induction and protein secretion in response to MVA infection. We report that MVA infection elicits the production of type I IFN in murine conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), but not in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Transcription factors IRF3 (IFN regulatory factor 3) and IRF7, and the positive feedback loop mediated by IFNAR1 (IFN alpha/beta receptor 1), are required for the induction. MVA induction of type I IFN is fully dependent on STING (stimulator of IFN genes) and the newly discovered cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS (cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase). MVA infection of cDCs triggers phosphorylation of TBK1 (Tank-binding kinase 1) and IRF3, which is abolished in the absence of cGAS and STING. Furthermore, intravenous delivery of MVA induces type I IFN in wild-type mice, but not in mice lacking STING or IRF3. Treatment of cDCs with inhibitors of endosomal and lysosomal acidification or the lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin B attenuated MVA-induced type I IFN production, indicating that lysosomal enzymatic processing of virions is important for MVA sensing. Taken together, our results demonstrate a critical role of the cGAS/STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway for type I IFN induction in cDCs by MVA. We present evidence that vaccinia virulence factors E3 and N1 inhibit the activation of IRF3 and the induction of IFNB gene in MVA-infected cDCs.
","Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated vaccinia strain with large deletions of the parental genome that render it non-replicative in mammalian cells. MVA is a safe and effective vaccine against both smallpox and monkeypox. MVA has been investigated as a vaccine vector for infectious diseases and cancers. Dendritic cells (DCs) play important roles in innate and adaptive immunity. A better understanding of how MVA is detected by innate immune sensors in DCs would guide the development of more effective MVA-based vaccines. We report our findings that MVA infection induces the production of type I interferon (IFN) in conventional dendritic cells via a cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway mediated by the newly discovered DNA sensor cGAS, its adaptor STING, and transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. By contrast, wild-type vaccinia virus fails to activate this pathway. Furthermore, we show that vaccinia virulence factors E3 and N1 play inhibitory roles in the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway.

"The expansion of urban ecosystems and climate change, both outcomes of massive lifestyle changes, contribute to a series of side effects such as environmental deterioration, spread of diseases, increased greenhouse gas emissions and introduction of invasive species. In the case of the Athens metropolitan area, an invasive mosquito species—the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus)–has spread widely in the last decade. This spread is favoured within urban environments and is also affected by changing climatic trends. The Asian tiger mosquito is accompanied by risks of mosquito-borne diseases, greater nuisance levels, and increased expenses incurring for its confrontation. The main aims of this paper are (i) to estimate the various costs associated with the control of this invasive species, as well as its health and nuisance impacts, (ii) to evaluate the level of citizens’ well-being from averting these impacts and (iii) to record citizens’ and experts’ perceptions regarding alternative control measures. Evidence shows that experts tend to place a high value on mosquito control when associated with serious health risks, while citizens are more sensitive and concerned about the environmental impacts of control methods. The synthesis of results produced by the current study could act as a preliminary guide for the estimation of societal welfare from the confrontation of similar problems in the context of a complex ecosystem.
","This paper is based on several years’ collaboration among researchers from various disciplines, key health policy makers and stakeholders in an attempt to evaluate the economic dimensions related to the presence of the Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus) and the challenges of tackling mosquito-borne disease outbreaks in Greece and Southern Europe. Similar studies have been conducted and continue to be published in Europe and the USA examining the socioeconomic benefit from the implementation of relevant control and prevention strategies. These studies conclude that there are significant benefits related both to the reduction of nuisance levels and the reduction of the health risks posed by various mosquito species. In our case, the application of an updated economic analysis on the effectiveness of relevant public control and prevention programs provides essential information for public health decision-making, bearing in mind the significant restructuring of the public sector and the fiscal crisis apparent in the European South.

"Several antimalarial drugs exist, but differences between life cycle stages among malaria species pose challenges for developing more effective therapies. To understand the diversity among stages and species, we reconstructed genome-scale metabolic models (GeMMs) of metabolism for five life cycle stages and five species of Plasmodium spanning the blood, transmission, and mosquito stages. The stage-specific models of Plasmodium falciparum uncovered stage-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism and predicted potential targets that could affect several life cycle stages. The species-specific models further highlight differences between experimental animal models and the human-infecting species. Comparisons between human- and rodent-infecting species revealed differences in thiamine (vitamin B1), choline, and pantothenate (vitamin B5) metabolism. Thus, we show that genome-scale analysis of multiple stages and species of Plasmodium can prioritize potential drug targets that could be both anti-malarials and transmission blocking agents, in addition to guiding translation from non-human experimental disease models.
","Malaria kills nearly one-half million people a year and over 1 billion people are at risk of becoming infected by the parasite. Plasmodial infections are difficult to treat for a myriad of reasons, but the ability of the organism to remain latent in hosts and the complex life cycles greatly contributed to the difficulty in treat malaria. Genome-scale metabolic models (GeMMs) enable hierarchical integration of disparate data types into a framework amenable to computational simulations enabling deeper mechanistic insights from high-throughput data measurements. In this study, GeMMs of multiple Plasmodium species are used to study metabolic similarities and differences across the Plasmodium genus. In silico gene-knock out simulations across species and stages uncovered functional metabolic differences between human- and rodent-infecting species as well as across the parasite’s life-cycle stages. These findings may help identify drug regimens that are more effective in targeting human-infecting species across multiple stages of the organism.

"Coalescent theory is routinely used to estimate past population dynamics and demographic parameters from genealogies. While early work in coalescent theory only considered simple demographic models, advances in theory have allowed for increasingly complex demographic scenarios to be considered. The success of this approach has lead to coalescent-based inference methods being applied to populations with rapidly changing population dynamics, including pathogens like RNA viruses. However, fitting epidemiological models to genealogies via coalescent models remains a challenging task, because pathogen populations often exhibit complex, nonlinear dynamics and are structured by multiple factors. Moreover, it often becomes necessary to consider stochastic variation in population dynamics when fitting such complex models to real data. Using recently developed structured coalescent models that accommodate complex population dynamics and population structure, we develop a statistical framework for fitting stochastic epidemiological models to genealogies. By combining particle filtering methods with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we are able to fit a wide class of stochastic, nonlinear epidemiological models with different forms of population structure to genealogies. We demonstrate our framework using two structured epidemiological models: a model with disease progression between multiple stages of infection and a two-population model reflecting spatial structure. We apply the multi-stage model to HIV genealogies and show that the proposed method can be used to estimate the stage-specific transmission rates and prevalence of HIV. Finally, using the two-population model we explore how much information about population structure is contained in genealogies and what sample sizes are necessary to reliably infer parameters like migration rates.
","Mathematical models play an important role in our understanding of what processes drive the complex population dynamics of infectious pathogens. Yet developing statistical methods for fitting models to epidemiological data is difficult. Epidemiological data is often noisy, incomplete, aggregated across different scales and generally provides only a partial picture of the underlying disease dynamics. Using nontraditional sources of data, like molecular sequences of pathogens, can provide additional information about epidemiological dynamics. But current “phylodynamic” inference methods for fitting models to genealogies reconstructed from sequence data have a number of major limitations. We present a statistical framework that builds upon earlier work to address two of these limitations: population structure and stochasticity. By incorporating population structure, our framework can be applied in cases where the host population is divided into different subpopulations, such as by spatial isolation. Our framework also takes into consideration stochastic noise and can therefore capture the inherent variability of epidemiological dynamics. These advances allow for a much wider class of epidemiological models to be fit to genealogies in order to estimate key epidemiological parameters and to reconstruct past disease dynamics.

"In a cross sectional study, 19 French and 23 Colombian cases of confirmed active ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) were evaluated. The objective was to compare clinical, parasitological and immunological responses and relate them to the infecting strains. A complete ocular examination was performed in each patient. The infecting strain was characterized by genotyping when intraocular Toxoplasma DNA was detectable, as well as by peptide-specific serotyping for each patient. To characterize the immune response, we assessed Toxoplasma protein recognition patterns by intraocular antibodies and the intraocular profile of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Significant differences were found for size of active lesions, unilateral macular involvement, unilateral visual impairment, vitreous inflammation, synechiae, and vasculitis, with higher values observed throughout for Colombian patients. Multilocus PCR-DNA sequence genotyping was only successful in three Colombian patients revealing one type I and two atypical strains. The Colombian OT patients possessed heterogeneous atypical serotypes whereas the French were uniformly reactive to type II strain peptides. The protein patterns recognized by intraocular antibodies and the cytokine patterns were strikingly different between the two populations. Intraocular IFN-γ and IL-17 expression was lower, while higher levels of IL-13 and IL-6 were detected in aqueous humor of Colombian patients. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that South American strains may cause more severe OT due to an inhibition of the protective effect of IFN-γ.
","Ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), due to protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is a potential complication of both acquired and congenital infection, leading to visual impairment in numerous countries and being responsible for 30 to 50% of uveitis cases in immunocompetent individuals. In this study we confirmed the presence of more severe ocular toxoplasmosis in a tropical setting of Colombia, when compared to France. The main hypothesis for these clinical differences is based on the idea that severe disease in humans may result from poor host adaptation to neotropical zoonotic strains of T. gondii Indeed, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that South American strains may cause more severe OT due to an inhibition of the intraocular protective immune response.

"Modern computational methods are revealing putative transcription-factor (TF) binding sites at an extraordinary rate. However, the major challenge in studying transcriptional networks is to map these regulatory element predictions to the protein transcription factors that bind them. We have developed a microarray-based profiling of phage-display selection (MaPS) strategy that allows rapid and global survey of an organism's proteome for sequence-specific interactions with such putative DNA regulatory elements. Application to a variety of known yeast TF binding sites successfully identified the cognate TF from the background of a complex whole-proteome library. These factors contain DNA-binding domains from diverse families, including Myb, TEA, MADS box, and C2H2 zinc-finger. Using MaPS, we identified Dot6 as a trans-active partner of the long-predicted orphan yeast element Polymerase A & C (PAC). MaPS technology should enable rapid and proteome-scale study of bi-molecular interactions within transcriptional networks.
","Specific interactions between protein transcription factors (TFs) and their DNA recognition sites are central to the regulation of gene expression. Inter-species conservation of these TF binding sites (TFBS), and their statistical enrichment in sets of co-expressed genes, facilitates their large-scale prediction through computational sequence analysis. A major challenge in characterizing these putative TFBS is the identification of the proteins that bind them. We have developed a new approach to this problem by expressing random genomically encoded protein fragments as fusions to the capsid of bacteriophage T7. We select this diverse phage-display “library” for binding surface-immobilized instances of the TFBS in the form of short double-stranded DNA. This in vitro selection strategy leads to the enrichment of phage whose capsid-fusion peptides interact with the specific DNA sequence. Because each phage carries the DNA encoding the peptide fusion, the identity of the enriched phage can be determined through population-level PCR amplification of DNA inserts and their hybridization to DNA microarrays. Here, we show that this technology efficiently reveals the identity of proteins that bind known and novel predicted regulatory elements. Its application to a predicted yeast element (PAC) reveals Dot6 as one of its interaction partners, both in vitro and within the yeast nucleus.

"Treatment of chronic bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis (TB), requires a
                    remarkably long course of therapy, despite the availability of drugs that are
                    rapidly bacteriocidal in vitro. This observation has long been attributed to the
                    presence of bacterial populations in the host that are
                    “drug-tolerant” because of their slow replication and low rate of
                    metabolism. However, both the physiologic state of these hypothetical
                    drug-tolerant populations and the bacterial pathways that regulate growth and
                    metabolism in vivo remain obscure. Here we demonstrate that diverse
                    growth-limiting stresses trigger a common signal transduction pathway in
                        Mycobacterium tuberculosis that leads to the induction of
                    triglyceride synthesis. This pathway plays a causal role in reducing growth and
                    antibiotic efficacy by redirecting cellular carbon fluxes away from the
                    tricarboxylic acid cycle. Mutants in which this metabolic switch is disrupted
                    are unable to arrest their growth in response to stress and remain sensitive to
                    antibiotics during infection. Thus, this regulatory pathway contributes to
                    antibiotic tolerance in vivo, and its modulation may represent a novel strategy
                    for accelerating TB treatment.
","Despite the availability of antibiotics that rapidly kill bacteria in vitro, the
                    treatment of chronic bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis, requires
                    long-term drug therapy. The reasons for this are unclear, but many have
                    hypothesized that the slow replication and concomitantly low metabolic rate of
                    bacteria in the host environment produce an “antibiotic-tolerant”
                    state. We have tested this hypothesis by identifying the bacterial pathways
                    responsible for slowing the growth and metabolism of Mycobacterium
                        tuberculosis in response to stress. We found that diverse
                    growth-limiting stresses trigger a common signal transduction pathway that slows
                    bacterial growth by redirecting cellular carbon fluxes away from central
                    metabolic pathways and towards storage. Disruption of this metabolic switch
                    increased the antibiotic sensitivity of the bacterium during infection,

"The temporal and spatial change in trends of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in typhoid have not been systematically studied, and such information will be critical for defining intervention, as well as planning sustainable prevention strategies.
To identify the phenotypic trends in AMR, 13,833 individual S. Typhi isolates, reported from 1973 to 2018 in 62 publications, were analysed to determine the AMR preponderance over time. Separate analyses of molecular resistance determinants present in over 4,000 isolates reported in 61 publications were also conducted. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) typhoid is in decline in Asia in a setting of high fluoroquinolone resistance while it is on the increase in Africa. Mutations in QRDRs in gyrA (S83F, D87N) and parC (S80I) are the most common mechanisms responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance. Cephalosporin resistant S. Typhi, dubbed extensively drug-resistant (XDR) is a real threat and underscores the urgency in deploying the Vi-conjugate vaccines.
From these observations, it appears that AMR in S. Typhi will continue to emerge leading to treatment failure, changes in antimicrobial policy and further resistance developing in S. Typhi isolates and other Gram-negative bacteria in endemic regions. The deployment of typhoid conjugate vaccines to control the disease in endemic regions may be the best defence.
","Typhoid is an invasive bacterial disease causing 26 million illness episodes globally, each year particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa afflicting children and poorer sections of society disproportionally. AMR is increasingly recognized among S. Typhi lineages spreading from South Asia to Africa, with resistance to first line antibiotics (co-trimoxazole, ampicillin and chloramphenicol), and fluoroquinolones and, of concern, cephalosporins which contribute to treatment failure. AMR in typhoid is not uniform globally and has evolved at different rates in various endemic regions. These trends have not been systematically analysed previously and the objectives of this study included reviewing the phenotypic and genetic determinants of AMR globally over time. The significance of this study revolves around identifying the different trends and mechanisms of AMR and planning interventional strategies accordingly, particularly in light of the Vi-conjugate vaccine candidate which recently received SAGE recommendation and WHO pre-qualification.

"Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of fatal cardiac arrhythmias requires a tight integration of electrophysiological experiments, models, and theory. Existing models of transmembrane action potential (AP) are complex (resulting in over parameterization) and varied (leading to dissimilar predictions). Thus, simpler models are needed to elucidate the “minimal physiological requirements” to reproduce significant observable phenomena using as few parameters as possible. Moreover, models have been derived from experimental studies from a variety of species under a range of environmental conditions (for example, all existing rabbit AP models incorporate a formulation of the rapid sodium current, INa, based on 30 year old data from chick embryo cell aggregates). Here we develop a simple “parsimonious” rabbit AP model that is mathematically identifiable (i.e., not over parameterized) by combining a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of INa with a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to the voltage dependent, time-independent rectifying outward potassium current (IK). The model was calibrated using the following experimental data sets measured from the same species (rabbit) under physiological conditions: dynamic current-voltage (I-V) relationships during the AP upstroke; rapid recovery of AP excitability during the relative refractory period; and steady-state INa inactivation via voltage clamp. Simulations reproduced several important “emergent” phenomena including cellular alternans at rates > 250 bpm as observed in rabbit myocytes, reentrant spiral waves as observed on the surface of the rabbit heart, and spiral wave breakup. Model variants were studied which elucidated the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave break up, namely the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of IK.The simplicity of the model, and the fact that its parameters have physiological meaning, make it ideal for engendering generalizable mechanistic insight and should provide a solid “building-block” to generate more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology.
","Understanding and preventing life-threatening irregular electrical heart rhythms includes basic experimental, numerical, and theoretical research. Computer models of the electrical dynamics of cardiac cells and impulse propagation throughout the heart are essential tools of this research. For example, simulations of electrical activity such as rotating ‘spiral waves’ have been used to understand how irregular heart rhythms are maintained. However, existing models are derived exclusively from sub-cellular data under a variety of environmental conditions and species. These models tend to be exceedingly complex including hundreds of variables and parameters which make them difficult to validate and analyze. Using experimental data from one species (rabbit) under nearly identical physiological conditions, we developed a simple model of the electrical activity of a cardiac cell derived from sub-cellular, cellular, and tissue experimental data. This model reproduces cellular excitability and its recovery as well as several important “emergent” phenomena including beat-to-beat cellular alterations and unstable spiral waves. Under some conditions, unstable spiral waves in this model give rise to continuous formation of new spiral waves (i.e., “spiral wave breakup”) which is thought to be the underlying cause of cardiac fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.

"Quantifying the effects of climate change on the entomological and epidemiological components of vector-borne diseases is an essential part of climate change research, but evidence for such effects remains scant, and predictions rely largely on extrapolation of statistical correlations. We aimed to develop a mechanistic model to test whether recent increases in temperature in the Mana Pools National Park of the Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe could account for the simultaneous decline of tsetse flies, the vectors of human and animal trypanosomiasis.
The model we developed incorporates the effects of temperature on mortality, larviposition, and emergence rates and is fitted to a 27-year time series of tsetse caught from cattle. These catches declined from an average of c. 50 flies per animal per afternoon in 1990 to c. 0.1 in 2017. Since 1975, mean daily temperatures have risen by c. 0.9°C and temperatures in the hottest month of November by c. 2°C. Although our model provided a good fit to the data, it cannot predict whether or when extinction will occur.
The model suggests that the increase in temperature may explain the observed collapse in tsetse abundance and provides a first step in linking temperature to trypanosomiasis risk. If the effect at Mana Pools extends across the whole of the Zambezi Valley, then transmission of trypanosomes is likely to have been greatly reduced in this warm low-lying region. Conversely, rising temperatures may have made some higher, cooler, parts of Zimbabwe more suitable for tsetse and led to the emergence of new disease foci.
","Tsetse flies are blood-feeding insects that transmit pathogens causing fatal diseases of humans and livestock across sub-Saharan Africa.
The birth and death rates of tsetse are influenced by environmental conditions, particularly temperature.
Since 1975, mean daily temperatures at Rekomitjie, a research station in the Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe, have risen by c. 0.9°C and temperatures in the hottest month of November by c. 2°C. These increases in temperature may have impacted tsetse populations and the diseases they transmit.
Since the 1960s, wild tsetse have been caught regularly from cattle for insecticide tests conducted at Rekomitjie.
Prior to 1990, catches were on average >50 flies per animal per afternoon; however, in 2017, teams frequently failed to catch a single fly.
A mathematical model of tsetse population change, which included temperature-dependent rates for births and deaths, suggests that the decline in tsetse is related to rising temperatures.
Our findings provide a first step in linking the effects of increasing temperatures to the distribution of diseases caused by tsetse.
If the effect extends across the Zambezi Valley, then tsetse-borne disease is likely to have been reduced across the region. Conversely, rising temperatures may have made some higher, cooler areas more suitable, leading to the emergence of new disease foci.

"The knowledge of the tertiary structure of RNA loops is important for understanding their functions. In this work we develop an efficient approach named RNApps, specifically designed for predicting the tertiary structure of RNA loops, including hairpin loops, internal loops, and multi-way junction loops. It includes a probabilistic coarse-grained RNA model, an all-atom statistical energy function, a sequential Monte Carlo growth algorithm, and a simulated annealing procedure. The approach is tested with a dataset including nine RNA loops, a 23S ribosomal RNA, and a large dataset containing 876 RNAs. The performance is evaluated and compared with a homology modeling based predictor and an ab initio predictor. It is found that RNApps has comparable performance with the former one and outdoes the latter in terms of structure predictions. The approach holds great promise for accurate and efficient RNA tertiary structure prediction.
","RNA is an important and versatile macromolecule participating in a variety of biological processes. In addition to experimental approaches, computational prediction of 3D structure of RNAs and loops is an alternative and important source of gaining structure information and insights into their functions. The prediction of RNA loop structures is of particular interest since RNA functions often reside in the loop regions and about 46% of nucleotides in an RNA chain remain unpaired. For this purpose, we develop an approach RNApps based on a probabilistic coarse-grained RNA model. The probabilistic nature of the model, together with a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) growth algorithm, allows a natural and continuous sampling of structures in 3D space, making the approach unique. The coarse-graining nature of the model further increases the efficiency. Here we test this new approach with various types of loops, including hairpin loops, internal loops, and multi-way junction loops, and make comparisons with other structure predictors.

"WRN-1 is the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of the human Werner syndrome protein, a RecQ helicase, mutations of which are associated with premature aging and increased genome instability. Relatively little is known as to how WRN-1 functions in DNA repair and DNA damage signaling. Here, we take advantage of the genetic and cytological approaches in C. elegans to dissect the epistatic relationship of WRN-1 in various DNA damage checkpoint pathways. We found that WRN-1 is required for CHK1 phosphorylation induced by DNA replication inhibition, but not by UV radiation. Furthermore, WRN-1 influences the RPA-1 focus formation, suggesting that WRN-1 functions in the same step or upstream of RPA-1 in the DNA replication checkpoint pathway. In response to ionizing radiation, RPA-1 focus formation and nuclear localization of ATM depend on WRN-1 and MRE-11. We conclude that C. elegans WRN-1 participates in the initial stages of checkpoint activation induced by DNA replication inhibition and ionizing radiation. These functions of WRN-1 in upstream DNA damage signaling are likely to be conserved, but might be cryptic in human systems due to functional redundancy.
","Werner syndrome is a premature aging syndrome associated with genomic instability. The protein linked to Werner syndrome, WRN, has both helicase and exonuclease activities and is thought to be involved in DNA repair, including the resolution of replication fork arrest as well as in telomere maintenance. However, no definite and detailed role of the protein has been elucidated in vivo. We take advantage of the Caenorhabditis elegans germ cell system to explore DNA damage response defects associated with WRN, and we focus particularly on the role of wrn in the cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA replication blockage and ionizing radiation (IR). We show that WRN functions together with RPA upstream of C. elegans ATR in the intra S-phase checkpoint pathway, and upstream of C. elegans ATM and RPA in the cell cycle arrest pathway triggered by IR–induced double-strand DNA breaks. These functions of WRN in upstream DNA damage signaling are likely to be conserved, but not obvious in human systems due to functional redundancy.

"Indoor residual spraying (IRS) with DDT has been the primary strategy for control of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) vector Phlebotomus argentipes in India but efficacy may be compromised by resistance. Synthetic pyrethroids are now being introduced for IRS, but with a shared target site, the para voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), mutations affecting both insecticide classes could provide cross-resistance and represent a threat to sustainable IRS-based disease control.
A region of the Vgsc gene was sequenced in P. argentipes from the VL hotspot of Bihar, India. Two knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations were detected at codon 1014 (L1014F and L1014S), each common in mosquitoes, but previously unknown in phlebotomines. Both kdr mutations appear largely recessive, but as homozygotes (especially 1014F/F) or as 1014F/S heterozygotes exert a strong effect on DDT resistance, and significantly predict survivorship to class II pyrethroids in short-duration bioassays. The mutations are present at high frequency in wild P. argentipes populations from Bihar, with 1014F significantly more common in higher VL areas.
The Vgsc mutations detected appear to be a primary mechanism underlying DDT resistance in P. argentipes and a contributory factor in reduced pyrethroid susceptibility, suggesting a potential impact if P. argentipes are subjected to suboptimal levels of pyrethroid exposure, or additional resistance mechanisms evolve. The assays to detect kdr frequency changes provide a sensitive, high-throughput monitoring tool to detecting spatial and temporal variation in resistance in P. argentipes.
","Visceral leishmaniasis is a fatal disease transmitted solely by the sandfly Phlebotomus argentipes in India. For decades, indoor residual spraying targeting sandflies with DDT has been the main control tool in the region. Emergence of DDT resistance has compromised this strategy and pyrethroids are now being implemented as alternative. Here, we describe the first molecular markers in sandflies for DDT and pyrethroid resistance. Two knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in the para voltage-gated sodium channel target site gene are found at high frequency in natural populations in Bihar, the Indian focus of VL. The kdr variants strongly predict DDT resistance in P. argentipes and survival to lower-level pyrethroid exposure. Careful monitoring of resistance, aided by these markers, and of spraying efficacy is required to monitor changes and forewarn of emergent higher-level pyrethroid resistance in the region.

"DNA double strand break (DSB) is one of the major damages that cause genome instability and cellular aging. The homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of DSBs plays an essential role in assurance of genome stability and cell longevity. Telomeres resemble DSBs and are competent for HR. Here we show that in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomere recombination elicits genome instability and accelerates cellular aging. Inactivation of KEOPS subunit Cgi121 specifically inhibits telomere recombination, and significantly extends cell longevity in both telomerase-positive and pre-senescing telomerase-negative cells. Deletion of CGI121 in the short-lived yku80tel mutant restores lifespan to cgi121Δ level, supporting the function of Cgi121 in telomeric single-stranded DNA generation and thus in promotion of telomere recombination. Strikingly, inhibition of telomere recombination is able to further slow down the aging process in long-lived fob1Δ cells, in which rDNA recombination is restrained. Our study indicates that HR activity at telomeres interferes with telomerase to pose a negative impact on cellular longevity.
","Aging is a general biological process among the living organisms which is affected by environmental stimuli but also genetically controlled. Genome instability is one of the aging hallmarks and has long been implicated as one of the main causal factors in aging. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious DNA damages that cause genome instability. To counteract DNA damage of DSBs and maintain high level of genome integrity, cells have evolved powerful repair systems such as homologous recombination (HR). HR is crucial for DNA repair and genome integrity maintenance, and is generally believed to be essential for assurance of cell longevity. Telomeres, the physical ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes, are preferentially elongated by telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase, in most cases. However, due to the resemblance of telomeres to DSBs, HR can not be eliminated but rather readily takes place on telomeres, even in the presence of telomerase. Here we show that HR at yeast telomeres elicits genome instability and accelerates cellular aging. Inactivation of the evolutionarily conserved KEOPS complex subunit Cgi121 specifically inhibits telomere HR and results in extremely long lifespan, indicating a dark side of HR in longevity regulation.

"Translational repression is often accompanied by mRNA degradation. In contrast, many mRNAs in germ cells and neurons are “stored"" in the cytoplasm in a repressed but stable form. Unlike repression, the stabilization of these mRNAs is surprisingly little understood. A key player in Caenorhabditis elegans germ cell development is the STAR domain protein GLD-1. By genome-wide analysis of mRNA regulation in the germ line, we observed that GLD-1 has a widespread role in repressing translation but, importantly, also in stabilizing a sub-population of its mRNA targets. Additionally, these mRNAs appear to be stabilized by the DDX6-like RNA helicase CGH-1, which is a conserved component of germ granules and processing bodies. Because many GLD-1 and CGH-1 stabilized mRNAs encode factors important for the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET), our findings suggest that the regulation by GLD-1 and CGH-1 serves two purposes. Firstly, GLD-1–dependent repression prevents precocious translation of OET–promoting mRNAs. Secondly, GLD-1– and CGH-1–dependent stabilization ensures that these mRNAs are sufficiently abundant for robust translation when activated during OET. In the absence of this protective mechanism, the accumulation of OET–promoting mRNAs, and consequently the oocyte-to-embryo transition, might be compromised.
","One of the most striking developmental events is the oocyte-to-embryo transition that, in the absence of Pol II–dependent transcription, depends on regulated translation of maternal mRNAs. Prior to their activation, these maternal mRNAs need to be “stored"" in the egg cytoplasm in a repressed but stable form. Surprisingly little is known about how the stored mRNAs are stabilized. The STAR family of RNA–binding proteins includes the C. elegans GLD-1, which controls many aspects of germ cell development. To obtain a comprehensive picture of GLD-1–dependent mRNA regulation, we performed a genome-wide survey of translational repression and mRNA stability of GLD-1 targets. This uncovered a potential role of GLD-1 in mRNA storage, as we found that GLD-1 both represses and stabilizes a subpopulation of its targets. The stabilization also involves a DDX6-like RNA helicase, CGH-1, which is a component of repressive germ granules and processing bodies. Remarkably, the GLD-1 and CGH-1 stabilized mRNAs encode regulators of the oocyte-to-embryo transition, providing an insight into how these functionally related mRNAs are specifically stabilized during germ cell formation. These findings have potential implications for oocyte quality and reproductive fitness, and for mRNA storage in other cell types such as neurons.

"Citrobacter rodentium infection is a mouse model for the important human diarrheal infection caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The pathogenesis of both species is very similar and depends on their unique ability to form intimately epithelium-adherent microcolonies, also known as “attachment/effacement” (A/E) lesions. These microcolonies must be dynamic and able to self-renew by continuous re-infection of the rapidly regenerating epithelium. It is unknown whether sustained epithelial A/E lesion pathogenesis is achieved through re-infection by planktonic bacteria from the luminal compartment or local spread of sessile bacteria without a planktonic phase. Focusing on the earliest events as C. rodentium becomes established, we show here that all colonic epithelial A/E microcolonies are clonal bacterial populations, and thus depend on local clonal growth to persist. In wild-type mice, microcolonies are established exclusively within the first 18 hours of infection. These early events shape the ongoing intestinal geography and severity of infection despite the continuous presence of phenotypically virulent luminal bacteria. Mechanistically, induced resistance to A/E lesion de-novo formation is mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling and is induced specifically by virulent C. rodentium in a virulence gene-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that the establishment phase of C. rodentium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a very short window of opportunity that determines both disease geography and severity.
","The so-called “attaching and effacing” (A/E) pathogens enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) cause serious human diarrheal infections by adhering to and damaging the intestinal epithelium. Previous work on the mouse A/E pathogen Citrobacter rodentium has established that host adaptive immune response and intestinal microbiota cooperate to control the epithelial infection and colonization with this pathogen. We found that this is complemented by a rapid pathogen-induced mucosal innate immune response that is essential to prevent excessive pathogenesis before adaptive immunity takes effect. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by the fact that it normally limits the duration during which the bacteria can induce epithelial lesions to the first 18 hours of infection. Later, luminal virulent bacteria can no longer induce new A/E lesions, but those induced already in the first 18 hours of infection persist through localized epithelial re-infection. Severity of the disease at the peak of infection is consequently shaped by the early events of the first 18 hours. This information may be important for the development of effective therapies and vaccines.

"Botulism, characterized by flaccid paralysis, commonly results from botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) absorption across the epithelial barrier from the digestive tract and then dissemination through the blood circulation to target autonomic and motor nerve terminals. The trafficking pathway of BoNT/A passage through the intestinal barrier is not yet fully understood. We report that intralumenal administration of purified BoNT/A into mouse ileum segment impaired spontaneous muscle contractions and abolished the smooth muscle contractions evoked by electric field stimulation. Entry of BoNT/A into the mouse upper small intestine was monitored with fluorescent HcA (half C-terminal domain of heavy chain) which interacts with cell surface receptor(s). We show that HcA preferentially recognizes a subset of neuroendocrine intestinal crypt cells, which probably represent the entry site of the toxin through the intestinal barrier, then targets specific neurons in the submucosa and later (90–120 min) in the musculosa. HcA mainly binds to certain cholinergic neurons of both submucosal and myenteric plexuses, but also recognizes, although to a lower extent, other neuronal cells including glutamatergic and serotoninergic neurons in the submucosa. Intestinal cholinergic neuron targeting by HcA could account for the inhibition of intestinal peristaltism and secretion observed in botulism, but the consequences of the targeting to non-cholinergic neurons remains to be determined.
","Botulism is a severe and often fatal disease in man and animals characterized by flaccid paralysis. Clostridium botulinum produces a potent neurotoxin (botulinum neurotoxin) responsible for all the symptoms of botulism. Botulism is most often acquired by ingesting preformed botulinum neurotoxin in contaminated food or after intestinal colonization by C. botulinum under certain circumstances, such as in infant botulism, and toxin production in the intestine. The first step of the disease consists in the passage of the botulinum neurotoxin through the intestinal barrier, which is still poorly understood. We investigated the trafficking of the botulinum neurotoxin in a mouse intestinal loop model, using fluorescent HcA (half C-terminal domain of the heavy chain). We observed that HcA preferentially recognizes neuroendocrine intestinal crypt cells, which likely represent the entry site of the toxin through the intestinal barrier, then targets specific neurons, mainly cholinergic neurons, in the submucosa, and later (90–120 min) in the musculosa leading to local paralytic effects such as inhibition of intestinal peristaltism. These results represent an important advance in the understanding of the initial steps of botulism intoxication and can be the basis for the development of new specific countermeasures against botulism.

"Biomolecular function is realized by recognition, and increasing evidence shows that recognition is determined not only by structure but also by flexibility and dynamics. We explored a biomolecular recognition process that involves a major conformational change – protein folding. In particular, we explore the binding-induced folding of IA3, an intrinsically disordered protein that blocks the active site cleft of the yeast aspartic proteinase saccharopepsin (YPrA) by folding its own N-terminal residues into an amphipathic alpha helix. We developed a multi-scaled approach that explores the underlying mechanism by combining structure-based molecular dynamics simulations at the residue level with a stochastic path method at the atomic level. Both the free energy profile and the associated kinetic paths reveal a common scheme whereby IA3 binds to its target enzyme prior to folding itself into a helix. This theoretical result is consistent with recent time-resolved experiments. Furthermore, exploration of the detailed trajectories reveals the important roles of non-native interactions in the initial binding that occurs prior to IA3 folding. In contrast to the common view that non-native interactions contribute only to the roughness of landscapes and impede binding, the non-native interactions here facilitate binding by reducing significantly the entropic search space in the landscape. The information gained from multi-scaled simulations of the folding of this intrinsically disordered protein in the presence of its binding target may prove useful in the design of novel inhibitors of aspartic proteinases.
","The intrinsically disordered peptide IA3 is the endogenous inhibitor for the enzyme named yeast aspartic proteinase saccharopepsin (YPrA). In the presence of YPrA, IA3 folds itself into an amphipathic helix that blocks the active site cleft of the enzyme. We developed a multi-scaled approach to explore the underlying mechanism of this binding-induced ordering transition. Our approach combines a structure-based molecular dynamics model at the residue level with a stochastic path method at the atomic level. Our simulations suggest that IA3 inhibits YPrA through an induced-fit mechanism where the enzyme (YPrA) induces conformational change of its inhibitor (IA3). This expands the definition of an induced-fit model from its original meaning that the binding of substrate (IA3) drives conformational change in the protein (YPrA). Our result is consistent with recent kinetic experiments and provides a microscopic explanation for the underlying mechanism. We also discuss the important roles of non-native interactions and backtracking. These results enrich our understanding of the enzyme-inhibition mechanism and may have value in the design of drugs.

"Effects of polyomavirus SV40 microRNA on pathogenesis of viral infections in vivo are not known. Syrian golden hamsters are the small animal model for studies of SV40. We report here effects of SV40 microRNA and influence of the structure of the regulatory region on dynamics of SV40 DNA levels in vivo. Outbred young adult hamsters were inoculated by the intracardiac route with 1×107 plaque-forming units of four different variants of SV40. Infected animals were sacrificed from 3 to 270 days postinfection and viral DNA loads in different tissues determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. All SV40 strains displayed frequent establishment of persistent infections and slow viral clearance. SV40 had a broad tissue tropism, with infected tissues including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain. Liver and kidney contained higher viral DNA loads than other tissues; kidneys were the preferred site for long-term persistent infection although detectable virus was also retained in livers. Expression of SV40 microRNA was demonstrated in wild-type SV40-infected tissues. MicroRNA-negative mutant viruses consistently produced higher viral DNA loads than wild-type SV40 in both liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regulatory regions displayed modestly higher viral DNA loads in the kidney than those with simple regulatory regions. Early viral transcripts were detected at higher levels than late transcripts in liver and kidney. Infectious virus was detected infrequently. There was limited evidence of increased clearance of microRNA-deficient viruses. Wild-type and microRNA-negative mutants of SV40 showed similar rates of transformation of mouse cells in vitro and tumor induction in weanling hamsters in vivo. This report identified broad tissue tropism for SV40 in vivo in hamsters and provides the first evidence of expression and function of SV40 microRNA in vivo. Viral microRNA dampened viral DNA levels in tissues infected by SV40 strains with simple or complex regulatory regions.
","The recent discovery of virally encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) raises the possibility of additional regulatory processes being involved in viral replication, immune recognition, and host cell survival. In this study, we sought to characterize the effect of SV40-encoded miRNAs and the structure of the viral regulatory region on infections in outbred Syrian golden hamsters. Results revealed that SV40 has a wide tissue tropism, including liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain, with kidney the preferred site for long-term persistent infection. Significant increases in tissue-associated viral DNA loads were observed with miRNA-negative mutant strains, whereas the presence of SV40 miRNAs had no effect on tumor induction and little effect on viral clearance. Our results provide the first evidence for SV40 miRNA expression and function in an in vivo animal model and highlight the complexity of regulation of SV40 viral replication and persistent infections.

"The Kato-Katz technique is the most widely used diagnostic method in epidemiologic surveys and drug efficacy trials pertaining to intestinal schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. However, the sensitivity of the technique is low, particularly for the detection of light-intensity helminth infections. Examination of multiple stool samples reduces the diagnostic error; yet, most studies rely on a single Kato-Katz thick smear, thus underestimating infection prevalence. We present a model which estimates the sensitivity of the Kato-Katz technique in Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm, as a function of infection intensity for repeated stool sampling and provide estimates of the age-dependent ‘true’ prevalence. We find that the sensitivity for S. mansoni diagnosis is dominated by missed light infections, which have a low probability to be diagnosed correctly even through repeated sampling. The overall sensitivity strongly depends on the mean infection intensity. In particular at an intensity of 100 eggs per gram of stool (EPG), we estimate a sensitivity of 50% and 80% for one and two samples, respectively. At an infection intensity of 300 EPG, we estimate a sensitivity of 62% for one sample and 90% for two samples. The sensitivity for hookworm diagnosis is dominated by day-to-day variation with typical values for one, two, three, and four samples equal to 50%, 75%, 85%, and 95%, respectively, while it is only weakly dependent on the mean infection intensity in the population. We recommend taking at least two samples and estimate the ‘true’ prevalence of S. mansoni considering the dependence of the sensitivity on the mean infection intensity and the ‘true’ hookworm prevalence by taking into account the sensitivity given in the current study.
","The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a roadmap for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis morbidity control and interruption of transmission with targets to be reached by 2025. Control efforts require reliable estimates of at-risk populations, number of infections, and disease burden estimates in population subgroups in terms of age and location. Intervention guidelines are based on insensitive diagnostic techniques, such as the Kato-Katz method and do not take into account the effect of sampling effort and infection intensity. Our proposed methodology estimates the infection intensity-dependent sensitivity and the ‘true’ age-prevalence of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm. We also provide recommendations on the number of stool samples required and the methodology to be used to reliably estimate the ‘true’ prevalence of parasitic worm infections.

"Experiments with drug-induced epilepsy in rat brains and epileptic human brain region reveal that focal cooling can suppress epileptic discharges without affecting the brain’s normal neurological function. Findings suggest a viable treatment for intractable epilepsy cases via an implantable cooling device. However, precise mechanisms by which cooling suppresses epileptic discharges are still not clearly understood. Cooling experiments in vitro presented evidence of reduction in neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals and loss of dendritic spines at post-synaptic terminals offering a possible synaptic mechanism. We show that termination of epileptic discharges is possible by introducing a homogeneous temperature factor in a neural mass model which attenuates the post-synaptic impulse responses of the neuronal populations. This result however may be expected since such attenuation leads to reduced post-synaptic potential and when the effect on inhibitory interneurons is less than on excitatory interneurons, frequency of firing of pyramidal cells is consequently reduced. While this is observed in cooling experiments in vitro, experiments in vivo exhibit persistent discharges during cooling but suppressed in magnitude. This leads us to conjecture that reduction in the frequency of discharges may be compensated through intrinsic excitability mechanisms. Such compensatory mechanism is modelled using a reciprocal temperature factor in the firing response function in the neural mass model. We demonstrate that the complete model can reproduce attenuation of both magnitude and frequency of epileptic discharges during cooling. The compensatory mechanism suggests that cooling lowers the average and the variance of the distribution of threshold potential of firing across the population. Bifurcation study with respect to the temperature parameters of the model reveals how heterogeneous response of epileptic discharges to cooling (termination or suppression only) is exhibited. Possibility of differential temperature effects on post-synaptic potential generation of different populations is also explored.
","Focal cooling of the epileptic brain region has been shown to consistently suppress epileptic activity and it is hoped that this treatment can be developed in the future into an implantable cooling device. However, it is still not clearly understood how cooling suppresses epileptic activity. This study uses a computational approach to identify and investigate possible mechanisms. First, we used a neural mass model to reproduce epileptic discharge activity. Next, we simulate the effect of cooling by introducing temperature dependence in the model. Based from evidences reported from in vitro and in vivo studies, we formulated two temperature-dependent mechanisms that can reproduce the effect of cooling on the epileptic discharge activity. Parameter estimation of the model was performed using EEG recordings of focal brain cooling experiments with rats in vivo. Our model involves a synaptic mechanism that results in a reduced frequency of discharges and an intrinsic excitability mechanism that compensates such reduction in frequency of discharges resulting in persistent discharges during cooling but suppressed in magnitude. The temperature dependence is in the form of Q10 temperature coefficients which determine whether suppression or termination of epileptic discharges can be achieved.

"Healthy red blood cells (RBCs) have remarkable deformability, squeezing through narrow capillaries as small as 3 microns in diameter without any damage. However, in many hematological disorders the spectrin network and lipid bilayer of diseased RBCs may be significantly altered, leading to impaired functionality including loss of deformability. We employ a two-component whole-cell multiscale model to quantify the biomechanical characteristics of the healthy and diseased RBCs, including Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs (Pf-RBCs) and defective RBCs in hereditary disorders, such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis. In particular, we develop a two-step multiscale framework based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to predict the static and dynamic responses of RBCs subject to tensile forcing, using experimental information only on the structural defects in the lipid bilayer, cytoskeleton, and their interaction. We first employ CGMD on a small RBC patch to compute the shear modulus, bending stiffness, and network parameters, which are subsequently used as input to a whole-cell DPD model to predict the RBC shape and corresponding stress field. For Pf-RBCs at trophozoite and schizont stages, the presence of cytoadherent knobs elevates the shear response in the lipid bilayer and stiffens the RBC membrane. For RBCs in spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, the bilayer-cytoskeleton interaction is weakened, resulting in substantial increase of the tensile stress in the lipid bilayer. Furthermore, we investigate the transient behavior of stretching deformation and shape relaxation of the normal and defective RBCs. Different from the normal RBCs possessing high elasticity, our simulations reveal that the defective RBCs respond irreversibly, i.e., they lose their ability to recover the normal biconcave shape in successive loading cycles of stretching and relaxation. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the microstructure and biomechanics of RBCs, and demonstrate that the two-step multiscale framework presented here can be used effectively for in silico studies of hematological disorders based on first principles and patient-specific experimental input at the protein level.
","Red blood cells (RBCs) and their mechanical properties play a crucial role in the dynamic and rheological behavior of blood in normal and disease states. However, the precise determination of RBC membrane properties is hard to be achieved experimentally. To this end, accurate numerical modeling can be used to provide valuable information for quantifying the biomechanical properties of RBCs. In this paper, we have developed and validated a two-step multiscale framework for RBC modeling, by performing molecular dynamics simulations to compute the shear modulus, bending stiffness and network parameters of a small RBC patch, which we then use as input to dissipative particle dynamics simulations to predict the stress field and morphology of defective RBCs, including Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs as well as RBCs in hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis.

"A key challenge in movement ecology is to understand how animals move in nature. Previous studies have predicted that animals should perform a special class of random walks, called Lévy walk, to obtain more targets. However, some empirical studies did not support this hypothesis, and the relationship between search strategy and ecological factors is still unclear. We focused on ecological factors, such as predation risk, and analyzed whether Lévy walk may not be favored. It was remarkable that the ecological factors often altered an optimal search strategy from Lévy walk to Brownian walk, depending on the speed of the predator’s movement, density of predators, etc. This occurred because higher target encounter rates simultaneously led searchers to higher predation risks. Our findings indicate that animals may not perform Lévy walks often, and we suggest that it is crucial to consider the ecological context for evaluating the search strategy performed by animals in the field.
","Moving agents should efficiently search for targets (e.g., food, prey, or specific locations) when lacking information about the location of the targets. For this random search problem, the Lévy walk hypothesis claims that Lévy walk movement patterns (i.e., each step length follows a distribution that is heavy-tailed) enable the searcher to capture more targets. However, most searchers may have antagonistic agents (e.g., predators) that can lead to death. Thus, the searcher needs to seek targets while avoiding encounters with antagonistic agents. Here, we show that the Lévy search strategy is less efficient in terms of total lifetime fitness when the predators are abundant, and especially when predators adopt a sit-and-wait strategy. Moreover, the results indicate that the life-cycle type of the searcher is an important fitness factor. These ecological aspects significantly influence the consequences of the random search. Therefore, it is critical to consider the ecological properties of searchers and other interacting agents when examining and estimating animal movements.

"Monocytes are innate immune cells that play a pivotal role in antifungal immunity, but little is known regarding the cellular metabolic events that regulate their function during infection. Using complementary transcriptomic and immunological studies in human primary monocytes, we show that activation of monocytes by Candida albicans yeast and hyphae was accompanied by metabolic rewiring induced through C-type lectin-signaling pathways. We describe that the innate immune responses against Candida yeast are energy-demanding processes that lead to the mobilization of intracellular metabolite pools and require induction of glucose metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and glutaminolysis, while responses to hyphae primarily rely on glycolysis. Experimental models of systemic candidiasis models validated a central role for glucose metabolism in anti-Candida immunity, as the impairment of glycolysis led to increased susceptibility in mice. Collectively, these data highlight the importance of understanding the complex network of metabolic responses triggered during infections, and unveil new potential targets for therapeutic approaches against fungal diseases.
","Fungal infections are a major health concern for immunocompromised individuals due to the lack of success of the currently available antifungal therapies. Unveiling the metabolic processes involved in the immune function offers a promising opportunity for the development of new therapeutic approaches against these infections. In this report, we describe how changes in monocyte glucose metabolism are crucial for host defense against infections caused by the opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. We report how the participation of various metabolic routes, such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and the pentose phosphate pathway, were differentially required after yeast or hyphal exposure, depending on the cellular energy requirements for each response. The proper control of metabolic reprogramming of immune cells was crucial to afford protection against fungal infections in vivo.

"There is an urgent need to substitute the highly toxic compounds still in use for treatment of the encephalitic stage of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). We here assessed the treatment with the doublet cordycepin and the deaminase inhibitor deoxycoformycin for this stage of infection with Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.).
Cordycepin was selected as the most efficient drug from a direct parasite viability screening of a compound library of nucleoside analogues. The minimal number of doses and concentrations of the drugs effective for treatment of T.b. brucei infections in mice were determined. Oral, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administrations of the compounds were successful for treatment. The doublet was effective for treatment of late stage experimental infections with human pathogenic T.b. rhodesiense and T.b. gambiense isolates. Late stage infection treatment diminished the levels of inflammatory cytokines in brains of infected mice. Incubation with cordycepin resulted in programmed cell death followed by secondary necrosis of the parasites. T.b. brucei strains developed resistance to cordycepin after culture with increasing concentrations of the compound. However, cordycepin-resistant parasites showed diminished virulence and were not cross-resistant to other drugs used for treatment of HAT, i.e. pentamidine, suramin and melarsoprol. Although resistant parasites were mutated in the gene coding for P2 nucleoside adenosine transporter, P2 knockout trypanosomes showed no altered resistance to cordycepin, indicating that absence of the P2 transporter is not sufficient to render the trypanosomes resistant to the drug.
Altogether, our data strongly support testing of treatment with a combination of cordycepin and deoxycoformycin as an alternative for treatment of second-stage and/or melarsoprol-resistant HAT.
","There is an urgent need to substitute the highly toxic arsenic compounds still in use for treatment of the encephalitic stage of African trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by infection with Trypanosoma brucei. We exploited the inability of trypanosomes to engage in de novo purine synthesis as a therapeutic target. Cordycepin was selected from a trypanocidal screen of a 2200-compound library. When administered together with the adenosine deaminase inhibitor deoxycoformycin, cordycepin cured mice inoculated with the human pathogenic subspecies T. brucei rhodesiense or T. brucei gambiense even after parasites had penetrated into the brain. Successful treatment was achieved by intraperitoneal, oral or subcutaneous administration of the compounds. Treatment with the doublet also diminished infection-induced cerebral inflammation. Cordycepin induced programmed cell death of the parasites. Although parasites grown in vitro with low doses of cordycepin gradually developed resistance, the resistant parasites lost virulence and showed no cross-resistance to trypanocidal drugs in clinical use. Our data strongly support testing cordycepin and deoxycoformycin as an alternative for treatment of second-stage and/or melarsoprol-resistant HAT.

"Schistosomiasis is an important neglected tropical disease caused by digenean helminth parasites of the genus Schistosoma. Schistosomes are unusual in that they are dioecious and the adult worms live in the blood system. MicroRNAs play crucial roles during gene regulation and are likely to be important in sex differentiation in dioecious species. Here we characterize 112 microRNAs from adult Schistosoma mansoni individuals, including 84 novel microRNA families, and investigate the expression pattern in different sexes. By deep sequencing, we measured the relative expression levels of conserved and newly identified microRNAs between male and female samples. We observed that 13 microRNAs exhibited sex-biased expression, 10 of which are more abundant in females than in males. Sex chromosomes showed a paucity of female-biased genes, as predicted by theoretical evolutionary models. We propose that the recent emergence of separate sexes in Schistosoma had an effect on the chromosomal distribution and evolution of microRNAs, and that microRNAs are likely to participate in the sex differentiation/maintenance process.
","Schistosomiasis is the second most common disease caused by a parasite, affecting over 200 million people. The parasites involved are flatworms of the genus Schistosoma. Unlike most non-parasitic flatworms, Schistosoma species have separate sexes, and the emergence of sex has been associated with the development of a parasitic lifestyle. The identification of gene products that are expressed in a sex-biased fashion permits the study of the origin of sexual dimorphism and, in the case of the schistosomes, the evolution of a human parasite. Here we investigated the differential expression of microRNAs in male and female individuals of the species Schistosoma mansoni. MicroRNAs are crucial gene regulators. We observed that many new microRNAs emerged in the evolutionary lineage leading to the schistosomes. However, many sex-biased microRNAs were present in the hermaphrodite ancestor of the flatworms, and therefore acquired sex-biased expression later on. Our results suggest that changes in microRNA expression patterns were associated with the emergence of separate sexes in the schistosomes.

"The interplay of different virus species in a host cell after infection can affect the adaptation of each virus. Endogenous viral elements, such as endogenous pararetroviruses (PRVs), have arisen from vertical inheritance of viral sequences integrated into host germline genomes. As viral genomic fossils, these sequences can thus serve as valuable paleogenomic data to study the long-term evolutionary dynamics of virus–virus interactions, but they have rarely been applied for this purpose. All extant PRVs have been considered autonomous species in their parasitic life cycle in host cells. Here, we provide evidence for multiple non-autonomous PRV species with structural defects in viral activity that have frequently infected ancient grass hosts and adapted through interplay between viruses. Our paleogenomic analyses using endogenous PRVs in grass genomes revealed that these non-autonomous PRV species have participated in interplay with autonomous PRVs in a possible commensal partnership, or, alternatively, with one another in a possible mutualistic partnership. These partnerships, which have been established by the sharing of noncoding regulatory sequences (NRSs) in intergenic regions between two partner viruses, have been further maintained and altered by the sequence homogenization of NRSs between partners. Strikingly, we found that frequent region-specific recombination, rather than mutation selection, is the main causative mechanism of NRS homogenization. Our results, obtained from ancient DNA records of viruses, suggest that adaptation of PRVs has occurred by concerted evolution of NRSs between different virus species in the same host. Our findings further imply that evaluation of within-host NRS interactions within and between populations of viral pathogens may be important.
","This paper addresses the adaptive strategies of ancient defective viruses recorded in grass genomes. We mined numerous virus segments from various grass genomes and assembled several defective pararetrovirus (non-autonomous PRV) species. We attempted to understand how these non-autonomous PRVs can complete parasitic life cycles in host plants. We determined that these non-autonomous PRV species have participated in interplay with autonomous PRVs or different non-autonomous PRV species. This interplay between different virus genomes has involved the exchange of noncoding regulatory sequences, which consequently evolved to be extraordinarily highly similar in different viruses within the same host. In non-autonomous PRVs, adaptive strategies to compensate for a lack of functionality have consequently involved concerted evolution of noncoding sequences establishing the partnerships.

"Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased summer temperatures in Spain by nearly one degree Celsius on average between 1980 and 2015. However, little is known about the extent to which the association between heat and human mortality has been modified. We here investigate whether the observed warming has been associated with an upward trend in excess mortality attributable to heat or, on the contrary, a decrease in the vulnerability to heat has contributed to a reduction of the mortality burden.
We analysed a dataset from 47 major cities in Spain for the summer months between 1980 and 2015, which included daily temperatures and 554,491 deaths from circulatory and respiratory causes, by sex. We applied standard quasi-Poisson regression models, controlling for seasonality and long-term trends, and estimated the temporal variation in heat-related mortality with time-varying distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs). Results pointed to a reduction in the relative risks of cause-specific and cause-sex mortality across the whole range of summer temperatures. These reductions in turn explained the observed downward trends in heat-attributable deaths, with the only exceptions of respiratory diseases for women and both sexes together. The heat-attributable deaths were consistently higher in women than in men for both circulatory and respiratory causes. The main limitation of our study is that we were not able to account for air pollution in the models because of data unavailability.
Despite the summer warming observed in Spain between 1980 and 2015, the decline in the vulnerability of the population has contributed to a general downward trend in overall heat-attributable mortality. This reduction occurred in parallel with a decline in the vulnerability difference between men and women for circulatory and cardiorespiratory mortality. Despite these advances, the risk of death remained high for respiratory diseases, and particularly in women.
","The Euro-Mediterranean region arises as a major climatic hot spot because of global warming.
Warmer temperatures should in principle contribute to an increase in the number of deaths because of heat.
We do not know yet if and to what extent societal adaptation and/or socioeconomic development is modifying this expected increase.
We analysed daily mortality records from 47 major cities in Spain.
There has been a general and sustained decline in the vulnerability of the population since 1980.
Despite the observed warming, the decline of the vulnerability has generally contributed to a progressive reduction in the number of deaths attributed to heat since 1980.
It is generally believed that climate change will cause an increase in heat-related mortality.
Societal adaptation and/or socioeconomic development contributed, up to now, to a general decline in heat-related mortality.
It is still uncertain if this decline in heat-related mortality will also occur at higher future levels of climate warming.

"Marine sediments are frequently covered by mats of the filamentous Beggiatoa and other large nitrate-storing bacteria that oxidize hydrogen sulfide using either oxygen or nitrate, which they store in intracellular vacuoles. Despite their conspicuous metabolic properties and their biogeochemical importance, little is known about their genetic repertoire because of the lack of pure cultures. Here, we present a unique approach to access the genome of single filaments of Beggiatoa by combining whole genome amplification, pyrosequencing, and optical genome mapping. Sequence assemblies were incomplete and yielded average contig sizes of approximately 1 kb. Pathways for sulfur oxidation, nitrate and oxygen respiration, and CO2 fixation confirm the chemolithoautotrophic physiology of Beggiatoa. In addition, Beggiatoa potentially utilize inorganic sulfur compounds and dimethyl sulfoxide as electron acceptors. We propose a mechanism of vacuolar nitrate accumulation that is linked to proton translocation by vacuolar-type ATPases. Comparative genomics indicates substantial horizontal gene transfer of storage, metabolic, and gliding capabilities between Beggiatoa and cyanobacteria. These capabilities enable Beggiatoa to overcome non-overlapping availabilities of electron donors and acceptors while gliding between oxic and sulfidic zones. The first look into the genome of these filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria substantially deepens the understanding of their evolution and their contribution to sulfur and nitrogen cycling in marine sediments.
","In 1888 Winogradsky proposed the concept of chemolithotrophy—growth using inorganic compounds as an energy source—after studying the sulfur bacterium Beggiatoa. These filamentous bacteria and related organisms inhabit the surface of marine and freshwater sediments, where they oxidize hydrogen sulfide using either oxygen or nitrate. In particular, conspicuously large marine representatives accumulate nitrate in vacuoles to survive anoxia, a unique feature among prokaryotes. Since nitrate-storing Beggiatoa are not available in pure culture, we amplified and sequenced the genomic DNA of single multicellular filaments. We comprehensively tested the incomplete sequence assemblies for foreign DNA. We show that the Beggiatoa genome encodes the pathways of chemolithoautotrophy but also appears to support the use of alternative electron donors and acceptors. We propose that vacuolar-type ATPases generate an electrochemical gradient to drive nitrate transport over the vacuole membrane, a mechanism similar to eukaryotic solute accumulation. Intriguingly, we found evidence for substantial gene exchange between Beggiatoa and cyanobacteria. In both phyla, hemagglutinins are possibly involved in filament formation. The breadth of storage and metabolic capabilities encoded in its genome enables Beggiatoa to act as a “rechargeable battery,” which glides between oxic and sulfidic zones to overcome non-overlapping availabilities of electron donors and acceptors.

"Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~106 M-1s-1). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies multiple ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up multiple pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a single dominant pathway for ligand binding.
","Proteins often bind ligands in buried cavities that appear to be inaccessible based on static structures. The mechanisms and pathways by which ligands reach their binding sites in such cases are, thus, often unknown. Yet, ligand recognition by occluded cavities can happen rapidly. A central question remains: How does such a process occur? Experiments that provide insight at atomic resolution are currently lacking. In the current work, we have used a computational approach to capture the process by which a ligand, benzene, binds to a buried cavity in the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme. Using multiple long, unbiased atomistic simulations, we have discovered how benzene, starting from bulk solvent, finds and binds the solvent-inaccessible cavity. We find that there is no single dominant pathway. Rather, simulated trajectories discover multiple binding pathways with low activation barriers, facilitating a rapid recognition process. We highlight the role of subtle movements in helix positions in opening up multiple crucial paths for benzene to reach its binding cavity without the need for large-scale distortions of the protein structure, explaining the small activation energies.

"Target-based screening is one of the major approaches in drug discovery. Besides the intended target, unexpected drug off-target interactions often occur, and many of them have not been recognized and characterized. The off-target interactions can be responsible for either therapeutic or side effects. Thus, identifying the genome-wide off-targets of lead compounds or existing drugs will be critical for designing effective and safe drugs, and providing new opportunities for drug repurposing. Although many computational methods have been developed to predict drug-target interactions, they are either less accurate than the one that we are proposing here or computationally too intensive, thereby limiting their capability for large-scale off-target identification. In addition, the performances of most machine learning based algorithms have been mainly evaluated to predict off-target interactions in the same gene family for hundreds of chemicals. It is not clear how these algorithms perform in terms of detecting off-targets across gene families on a proteome scale. Here, we are presenting a fast and accurate off-target prediction method, REMAP, which is based on a dual regularized one-class collaborative filtering algorithm, to explore continuous chemical space, protein space, and their interactome on a large scale. When tested in a reliable, extensive, and cross-gene family benchmark, REMAP outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, REMAP is highly scalable. It can screen a dataset of 200 thousands chemicals against 20 thousands proteins within 2 hours. Using the reconstructed genome-wide target profile as the fingerprint of a chemical compound, we predicted that seven FDA-approved drugs can be repurposed as novel anti-cancer therapies. The anti-cancer activity of six of them is supported by experimental evidences. Thus, REMAP is a valuable addition to the existing in silico toolbox for drug target identification, drug repurposing, phenotypic screening, and side effect prediction. The software and benchmark are available at https://github.com/hansaimlim/REMAP.
","High-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, a process which has traditionally adopted a one-drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is astounding and the failure rate is daunting. The failure of the target-based drug discovery is in large part due to the fact that a drug rarely interacts only with its intended receptor, but also generally binds to other receptors. To rationally design potent and safe therapeutics, we need to identify all the possible cellular proteins interacting with a drug in an organism. Existing experimental techniques are not sufficient to address this problem, and will benefit from computational modeling. However, it is a daunting task to reliably screen millions of chemicals against hundreds of thousands of proteins. Here, we introduce a fast and accurate method REMAP for large-scale predictions of drug-target interactions. REMAP outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy, and has been successfully applied to drug repurposing. Thus, REMAP may have broad applications in drug discovery.

"Mathematical models of scientific data can be formally compared using Bayesian model evidence. Previous applications in the biological sciences have mainly focussed on model selection in which one first selects the model with the highest evidence and then makes inferences based on the parameters of that model. This “best model” approach is very useful but can become brittle if there are a large number of models to compare, and if different subjects use different models. To overcome this shortcoming we propose the combination of two further approaches: (i) family level inference and (ii) Bayesian model averaging within families. Family level inference removes uncertainty about aspects of model structure other than the characteristic of interest. For example: What are the inputs to the system? Is processing serial or parallel? Is it linear or nonlinear? Is it mediated by a single, crucial connection? We apply Bayesian model averaging within families to provide inferences about parameters that are independent of further assumptions about model structure. We illustrate the methods using Dynamic Causal Models of brain imaging data.
","Bayesian model comparison provides a formal method for evaluating different computational models in the biological sciences. Emerging application domains include dynamical models of neuronal and biochemical networks based on differential equations. Much previous work in this area has focussed on selecting the single best model. This approach is useful but can become brittle if there are a large number of models to compare and if different subjects use different models. This paper shows that these problems can be overcome with the use of Family Level Inference and Bayesian Model Averaging within model families.

"Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes granulocytic anaplasmosis, an emerging disease of humans and domestic animals. The obligate intracellular bacterium uses its invasins OmpA, Asp14, and AipA to infect myeloid and non-phagocytic cells. Identifying the domains of these proteins that mediate binding and entry, and determining the molecular basis of their interactions with host cell receptors would significantly advance understanding of A. phagocytophilum infection. Here, we identified the OmpA binding domain as residues 59 to 74. Polyclonal antibody generated against a peptide spanning OmpA residues 59 to 74 inhibited A. phagocytophilum infection of host cells and binding to its receptor, sialyl Lewis x (sLex-capped P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1. Molecular docking analyses predicted that OmpA residues G61 and K64 interact with the two sLex sugars that are important for infection, α2,3-sialic acid and α1,3-fucose. Amino acid substitution analyses demonstrated that K64 was necessary, and G61 was contributory, for recombinant OmpA to bind to host cells and competitively inhibit A. phagocytophilum infection. Adherence of OmpA to RF/6A endothelial cells, which express little to no sLex but express the structurally similar glycan, 6-sulfo-sLex, required α2,3-sialic acid and α1,3-fucose and was antagonized by 6-sulfo-sLex antibody. Binding and uptake of OmpA-coated latex beads by myeloid cells was sensitive to sialidase, fucosidase, and sLex antibody. The Asp14 binding domain was also defined, as antibody specific for residues 113 to 124 inhibited infection. Because OmpA, Asp14, and AipA each contribute to the infection process, it was rationalized that the most effective blocking approach would target all three. An antibody cocktail targeting the OmpA, Asp14, and AipA binding domains neutralized A. phagocytophilum binding and infection of host cells. This study dissects OmpA-receptor interactions and demonstrates the effectiveness of binding domain-specific antibodies for blocking A. phagocytophilum infection.
","Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes the potentially deadly bacterial disease granulocytic anaplasmosis. The pathogen replicates inside white blood cells and, like all other obligate intracellular organisms, must enter host cells to survive. Multiple A. phagocytophilum surface proteins called invasins cooperatively orchestrate the entry process. Identifying these proteins’ domains that are required for function, and determining the molecular basis of their interaction with host cell receptors would significantly advance understanding of A. phagocytophilum pathogenesis. In this study, the binding domains of two A. phagocytophilum surface proteins, OmpA and Asp14, were identified. The specific OmpA residues that interact with its host cell receptor were also defined. An antibody cocktail generated against the binding domains of OmpA, Asp14, and a third invasin, AipA, blocked the ability of A. phagocytophilum to infect host cells. The data presented within suggest that binding domains of OmpA, Asp14, and AipA could be exploited to develop a vaccine for granulocytic anaplasmosis.

"Pneumococcal neuraminidase is a key enzyme for sequential deglycosylation of host glycans, and plays an important role in host survival, colonization, and pathogenesis of infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. One of the factors that can affect the activity of neuraminidase is the amount and position of acetylation present in its substrate sialic acid. We hypothesised that pneumococcal esterases potentiate neuraminidase activity by removing acetylation from sialic acid, and that will have a major effect on pneumococcal survival on mucin, colonization, and virulence. These hypotheses were tested using isogenic mutants and recombinant esterases in microbiological, biochemical and in vivo assays. We found that pneumococcal esterase activity is encoded by at least four genes, SPD_0534 (EstA) was found to be responsible for the main esterase activity, and the pneumococcal esterases are specific for short acyl chains. Assay of esterase activity by using natural substrates showed that both the Axe and EstA esterases could use acetylated xylan and Bovine Sub-maxillary Mucin (BSM), a highly acetylated substrate, but only EstA was active against tributyrin (triglyceride). Incubation of BSM with either Axe or EstA led to the acetate release in a time and concentration dependent manner, and pre-treatment of BSM with either enzyme increased sialic acid release on subsequent exposure to neuraminidase A. qRT-PCR results showed that the expression level of estA and axe increased when exposed to BSM and in respiratory tissues. Mutation of estA alone or in combination with nanA (codes for neuraminidase A), or the replacement of its putative serine active site to alanine, reduced the pneumococcal ability to utilise BSM as a sole carbon source, sialic acid release, colonization, and virulence in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia.
","Neuraminidase activity is critical for pneumococcal colonization and virulence as it is required for efficient cleavage of host glycans for nutritional requirements, attachment, and translocation of the microbe through biological membranes. Modifications, such as O-acetylation, in terminal sialic acid can affect the potency of neuraminidase. In this study we investigated whether pneumococcal esterases could potentiate neuraminidase activity by de-acetylating sialic acid. We found that the pneumococcal esterase activity is coded by at least four genes, specific for short acyl chain esters, and the removal of acetylation by esterases potentiates pneumococcal neuraminidase activity for mucin utilisation, colonization and virulence. Hence, this study elucidates the complexity and importance of host de-glycosylation for pneumococcal colonization and virulence, and reveals a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

"It is often assumed that parasites are not virulent to their vectors. Nevertheless, parasites commonly exploit their vectors (nutritionally for example) so these can be considered a form of host. Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan found in mammals and triatomine bugs in the Americas, is the etiological agent of Chagas disease that affects man and domestic animals. While it has long been considered avirulent to its vectors, a few reports have indicated that it can affect triatomine fecundity. We tested whether infection imposed a temperature-dependent cost on triatomine fitness. We held infected insects at four temperatures between 21 and 30°C and measured T. cruzi growth in vitro at the same temperatures in parallel. Trypanosoma cruzi infection caused a considerable delay in the time the insects took to moult (against a background effect of temperature accelerating moult irrespective of infection status). Trypanosoma cruzi also reduced the insects’ survival, but only at the intermediate temperatures of 24 and 27°C (against a background of increased mortality with increasing temperatures). Meanwhile, in vitro growth of T. cruzi increased with temperature. Our results demonstrate virulence of a protozoan agent of human disease to its insect vector under these conditions. It is of particular note that parasite-induced mortality was greatest over the range of temperatures normally preferred by these insects, probably implying adaptation of the parasite to perform well at these temperatures. Therefore we propose that triggering this delay in moulting is adaptive for the parasites, as it will delay the next bloodmeal taken by the bug, thus allowing the parasites time to develop and reach the insect rectum in order to make transmission to a new vertebrate host possible.
","Parasites are often assumed to cause little harm to their arthropod vectors, even though they commonly reproduce inside the arthropods and exploit their nutrients, even causing lesions when crossing internal barriers. Thus, the interests of parasite and vector may well not be aligned and we can expect the parasite to exploit its vector just as it does with its main host, with consequent negative effects on the vector’s fitness. Here, we show that this occurs with Trypanosoma cruzi in its bug vector (T. cruzi causes Chagas disease, affecting ca. 8 million people and disease management is principally attained via vector control). Our results indicate that the parasites delay insect moulting, which is likely beneficial to them as they need time to develop in the insect before the next bloodmeal (that only occurs post-moult). We also show parasite-induced mortality over the narrow range of temperatures which the insect prefers and over which it performs best. In vitro growth of the parasite increases with temperature and we discuss how this may help explain the effects in vivo. Overall, these results will be important to understand the epidemiology of Chagas disease and provide an evolutionary context to explain the parasite′s interaction with its vector.

"Experimental design attempts to maximise the information available for modelling tasks. An optimal experiment allows the inferred models or parameters to be chosen with the highest expected degree of confidence. If the true system is faithfully reproduced by one of the models, the merit of this approach is clear - we simply wish to identify it and the true parameters with the most certainty. However, in the more realistic situation where all models are incorrect or incomplete, the interpretation of model selection outcomes and the role of experimental design needs to be examined more carefully. Using a novel experimental design and model selection framework for stochastic state-space models, we perform high-throughput in-silico analyses on families of gene regulatory cascade models, to show that the selected model can depend on the experiment performed. We observe that experimental design thus makes confidence a criterion for model choice, but that this does not necessarily correlate with a model's predictive power or correctness. Finally, in the special case of linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, we explore how wrong a model has to be before it influences the conclusions of a model selection analysis.
","Different models of the same process represent distinct hypotheses about reality. These can be decided between within the framework of model selection, where the evidence for each is given by their ability to reproduce a set of experimental data. Even if one of the models is correct, the chances of identifying it can be hindered by the quality of the data, both in terms of its signal to measurement error ratio and the intrinsic discriminatory potential of the experiment undertaken. This potential can be predicted in various ways, and maximising it is one aim of experimental design. In this work we present a computationally efficient method of experimental design for model selection. We exploit the efficiency to consider the implications of the realistic case where all models are more or less incorrect, showing that experiments can be chosen that, considered individually, lead to unequivocal support for opposed hypotheses.

"Convergent extension, the simultaneous extension and narrowing of tissues, is a crucial event in the formation of the main body axis during embryonic development. It involves processes on multiple scales: the sub-cellular, cellular and tissue level, which interact via explicit or intrinsic feedback mechanisms. Computational modelling studies play an important role in unravelling the multiscale feedbacks underlying convergent extension. Convergent extension usually operates in tissue which has been patterned or is currently being patterned into distinct domains of gene expression. How such tissue patterns are maintained during the large scale tissue movements of convergent extension has thus far not been investigated. Intriguingly, experimental data indicate that in certain cases these tissue patterns may drive convergent extension rather than requiring safeguarding against convergent extension. Here we use a 2D Cellular Potts Model (CPM) of a tissue prepatterned into segments, to show that convergent extension tends to disrupt this pre-existing segmental pattern. However, when cells preferentially adhere to cells of the same segment type, segment integrity is maintained without any reduction in tissue extension. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this segment-specific adhesion is by itself sufficient to drive convergent extension. Convergent extension is enhanced when we endow our in silico cells with persistence of motion, which in vivo would naturally follow from cytoskeletal dynamics. Finally, we extend our model to confirm the generality of our results. We demonstrate a similar effect of differential adhesion on convergent extension in tissues that can only extend in a single direction (as often occurs due to the inertia of the head region of the embryo), and in tissues prepatterned into a sequence of domains resulting in two opposing adhesive gradients, rather than alternating segments.
","The process of convergent extension is a major contributor to the formation of the anterior-posterior body axis in the early embryo. Convergent extension refers to the directed movement of cells that leads to the extension of tissue in one direction and narrowing of the tissue in the perpendicular direction. Often, convergent extension occurs in tissue which already contains distinct domains of gene expression such as segments, and it is unclear how these patterns are maintained despite extensive cell movement. Interestingly, experimental evidence suggests that these tissue patterns may drive rather than be compromised by convergent extension. However, existing computational models aimed at unravelling the mechanisms of convergent extension have thus far only studied the process in homogeneous tissues. With our model, we demonstrate that in a segmented tissue, preferential adhesion of cells to other cells within the same segment type is required to maintain the tissue pattern during convergent extension. Furthermore, such segment-specific adhesion is by itself capable of driving convergent extension.

"Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modifies synaptic strengths based on timing information available locally at each synapse. Despite this, it induces global structures within a recurrently connected network. We study such structures both through simulations and by analyzing the effects of STDP on pair-wise interactions of neurons. We show how conventional STDP acts as a loop-eliminating mechanism and organizes neurons into in- and out-hubs. Loop-elimination increases when depression dominates and turns into loop-generation when potentiation dominates. STDP with a shifted temporal window such that coincident spikes cause depression enhances recurrent connections and functions as a strict buffering mechanism that maintains a roughly constant average firing rate. STDP with the opposite temporal shift functions as a loop eliminator at low rates and as a potent loop generator at higher rates. In general, studying pairwise interactions of neurons provides important insights about the structures that STDP can produce in large networks.
","The connectivity structure in neural networks reflects, at least in part, the long-term effects of synaptic plasticity mechanisms that underlie learning and memory. In one of the most widespread such mechanisms, spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking across a synapse determines whether it is strengthened or weakened. Therefore, the synapses are modified solely based on local information through STDP. However, STDP can give rise to a variety of global connectivity structures in an interconnected neural network. Here, we provide an analytical framework that can predict the global structures that arise from STDP in such a network. The analytical technique we develop is actually quite simple, and involves the study of two interconnected neurons receiving inputs from their surrounding network. Following analytical calculations for a variety of different STDP models, we test and verify all our predictions through full network simulations. More importantly, the developed analytical tool will allow other researchers to figure out what arises from any other type of STDP in a network.

"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are designed to serve as single summary measures that are easy to construct, condensing information from a large number of genetic variants associated with a disease. They have been used for stratification and prediction of disease risk. The primary focus of this paper is to demonstrate how we can combine PRS and electronic health records data to better understand the shared and unique genetic architecture and etiology of disease subtypes that may be both related and heterogeneous. PRS construction strategies often depend on the purpose of the study, the available data/summary estimates, and the underlying genetic architecture of a disease. We consider several choices for constructing a PRS using data obtained from various publicly-available sources including the UK Biobank and evaluate their abilities to predict not just the primary phenotype but also secondary phenotypes derived from electronic health records (EHR). This study was conducted using data from 30,702 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European descent from the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. We examine the three most common skin cancer subtypes in the USA: basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Using these PRS for various skin cancer subtypes, we conduct a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) within the MGI data to evaluate PRS associations with secondary traits. PheWAS results are then replicated using population-based UK Biobank data and compared across various PRS construction methods. We develop an accompanying visual catalog called PRSweb that provides detailed PheWAS results and allows users to directly compare different PRS construction methods.
","In the study of genetically complex diseases, polygenic risk scores (PRS) synthesize information from multiple genetic risk factors to provide insight into a patient’s inherited risk of developing a disease based on his/her genetic profile. These risk scores can be explored in conjunction with health and disease information available in electronic medical records. PRS may be associated with diseases that may be related to or precursors of the underlying disease of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate how PRS can be used in concert with the medical phenome to better understand the etiology of disease subtypes nested within a broad disease classification. This is done by examining the shared and distinct genetic risk factors across the related but heterogeneous disease subtypes and also through our comparison of the secondary associations across the phenome corresponding to the subtype specific PRS. We consider several PRS construction methods in our study. This framework of analysis is enabled by access to electronic health records and genetics data. Leveraging and harnessing the rich data resources of the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, and the large population-based UK Biobank study, we investigated the primary and secondary disease associations with PRS constructed for the three most common types of skin cancer: melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

"Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease worldwide. Humans usually present a mild non-specific febrile illness, but a proportion of them develop more severe outcomes, such as multi-organ failure, lung hemorrhage and death. Such complications are thought to depend on several factors, including the host immunity. Protective immunity is associated with humoral immune response, but little is known about the immune response mounted during naturally-acquired Leptospira infection.
Here, we used protein microarray chip to profile the antibody responses of patients with severe and mild leptospirosis against the complete Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni predicted ORFeome. We discovered a limited number of immunodominant antigens, with 36 antigens specific to patients, of which 11 were potential serodiagnostic antigens, identified at acute phase, and 33 were potential subunit vaccine targets, detected after recovery. Moreover, we found distinct antibody profiles in patients with different clinical outcomes: in the severe group, overall IgM responses do not change and IgG responses increase over time, while both IgM and IgG responses remain stable in the mild patient group. Analyses of individual patients’ responses showed that >74% of patients in the severe group had significant IgG increases over time compared to 29% of patients in the mild group. Additionally, 90% of IgM responses did not change over time in the mild group, compared to ~51% in the severe group.
In the present study, we detected antibody profiles associated with disease severity and speculate that patients with mild disease were protected from severe outcomes due to pre-existing antibodies, while patients with severe leptospirosis demonstrated an antibody profile typical of first exposure. Our findings represent a significant advance in the understanding of the humoral immune response to Leptospira infection, and we have identified new targets for the development of subunit vaccines and diagnostic tests.
","Leptospirosis is zoonotic disease of global importance, with over a million cases and nearly 60,000 deaths annually. Symptomatic disease presentation ranges from a mild febrile disease with non-specific symptoms to severe forms, characterized by multi-organ failure, lung hemorrhage, and death. Factors driving severe outcomes remain unclear, but the host immune response likely plays an important role. In the present study, we applied high throughput techniques to identify the antibody profiles of patients with severe and mild leptospirosis. We discovered a limited number of immunodominant antigens, specific to patients. Surprisingly, we found the antibody repertoire varies in patients with different clinical outcomes and hypothesized that patients with mild symptoms were protected from severe disease due to pre-existing antibodies, while the profile of patients with severe outcomes was representative of a first exposure. These findings represent a substantial step forward in the knowledge of the humoral immune response to Leptospira infection, and we have identified new targets for vaccine and diagnostic test development.

"Gibberellins (GAs) are a class of important phytohormones regulating a variety of physiological processes during normal plant growth and development. One of the major events during GA-mediated growth is the degradation of DELLA proteins, key negative regulators of GA signaling pathway. The stability of DELLA proteins is thought to be controlled by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Up to date, no phosphatase involved in this process has been identified. We have identified a dwarfed dominant-negative Arabidopsis mutant, named topp4-1. Reduced expression of TOPP4 using an artificial microRNA strategy also resulted in a dwarfed phenotype. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicated that TOPP4 regulates GA signal transduction mainly via promoting DELLA protein degradation. The severely dwarfed topp4-1 phenotypes were partially rescued by the DELLA deficient mutants rga-t2 and gai-t6, suggesting that the DELLA proteins RGA and GAI are required for the biological function of TOPP4. Both RGA and GAI were greatly accumulated in topp4-1 but significantly decreased in 35S-TOPP4 transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants. Further analyses demonstrated that TOPP4 is able to directly bind and dephosphorylate RGA and GAI, confirming that the TOPP4-controlled phosphorylation status of DELLAs is associated with their stability. These studies provide direct evidence for a crucial role of protein dephosphorylation mediated by TOPP4 in the GA signaling pathway.
","Gibberellins (GAs) are essential regulators of plant growth and development. They are tightly related to crop productivity in the first “green revolution.” GA triggers its responses by targeting DELLA proteins, the important repressors, for degradation. This process is believed to be regulated by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, but there are not any reports describing the identification of phosphatases regulating this critical event. By screening an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized Arabidopsis thaliana population, we identified a protein phosphatase TOPP4, a member of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), that acts as a positive regulator in the GA signaling pathway. TOPP4 promotes the GA-induced degradation of DELLA proteins by directly dephosphorylating these proteins. This study provides an important insight for the switch role of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in GA signal transduction and sheds light on PP1 protein phosphatases in regulating plant growth and development.

"Infectious diseases attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene (e.g. Cholera, Leptospirosis, Giardiasis) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in low-income countries. Climate and weather factors are known to affect the transmission and distribution of infectious diseases and statistical and mathematical modelling are continuously developing to investigate the impact of weather and climate on water-associated diseases. There have been little critical analyses of the methodological approaches. Our objective is to review and summarize statistical and modelling methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, in order to identify limitations and knowledge gaps in developing of new methods. We conducted a systematic review of English-language papers published from 2000 to 2015. Search terms included concepts related to water-associated diseases, weather and climate, statistical, epidemiological and modelling methods. We found 102 full text papers that met our criteria and were included in the analysis. The most commonly used methods were grouped in two clusters: process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). In general, PBM methods were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of the pathogen under study was relatively well known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae); TS-SE tended to be used when the specific environmental mechanisms were unclear (e.g. Campylobacter). Important data and methodological challenges emerged, with implications for surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The most common limitations comprised: non-inclusion of key factors (e.g. biological mechanism, demographic heterogeneity, human behavior), reporting bias, poor data quality, and collinearity in exposures. Furthermore, the methods often did not distinguish among the multiple sources of time-lags (e.g. patient physiology, reporting bias, healthcare access) between environmental drivers/exposures and disease detection. Key areas of future research include: disentangling the complex effects of weather/climate on each exposure-health outcome pathway (e.g. person-to-person vs environment-to-person), and linking weather data to individual cases longitudinally.
","Unsafe water supplies, limited sanitation and poor hygiene are still important causes of infectious disease (e.g. Cholera, Leptospirosis, Giardiasis), especially in low-income countries. Climate and weather affect the transmission and distribution of infectious diseases. Therefore, scientists are continuously developing new analysis methods to investigate the impacts of weather and climate on infectious disease, and particularly, on those associated with water. As these methods are based on an imperfect representation of the real world, they are inevitably subjected to many challenges. Based on a systematic review of the literature, we identified seven important challenges for scientists who develop new analysis methods.

"Dengue (DEN) and yellow fever (YF) are re-emerging in East Africa, with contributing drivers to this trend being unplanned urbanization and increasingly adaptable anthropophilic Aedes (Stegomyia) vectors. Entomological risk assessment of these diseases remains scarce for much of East Africa and Kenya even in the dengue fever-prone urban coastal areas. Focusing on major cities of Kenya, we compared DEN and YF risk in Kilifi County (DEN-outbreak-prone), and Kisumu and Nairobi Counties (no documented DEN outbreaks). We surveyed water-holding containers for mosquito immature (larvae/pupae) indoors and outdoors from selected houses during the long rains, short rains and dry seasons (100 houses/season) in each County from October 2014-June 2016. House index (HI), Breteau index (BI) and Container index (CI) estimates based on Aedes (Stegomyia) immature infestations were compared by city and season. Aedes aegypti and Aedes bromeliae were the main Stegomyia species with significantly more positive houses outdoors (212) than indoors (88) (n = 900) (χ2 = 60.52, P < 0.0001). Overall, Ae. aegypti estimates of HI (17.3 vs 11.3) and BI (81.6 vs 87.7) were higher in Kilifi and Kisumu, respectively, than in Nairobi (HI, 0.3; BI,13). However, CI was highest in Kisumu (33.1), followed by Kilifi (15.1) then Nairobi (5.1). Aedes bromeliae indices were highest in Kilifi, followed by Kisumu, then Nairobi with HI (4.3, 0.3, 0); BI (21.3, 7, 0.7) and CI (3.3, 3.3, 0.3), at the respective sites. HI and BI for both species were highest in the long rains, compared to the short rains and dry seasons. We found strong positive correlations between the BI and CI, and BI and HI for Ae. aegypti, with the most productive container types being jerricans, drums, used/discarded containers and tyres. On the basis of established vector index thresholds, our findings suggest low-to-medium risk levels for urban YF and high DEN risk for Kilifi and Kisumu, whereas for Nairobi YF risk was low while DEN risk levels were low-to-medium. The study provides a baseline for future vector studies needed to further characterise the observed differential risk patterns by vector potential evaluation. Identified productive containers should be made the focus of community-based targeted vector control programs.
","Despite the growing problem of dengue (DEN) and yellow fever (YF) evidenced from recent outbreaks in East Africa, risk assessment for their transmission and establishment through surveys of populations of the Aedes mosquito vectors, remain scarce. By estimating standard indices for the potential vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes bromeliae we partly could deduce the risk of transmission of these diseases in three major cities of Kenya, namely Kilifi (DEN-prone) and Kisumu and Nairobi (without any DEN outbreak reports). When compared to established threshold risk levels by WHO and PAHO, our findings suggest low-to-medium risk of urban YF, and high risk of DEN transmission for Kilifi and Kisumu but not Nairobi (low risk level for YF and low-to-medium risk for DEN). The observed seasonal risk patterns, higher Aedes infestation outdoors than indoors and productive container types (jerricans, drums, discarded containers and tyres), provide insights into the disease epidemiology and are valuable for targeted vector control, respectively.

"Genome-wide association studies and follow-up meta-analyses in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have recently identified 163 disease-associated loci that meet genome-wide significance for these two inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These discoveries have already had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the genetic architecture of these diseases and have directed functional studies that have revealed some of the biological functions that are important to IBD (e.g. autophagy). Nonetheless, these loci can only explain a small proportion of disease variance (∼14% in CD and 7.5% in UC), suggesting that not only are additional loci to be found but that the known loci may contain high effect rare risk variants that have gone undetected by GWAS. To test this, we have used a targeted sequencing approach in 200 UC cases and 150 healthy controls (HC), all of French Canadian descent, to study 55 genes in regions associated with UC. We performed follow-up genotyping of 42 rare non-synonymous variants in independent case-control cohorts (totaling 14,435 UC cases and 20,204 HC). Our results confirmed significant association to rare non-synonymous coding variants in both IL23R and CARD9, previously identified from sequencing of CD loci, as well as identified a novel association in RNF186. With the exception of CARD9 (OR = 0.39), the rare non-synonymous variants identified were of moderate effect (OR = 1.49 for RNF186 and OR = 0.79 for IL23R). RNF186 encodes a protein with a RING domain having predicted E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and two transmembrane domains. Importantly, the disease-coding variant is located in the ubiquitin ligase domain. Finally, our results suggest that rare variants in genes identified by genome-wide association in UC are unlikely to contribute significantly to the overall variance for the disease. Rather, these are expected to help focus functional studies of the corresponding disease loci.
","Genetic studies of common diseases have seen tremendous progress in the last half-decade primarily due to recent technologies that enable a systematic examination of genetic markers across the entire genome in large numbers of patients and healthy controls. The studies, while identifying genomic regions that influence a person's risk for developing disease, often do not pinpoint the actual gene or gene variants that account for this risk (called a causal gene/variant). A prime example of this can be seen with the 163 genetic risk factors that have recently been associated with the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. For less than a handful of these 163 is the causative change in the genetic code known. The current study used an approach to directly look at the genetic code for a subset of these and identified a causative change in the genetic code for eight risk factors for ulcerative colitis. This finding is particularly important because it directs biological studies to understand the mechanisms that lead to this chronic life-long inflammatory disease.

"Voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels gate open in response to the membrane voltage. To further our understanding of how cell membrane voltage regulates the opening of a Kv channel, we have studied the protein interfaces that attach the voltage-sensor domains to the pore. In the crystal structure, three physical interfaces exist. Only two of these consist of amino acids that are co-evolved across the interface between voltage sensor and pore according to statistical coupling analysis of 360 Kv channel sequences. A first co-evolved interface is formed by the S4-S5 linkers (one from each of four voltage sensors), which form a cuff surrounding the S6-lined pore opening at the intracellular surface. The crystal structure and published mutational studies support the hypothesis that the S4-S5 linkers convert voltage-sensor motions directly into gate opening and closing. A second co-evolved interface forms a small contact surface between S1 of the voltage sensor and the pore helix near the extracellular surface. We demonstrate through mutagenesis that this interface is necessary for the function and/or structure of two different Kv channels. This second interface is well positioned to act as a second anchor point between the voltage sensor and the pore, thus allowing efficient transmission of conformational changes to the pore's gate.
","Voltage-dependent ion channels open with a voltage dependence that is remarkably steep. This steep voltage dependence, which is essential to the propagation of nerve impulses, originates in the interaction between voltage-sensor domains of the ion channel and its pore. The voltage-sensor domains transmit voltage-driven conformational changes to the pore. To understand how this “electromechanical coupling” mechanism works, we have studied the protein–protein interfaces that connect the voltage sensors to the pore using bioinformatics, electrophysiological recordings, site-directed mutagenesis, and chemical cross-linking. We identify two functionally important interfaces: one links the mobile “voltage-sensor paddle” to the pore's gate near the intracellular membrane surface, while the other links an immobile region of the voltage sensor to the pore near the extracellular membrane surface. The two interfaces encompass only a small fraction of the voltage-sensor surface area, but appear to operate in unison to enable voltage-driven conformational changes within the voltage sensor so as to efficiently regulate the pore's gate.

"The biological actions of steroid hormones are mediated primarily by their cognate nuclear receptors, which serve as steroid-dependent transcription factors. However, steroids can also execute their functions by modulating intracellular signaling cascades rapidly and independently of transcriptional regulation. Despite the potential significance of such “non-genomic” steroid actions, their biological roles and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood, particularly with regard to their effects on behavioral regulation. The major steroid hormone in the fruit fly Drosophila is 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20E), which plays a variety of pivotal roles during development via the nuclear ecdysone receptors. Here we report that DopEcR, a G-protein coupled receptor for ecdysteroids, is involved in activity- and experience-dependent plasticity of the adult central nervous system. Remarkably, a courtship memory defect in rutabaga (Ca2+/calmodulin-responsive adenylate cyclase) mutants was rescued by DopEcR overexpression or acute 20E feeding, whereas a memory defect in dunce (cAMP-specific phosphodiestrase) mutants was counteracted when a loss-of-function DopEcR mutation was introduced. A memory defect caused by suppressing dopamine synthesis was also restored through enhanced DopEcR-mediated ecdysone signaling, and rescue and phenocopy experiments revealed that the mushroom body (MB)—a brain region central to learning and memory in Drosophila—is critical for the DopEcR-dependent processing of courtship memory. Consistent with this finding, acute 20E feeding induced a rapid, DopEcR-dependent increase in cAMP levels in the MB. Our multidisciplinary approach demonstrates that DopEcR mediates the non-canonical actions of 20E and rapidly modulates adult conditioned behavior through cAMP signaling, which is universally important for neural plasticity. This study provides novel insights into non-genomic actions of steroids, and opens a new avenue for genetic investigation into an underappreciated mechanism critical to behavioral control by steroids.
","The brain is a prominent target of steroid hormones, which control a variety of neurobiological processes and are critical to the regulation of behavior. Some effects of these hormones involve changes in gene expression and thus emerge slowly, over the course of hours or even days. Other responses to steroids occur rapidly and are independent of transcriptional regulation. Their functions and mechanisms of action are poorly understood, particularly in the context of steroid-mediated control of behavior. Here we show, using the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), that an unconventional, membrane-bound receptor for the molting hormone ecdysone transmits a novel form of steroid signaling in the adult brain. Our study shows that this novel form of steroid signaling has a robust interface with the classical “memory genes” that encode central components of the so-called cAMP signaling pathway, which is universally important for neuronal and behavioral plasticity. These findings underscore the significance of steroid signaling in memory processing, and provide a foundation for the genetic analysis of rapid, unconventional steroid signaling in behavioral regulation.

"BCCIP is a BRCA2- and CDKN1A(p21)-interacting protein that has been implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity. To understand the in vivo functions of BCCIP, we generated a conditional BCCIP knockdown transgenic mouse model using Cre-LoxP mediated RNA interference. The BCCIP knockdown embryos displayed impaired cellular proliferation and apoptosis at day E7.5. Consistent with these results, the in vitro proliferation of blastocysts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of BCCIP knockdown mice were impaired considerably. The BCCIP deficient mouse embryos die before E11.5 day. Deletion of the p53 gene could not rescue the embryonic lethality due to BCCIP deficiency, but partially rescues the growth delay of mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. To further understand the cause of development and proliferation defects in BCCIP-deficient mice, MEFs were subjected to chromosome stability analysis. The BCCIP-deficient MEFs displayed significant spontaneous chromosome structural alterations associated with replication stress, including a 3.5-fold induction of chromatid breaks. Remarkably, the BCCIP-deficient MEFs had a ∼20-fold increase in sister chromatid union (SCU), yet the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) was modestly at 1.5 fold. SCU is a unique type of chromatid aberration that may give rise to chromatin bridges between daughter nuclei in anaphase. In addition, the BCCIP-deficient MEFs have reduced repair of irradiation-induced DNA damage and reductions of Rad51 protein and nuclear foci. Our data suggest a unique function of BCCIP, not only in repair of DNA damage, but also in resolving stalled replication forks and prevention of replication stress. In addition, BCCIP deficiency causes excessive spontaneous chromatin bridges via the formation of SCU, which can subsequently impair chromosome segregations in mitosis and cell division.
","BCCIP is a BRCA2- and p21-interacting protein. Studies with cell culture systems have suggested an essential role of BCCIP gene in homologous recombination and suppression of replication stress and have suggested that BCCIP defects causes mitotic errors. However, the in vivo function(s) of BCCIP and the mechanistic links between BCCIP's role in suppression of replication stress and mitotic errors are largely unknown. We generated transgenic mouse lines that conditionally express shRNA against the BCCIP, and we found an essential role of BCCIP in embryo development. We demonstrate that BCCIP deficiency causes the formation of a unique type of structural abnormality of chromosomes called sister chromatid union (SCU). It has been noted in the past that impaired homologous recombination and resolution of stalled replication forks can have detrimental consequences in mitosis. However, the physical evidence for this link has not been fully identified. SCU is the product of ligation between sister chromatids, likely formed as a result of unsuccessful attempt(s) to resolve stalled replication forks. Because the SCU will progress into chromatin bridges at anaphase, resulting in mitosis errors, it likely constitutes one of the physical links between S-phase replication stress and mitotic errors.

"Dengue presents a formidable and growing global economic and disease burden, with around half the world's population estimated to be at risk of infection. There is wide variation and substantial uncertainty in current estimates of dengue disease burden and, consequently, on economic burden estimates. Dengue disease varies across time, geography and persons affected. Variations in the transmission of four different viruses and interactions among vector density and host's immune status, age, pre-existing medical conditions, all contribute to the disease's complexity. This systematic review aims to identify and examine estimates of dengue disease burden and costs, discuss major sources of uncertainty, and suggest next steps to improve estimates. Economic analysis of dengue is mainly concerned with costs of illness, particularly in estimating total episodes of symptomatic dengue. However, national dengue disease reporting systems show a great diversity in design and implementation, hindering accurate global estimates of dengue episodes and country comparisons. A combination of immediate, short-, and long-term strategies could substantially improve estimates of disease and, consequently, of economic burden of dengue. Suggestions for immediate implementation include refining analysis of currently available data to adjust reported episodes and expanding data collection in empirical studies, such as documenting the number of ambulatory visits before and after hospitalization and including breakdowns by age. Short-term recommendations include merging multiple data sources, such as cohort and surveillance data to evaluate the accuracy of reporting rates (by health sector, treatment, severity, etc.), and using covariates to extrapolate dengue incidence to locations with no or limited reporting. Long-term efforts aim at strengthening capacity to document dengue transmission using serological methods to systematically analyze and relate to epidemiologic data. As promising tools for diagnosis, vaccination, vector control, and treatment are being developed, these recommended steps should improve objective, systematic measures of dengue burden to strengthen health policy decisions.
","Dengue is the most common mosquito-transmitted viral disease. It represents a formidable public health problem that is expanding in both infection rates and geographical range. Fortunately, vaccines, improved diagnostics, innovative vector control approaches, and other disease control methods are under development. Despite the importance of dengue, there is substantial uncertainty about the magnitude of the disease burden and economic cost of dengue, particularly in the number of symptomatic dengue infections. There is substantial variation in national reporting systems for dengue, which hinders accurate estimates of total cases and, therefore, of economic burden. Here we suggest a combination of immediate, short-term, and longer term strategies to address this knowledge gap. Immediate strategies include, for example, documenting the number of ambulatory visits before and after hospitalization. Short-term recommendations include merging multiple data sources, such as cohort and surveillance data to improve estimates of dengue incidence. Long-term efforts include increasing the collection and analysis of seroprevalence and economic data, use of enhanced surveillance (e.g., use of incentives to improve reporting, include private sector sentinel sites). Implementing these steps would give policy makers more reliable, systematic data for strengthening and refining policies about the application and financing of new technologies to control dengue.

"Lepidopterans (butterflies and moths) are a rich and diverse order of insects, which, despite their economic impact and unusual biological properties, are relatively underrepresented in terms of genomic resources. The genome of the silkworm Bombyx mori has been fully sequenced, but comparative lepidopteran genomics has been hampered by the scarcity of information for other species. This is especially striking for butterflies, even though they have diverse and derived phenotypes (such as color vision and wing color patterns) and are considered prime models for the evolutionary and developmental analysis of ecologically relevant, complex traits. We focus on Bicyclus anynana butterflies, a laboratory system for studying the diversification of novelties and serially repeated traits. With a panel of 12 small families and a biphasic mapping approach, we first assigned 508 expressed genes to segregation groups and then ordered 297 of them within individual linkage groups. We also coarsely mapped seven color pattern loci. This is the richest gene-based map available for any butterfly species and allowed for a broad-coverage analysis of synteny with the lepidopteran reference genome. Based on 462 pairs of mapped orthologous markers in Bi. anynana and Bo. mori, we observed strong conservation of gene assignment to chromosomes, but also evidence for numerous large- and small-scale chromosomal rearrangements. With gene collections growing for a variety of target organisms, the ability to place those genes in their proper genomic context is paramount. Methods to map expressed genes and to compare maps with relevant model systems are crucial to extend genomic-level analysis outside classical model species. Maps with gene-based markers are useful for comparative genomics and to resolve mapped genomic regions to a tractable number of candidate genes, especially if there is synteny with related model species. This is discussed in relation to the identification of the loci contributing to color pattern evolution in butterflies.
","Butterflies and moths (called the Lepidoptera) are a large and diverse group of insects that has long captured the attention of biologists and laymen. The colorful patterns on the wings of butterflies, in particular, offer an ideal system to investigate which genes and developmental mechanisms contribute to evolutionary diversification. Genetic analyses that try to find the position of genes along chromosomes are invaluable for such efforts, also because they allow researchers to compare chromosome content between species. Here, we report on a study which built a gene-based map for the chromosomes of a butterfly “lab rat” and identified chromosomes carrying color pattern genes. We compare our map to that of the reference lepidopteran species, the silkworm. Despite these species having diverged some 100 million years ago, there is much conservation in terms of which genes are found together in chromosomes and even how genes are ordered within chromosomes. However, because we were able to compare positioning of many more genes than had ever been reported before for this group, we also found evidence of several large- and small-scale chromosomal rearrangements. We discuss the advantages of gene-based maps in understanding the genetic basis of color pattern evolution.

"Although the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes has an established predilection for disseminated infection during pregnancy that often results in spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, the specific host-pathogen interaction that dictates these disastrous complications remain incompletely defined. Herein, we demonstrate systemic maternal Listeria infection during pregnancy fractures fetal tolerance and triggers fetal wastage in a dose-dependent fashion. Listeria was recovered from the majority of concepti after high-dose infection illustrating the potential for in utero invasion. Interestingly with reduced inocula, fetal wastage occurred without direct placental or fetal invasion, and instead paralleled reductions in maternal Foxp3+ regulatory T cell suppressive potency with reciprocal expansion and activation of maternal fetal-specific effector T cells. Using mutants lacking virulence determinants required for in utero invasion, we establish Listeria cytoplasmic entry is essential for disrupting fetal tolerance that triggers maternal T cell-mediated fetal resorption. Thus, infection-induced reductions in maternal Foxp3+ regulatory T cell suppression with ensuing disruptions in fetal tolerance play critical roles in pathogenesis of immune-mediated fetal wastage.
","Pregnant women are uniquely susceptible to the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes that preferentially lives inside infected cells. Since infection during pregnancy often triggers prematurity, abortion, or stillbirth, we propose that understanding how these complications occur represent important prerequisites for improving the health of mothers and the developing fetus. Here we investigate the specific interaction between Listeria and a subset of immune-suppressive cells in the mother that expand to create and maintain a hospitable environment for the fetus. We find although Listeria, especially with highdosage infection, can invade the fetus, damage can also occur by infection-induced changes in maternal immune cells that make it markedly less hospitable for the fetus. Under these circumstances, maternal immune-mediated rejection causes fetal injury without direct pathogen invasion. We show this occurs using both reduced-dosages of virulent or weakened Listeria for infection. By comparing pregnancy outcomes and infection-induced changes in the mother that make it more or less hospitable for the fetus, we further demonstrate Listeria gaining entry inside infected cells is the critical factor for immune-mediated fetal injury. These results illustrating infection-induced changes in the mother that lead to fetal injury have important implications for designing new ways to improve the outcomes of pregnancy.

"Phylogenetic networks are necessary to represent the tree of life expanded by edges to represent events such as horizontal gene transfers, hybridizations or gene flow. Not all species follow the paradigm of vertical inheritance of their genetic material. While a great deal of research has flourished into the inference of phylogenetic trees, statistical methods to infer phylogenetic networks are still limited and under development. The main disadvantage of existing methods is a lack of scalability. Here, we present a statistical method to infer phylogenetic networks from multi-locus genetic data in a pseudolikelihood framework. Our model accounts for incomplete lineage sorting through the coalescent model, and for horizontal inheritance of genes through reticulation nodes in the network. Computation of the pseudolikelihood is fast and simple, and it avoids the burdensome calculation of the full likelihood which can be intractable with many species. Moreover, estimation at the quartet-level has the added computational benefit that it is easily parallelizable. Simulation studies comparing our method to a full likelihood approach show that our pseudolikelihood approach is much faster without compromising accuracy. We applied our method to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among swordtails and platyfishes (Xiphophorus: Poeciliidae), which is characterized by widespread hybridizations.
","Phylogenetic networks display the evolutionary history of groups of individuals (species or populations) including reticulation events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer or migration. Here, we present a likelihood method to learn networks from molecular sequences at multiple genes. Our model accounts for several biological processes: mutations, incomplete lineage sorting of alleles in ancestral populations, and reticulations in the network. The likelihood is decomposed into 4-taxon subsets to make the analyses scale to many species and many genes. Our work makes it possible to learn large phylogenetic networks from large data sets, with a statistical approach and a biologically relevant model.

"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) typically causes explosive epidemics of fever, rash and polyarthralgia after its introduction into naïve populations. Since its introduction in Panama in May of 2014, few autochthonous cases have been reported; most of them were found within limited outbreaks in Panama City in 2014 and Puerto Obaldia town, near the Caribbean border with Colombia in 2015. In order to confirm that Panama had few CHIKV cases compared with neighboring countries, we perform an epidemiological analysis of chikungunya cases reported from May 2014 to July 2015. Moreover, to understand this paucity of confirmed CHIKV cases, a vectorial analysis in the counties where these cases were reported was performed.
Chikungunya cases were identified at medical centers and notified to health authorities. Sera samples were analyzed at Gorgas Memorial Institute for viral RNA and CHIKV-specific antibody detection.
A total of 413 suspected cases of CHIKV infections were reported, with incidence rates of 0.5 and 0.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2014 and 2015, respectively. During this period, 38.6% of CHIKV cases were autochthonous with rash and polyarthralgia as predominant symptoms. CHIKV and DENV incidence ratios were 1:306 and 1:34, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of E1/E2 genomic segment indicates that the outbreak strains belong to the Asian genotype and cluster together with CHIKV isolates from other American countries during the same period. Statistical analysis of the National Vector Control program at the district level shows low and medium vector infestation level for most of the counties with CHIKV cases. This index was lower than for neighboring countries.
Previous training of clinical, laboratory and vector workers allowed a good caption and detection of the chikungunya cases and fast intervention. It is possible that low/medium vector infestation level could explain in part the paucity of chikungunya infections in Panama.
","Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito borne pathogen that causes fever with rash and arthralgia, which are often confused with Dengue virus (DENV) infections. It has been reported that when CHIKV colonizes regions without previous circulation, it generally results in explosive human epidemics. In Panama, the first CHIKV infections were detected in May 2014. However, unlike many countries in the Americas, Panama presented with few autochthonous cases during the outbreak. In this study, we investigated the likely reason for the paucity of cases. Low vector infestation level, along with the surveillance programs, preparedness and early outbreak response possibly influenced the low number of cases observed during the Panamanian CHIKV outbreak.

"Genome-wide somatic mutation profiles of tumours can now be assessed efficiently and promise to move precision medicine forward. Statistical analysis of mutation profiles is however challenging due to the low frequency of most mutations, the varying mutation rates across tumours, and the presence of a majority of passenger events that hide the contribution of driver events. Here we propose a method, NetNorM, to represent whole-exome somatic mutation data in a form that enhances cancer-relevant information using a gene network as background knowledge. We evaluate its relevance for two tasks: survival prediction and unsupervised patient stratification. Using data from 8 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show that it improves over the raw binary mutation data and network diffusion for these two tasks. In doing so, we also provide a thorough assessment of somatic mutations prognostic power which has been overlooked by previous studies because of the sparse and binary nature of mutations.
","The transition from a normal cell to a cancer cell is driven by genetic alterations, such as mutations, that induce uncontrolled cell proliferation. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) in the last decade, thousands of tumours have been sequenced and their mutation profiles determined. However, the statistical analysis of these mutation profiles remains challenging. Indeed, two patients usually do not share the same set of mutations and can even have none in common. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish the few disease-causing mutations from the dozens, often hundreds of mutations observed in a tumour. To alleviate these challenges, it has been proposed to use gene-gene interaction networks as prior knowledge, with the idea that if a gene is mutated and non-functional, then its interacting neighbours might not be able to fulfil their function as well. Here we propose NetNorM, a method that transforms mutation data using gene networks so as to make mutation profiles more amenable to statistical learning. We show that NetNorM significantly improves the prognostic power of mutation data compared to previous approaches, and allows defining meaningful groups of patients based on their mutation profiles.

"The regulation of cell migration is essential to animal development and physiology. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans shape the interactions of morphogens and guidance cues with their respective receptors to elicit appropriate cellular responses. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans consist of a protein core with attached heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, which are synthesized by glycosyltransferases of the exostosin (EXT) family. Abnormal HS chain synthesis results in pleiotropic consequences, including abnormal development and tumor formation. In humans, mutations in either of the exostosin genes EXT1 and EXT2 lead to osteosarcomas or multiple exostoses. Complete loss of any of the exostosin glycosyltransferases in mouse, fish, flies and worms leads to drastic morphogenetic defects and embryonic lethality. Here we identify and study previously unavailable viable hypomorphic mutations in the two C. elegans exostosin glycosyltransferases genes, rib-1 and rib-2. These partial loss-of-function mutations lead to a severe reduction of HS levels and result in profound but specific developmental defects, including abnormal cell and axonal migrations. We find that the expression pattern of the HS copolymerase is dynamic during embryonic and larval morphogenesis, and is sustained throughout life in specific cell types, consistent with HSPGs playing both developmental and post-developmental roles. Cell-type specific expression of the HS copolymerase shows that HS elongation is required in both the migrating neuron and neighboring cells to coordinate migration guidance. Our findings provide insights into general principles underlying HSPG function in development.
","During animal development, cells and neurons navigate long distances to reach their final target destinations. Migrating cells are guided by extracellular molecular cues, and cellular responses to these cues are regulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are proteins with long heparan sulfate polysaccharide chains attached. Here we identify and study previously unavailable viable mutants that disrupt the elongation of the heparan sulfate chains in the nematode C. elegans. Our analysis shows that these HS-chain-elongation mutations affect the development of the nervous system as they result in misguided migrations of neurons and axons. Furthermore, we find that heparan sulfate chain elongation occurs in numerous cell types during development and that the coordinated production of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in both the migrating cell and neighboring tissues, ensures proper migration. Our findings highlight the critical roles of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in nervous system development and the evolutionary conservation of the molecular mechanisms driving guided migrations.

"Elite suppressors (ES) are a rare subset of HIV-1–infected individuals who are able to maintain HIV-1 viral loads below the limit of detection by ultra-sensitive clinical assays in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Mechanism(s) responsible for this elite control are poorly understood but likely involve both host and viral factors. This study assesses ES plasma-derived envelope glycoprotein (env) fitness as a function of entry efficiency as a possible contributor to viral suppression. Fitness of virus entry was first evaluated using a novel inducible cell line with controlled surface expression levels of CD4 (receptor) and CCR5 (co-receptor). In the context of physiologic CCR5 and CD4 surface densities, ES envs exhibited significantly decreased entry efficiency relative to chronically infected viremic progressors. ES envs also demonstrated slow entry kinetics indicating the presence of virus with reduced entry fitness. Overall, ES env clones were less efficient at mediating entry than chronic progressor envs. Interestingly, acute infection envs exhibited an intermediate phenotypic pattern not distinctly different from ES or chronic progressor envs. These results imply that lower env fitness may be established early and may directly contribute to viral suppression in ES individuals.
","The majority of HIV-1–infected individuals experience high plasma viral loads and CD4+ T cells loss in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. However, a very rare and important subset of individuals termed elite suppressors is able to maintain HIV-1 plasma viral loads below the limit of viral detection in the absence of treatment. The reasons behind this ability to control the virus are poorly understood, but they likely involve both an effective host immune response against HIV-1 and factors related to the virus itself. Here, we analyze the function of the HIV-1 coat protein or envelope glycoprotein from a group of elite suppressors. HIV-1 envelope mediates entry into the host cell via interaction with the cellular receptors CD4 and CCR5. Envelopes from elite controllers interacted with these receptors inefficiently compared to those from individuals with detectable viral loads. These inefficient interactions by elite suppressor envelopes led to slow rates of entry into host cells. Envelopes from acutely infected individuals were not significantly different from elite suppressors or chronically infected individuals. These findings suggest that the decreased envelope efficiency may contribute to viral control in elite suppressors.

"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic and neurotrophic factor, secreted by endothelial cells, known to impact various physiological and disease processes from cancer to cardiovascular disease and to be pharmacologically modifiable. We sought to identify novel loci associated with circulating VEGF levels through a genome-wide association meta-analysis combining data from European-ancestry individuals and using a dense variant map from 1000 genomes imputation panel. Six discovery cohorts including 13,312 samples were analyzed, followed by in-silico and de-novo replication studies including an additional 2,800 individuals. A total of 10 genome-wide significant variants were identified at 7 loci. Four were novel loci (5q14.3, 10q21.3, 16q24.2 and 18q22.3) and the leading variants at these loci were rs114694170 (MEF2C, P = 6.79x10-13), rs74506613 (JMJD1C, P = 1.17x10-19), rs4782371 (ZFPM1, P = 1.59x10-9) and rs2639990 (ZADH2, P = 1.72x10-8), respectively. We also identified two new independent variants (rs34528081, VEGFA, P = 1.52x10-18; rs7043199, VLDLR-AS1, P = 5.12x10-14) at the 3 previously identified loci and strengthened the evidence for the four previously identified SNPs (rs6921438, LOC100132354, P = 7.39x10-1467; rs1740073, C6orf223, P = 2.34x10-17; rs6993770, ZFPM2, P = 2.44x10-60; rs2375981, KCNV2, P = 1.48x10-100). These variants collectively explained up to 52% of the VEGF phenotypic variance. We explored biological links between genes in the associated loci using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis that emphasized their roles in embryonic development and function. Gene set enrichment analysis identified the ERK5 pathway as enriched in genes containing VEGF associated variants. eQTL analysis showed, in three of the identified regions, variants acting as both cis and trans eQTLs for multiple genes. Most of these genes, as well as some of those in the associated loci, were involved in platelet biogenesis and functionality, suggesting the importance of this process in regulation of VEGF levels. This work also provided new insights into the involvement of genes implicated in various angiogenesis related pathologies in determining circulating VEGF levels. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the identified genes affect circulating VEGF levels could be important in the development of novel VEGF-related therapies for such diseases.
","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a protein with a fundamental role in development of vascular system. The protein, produced by many types of cells, is released in the blood. High levels of VEGF have been observed in different pathological conditions especially in cancer, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, identifying the genetic factors influencing VEGF levels is important for predicting and treating such pathologies. The number of genetic variants associated with VEGF levels has been limited. To identify new loci, we have performed a Genome Wide Association Study meta-analysis on a sample of more than 16,000 individuals from 10 cohorts, using a high-density genetic map. This analysis revealed 10 variants associated with VEGF circulating levels, 6 of these being novel associations. The 10 variants cumulatively explain more than 50% of the variability of VEGF serum levels. Our analyses have identified genes known to be involved in angiogenesis related diseases and genes implicated in platelet metabolism, suggesting the importance of links between this process and VEGF regulation. Overall, these data have improved our understanding of the genetic variation underlying circulating VEGF levels. This in turn could guide our response to the challenge posed by various VEGF-related pathologies.

"Snakebite is a major neglected tropical health issue that affects over 5 million people worldwide resulting in around 1.8 million envenomations and 100,000 deaths each year. Snakebite envenomation also causes innumerable morbidities, specifically loss of limbs as a result of excessive tissue/muscle damage. Snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) are a predominant component of viper venoms, and are involved in the degradation of basement membrane proteins (particularly collagen) surrounding the tissues around the bite site. Although their collagenolytic properties have been established, the molecular mechanisms through which SVMPs induce permanent muscle damage are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the purification and characterisation of an SVMP from a viper (Crotalus atrox) venom. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that this protein is most likely to be a group III metalloprotease (showing high similarity to VAP2A) and has been referred to as CAMP (Crotalus atrox metalloprotease). CAMP displays both collagenolytic and fibrinogenolytic activities and inhibits CRP-XL-induced platelet aggregation. To determine its effects on muscle damage, CAMP was administered into the tibialis anterior muscle of mice and its actions were compared with cardiotoxin I (a three-finger toxin) from an elapid snake (Naja pallida) venom. Extensive immunohistochemistry analyses revealed that CAMP significantly damages skeletal muscles by attacking the collagen scaffold and other important basement membrane proteins, and prevents their regeneration through disrupting the functions of satellite cells. In contrast, cardiotoxin I destroys skeletal muscle by damaging the plasma membrane, but does not impact regeneration due to its inability to affect the extracellular matrix. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the mechanisms through which SVMPs induce permanent muscle damage.
","Snakebite is a major neglected tropical disease that affects thousands of people in the rural areas of developing countries. As well as the deaths, snakebites result in a significant number of disabilities including permanent loss of limbs that alter the lifestyle of the victims. Snake venom is a mixture of different proteins with diverse functions; one of these major protein groups present in viper venoms are metalloproteases that primarily induce muscle damage. The mechanisms behind the development of snakebite (metalloprotease)-induced permanent muscle damage are poorly studied. Here, we have purified a metalloprotease (CAMP) from the venom of the Western diamondback rattlesnake, and characterised its function in mice. To determine the actions of CAMP in the development of permanent muscle damage, it was injected into the muscle of mice in a parallel comparison with cardiotoxin I (from the venom of the Red spitting cobra). The effects of these proteins on muscle regeneration were analysed at 5 and 10 days after injection. The results demonstrate that through a combination of effects on the structural scaffolds surrounding the tissues, blood vessels and regeneration, CAMP significantly affects the muscles, thereby leading to permanent muscle damage.

"The exosome functions throughout eukaryotic RNA metabolism and has a prominent role in gene silencing in yeast. In Arabidopsis, exosome regulates expression of a “hidden” transcriptome layer from centromeric, pericentromeric, and other heterochromatic loci that are also controlled by small (sm)RNA-based de novo DNA methylation (RdDM). However, the relationship between exosome and smRNAs in gene silencing in Arabidopsis remains unexplored. To investigate whether exosome interacts with RdDM, we profiled Arabidopsis smRNAs by deep sequencing in exosome and RdDM mutants and also analyzed RdDM-controlled loci. We found that exosome loss had a very minor effect on global smRNA populations, suggesting that, in contrast to fission yeast, in Arabidopsis the exosome does not control the spurious entry of RNAs into smRNA pathways. Exosome defects resulted in decreased histone H3K9 dimethylation at RdDM-controlled loci, without affecting smRNAs or DNA methylation. Exosome also exhibits a strong genetic interaction with RNA Pol V, but not Pol IV, and physically associates with transcripts produced from the scaffold RNAs generating region. We also show that two Arabidopsis rrp6 homologues act in gene silencing. Our data suggest that Arabidopsis exosome may act in parallel with RdDM in gene silencing, by epigenetic effects on chromatin structure, not through siRNAs or DNA methylation.
","To maintain genomic stability and prevent expansion of invasive genomic sequences such as transposable elements (TEs), eukaryotes have evolved defensive mechanisms to control them. Here, we examine the role of the Arabidopsis exosome complex in such mechanisms. Evolutionarily conserved from archaea to humans, the exosome is a stable complex of RNase-like and RNA binding proteins that plays a central role in RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. Depletion of the exosome allows some repetitive sequences to escape from silencing. Most of these transcripts emanate from centromeric and pericentromeric chromosomal regions and other heterochromatic loci, and many derive from repetitive and transposable elements. In plants, TEs are targeted for de novo DNA methylation by smRNA–mediated pathways. However, we found that exosome depletion has only minor effects on smRNA populations that are acting in the main silencing mechanism in Arabidopsis, siRNAs–dependent DNA methylation RdDM. Instead, exosome depletion affects histone H3K9 dimethylation, an epigenetic mark that affects chromatin structure and thus alters transcription. Our data suggest that the exosome collaborates in gene silencing, likely acting in a parallel pathway to other mechanisms. We also propose that the Arabidopsis exosome may coordinate the transcriptional interplay of different RNA polymerases to modulate repression of some repetitive sequences.

"The neuronal system underlying learning, generation and recognition of song in birds is one of the best-studied systems in the neurosciences. Here, we use these experimental findings to derive a neurobiologically plausible, dynamic, hierarchical model of birdsong generation and transform it into a functional model of birdsong recognition. The generation model consists of neuronal rate models and includes critical anatomical components like the premotor song-control nucleus HVC (proper name), the premotor nucleus RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium), and a model of the syringeal and respiratory organs. We use Bayesian inference of this dynamical system to derive a possible mechanism for how birds can efficiently and robustly recognize the songs of their conspecifics in an online fashion. Our results indicate that the specific way birdsong is generated enables a listening bird to robustly and rapidly perceive embedded information at multiple time scales of a song. The resulting mechanism can be useful for investigating the functional roles of auditory recognition areas and providing predictions for future birdsong experiments.
","How do birds communicate via their songs? Investigating this question may not only lead to a better understanding of communication via birdsong, but many believe that the answer will also give us hints about how humans decode speech from complex sound wave modulations. In birds, the output and neuronal responses of the song generation system can be measured precisely and this has resulted in a considerable body of experimental findings. We used these findings to assemble a complete model of birdsong generation and use it as the basis for constructing a potentially neurobiologically plausible, artificial recognition system based on state-of-the-art Bayesian inference techniques. Our artificial system resembles the real birdsong system when performing recognition tasks and may be used as a functional model to explain and predict experimental findings in song recognition.

"In natural systems, selection acts on both protein sequence and expression level, but it is unclear how selection integrates over these two dimensions. We recently developed the EMPIRIC approach to systematically determine the fitness effects of all possible point mutants for important regions of essential genes in yeast. Here, we systematically investigated the fitness effects of point mutations in a putative substrate binding loop of yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) over a broad range of expression strengths. Negative epistasis between reduced expression strength and amino acid substitutions was common, and the endogenous expression strength frequently obscured mutant defects. By analyzing fitness effects at varied expression strengths, we were able to uncover all mutant effects on function. The majority of mutants caused partial functional defects, consistent with this region of Hsp90 contributing to a mutation sensitive and critical process. These results demonstrate that important functional regions of proteins can tolerate mutational defects without experimentally observable impacts on fitness.
","Changes in protein sequence or expression strength can both lead to adaptation in natural systems. While many studies have focused individually on either expression strength or protein sequence, in principle the fitness effects of these two protein properties are interdependent. We systematically investigated the fitness effects of both expression strength and protein sequence for the yeast Hsp90 gene (Hsp82). We analyzed the fitness effects of all possible point mutations in a putative substrate binding loop under seven different expression strengths. The fitness effects of amino acid substitutions were strongly dependent on expression strength. Many point mutations exhibited fitness defects at reduced expression strength that were hidden at the natural expression strength. Revealing these hidden mutant defects suggested that this region of Hsp90 contributes to a rate-limiting step in function, consistent with its putative role in substrate binding. This study is important because it indicates that critical regions in proteins are more prevalent than would be estimated based on experimental fitness analyses performed at natural expression strengths. As hidden fitness effects are likely to occur in other systems, these findings have broad implications for the field of experimental evolution.

"Histopathological classification of human tumors relies in part on the degree of differentiation of the tumor sample. To date, there is no objective systematic method to categorize tumor subtypes by maturation. In this paper, we introduce a novel computational algorithm to rank tumor subtypes according to the dissimilarity of their gene expression from that of stem cells and fully differentiated tissue, and thereby construct a phylogenetic tree of cancer. We validate our methodology with expression data of leukemia, breast cancer and liposarcoma subtypes and then apply it to a broader group of sarcomas. This ranking of tumor subtypes resulting from the application of our methodology allows the identification of genes correlated with differentiation and may help to identify novel therapeutic targets. Our algorithm represents the first phylogeny-based tool to analyze the differentiation status of human tumors.
","Gene expression profiling of malignancies is often held to demonstrate genes that are “up-regulated” or “down-regulated”, but the appropriate frame of reference against which observations should be compared has not been determined. Fully differentiated somatic cells arise from stem cells, with changes in gene expression that can be experimentally determined. If cancers arise as the result of an abruption of the differentiation process, then poorly differentiated cancers would have a gene expression more similar to stem cells than to normal differentiated tissue, and well differentiated cancers would have a gene expression more similar to fully differentiated cells than to stem cells. In this paper, we describe a novel computational algorithm that allows orientation of cancer gene expression between the poles of the gene expression of stem cells and of fully differentiated tissue. Our methodology allows the construction of a multi-branched phylogeny of human malignancies and can be used to identify genes related to differentiation as well as novel therapeutic targets.

"Melioidosis is caused by the facultative intracellular bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei and is potentially fatal. Despite a growing global burden and high fatality rate, little is known about the disease. Recent studies demonstrate that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition is an effective post-exposure therapeutic for pulmonary melioidosis, which works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This treatment, while effective, was conducted using an experimental COX-2 inhibitor that is not approved for human or animal use. Therefore, an alternative COX-2 inhibitor needs to be identified for further studies. Tolfenamic acid (TA) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) COX-2 inhibitor marketed outside of the United States for the treatment of migraines. While this drug was developed for COX-2 inhibition, it has been found to modulate other aspects of inflammation as well. In this study, we used RAW 264.7 cells infected with B pseudomallei to analyze the effect of TA on cell survival, PGE2 production and regulation of COX-2 and nuclear factor- kappaB (NF-ĸB) protein expression. To evaluate the effectiveness of post-exposure treatment with TA, results were compared to Ceftazidime (CZ) treatments alone and the co-treatment of TA with a sub-therapeutic treatment of CZ determined in a study of BALB/c mice. Results revealed an increase in cell viability in vitro with TA and were able to reduce both COX-2 expression and PGE2 production while also decreasing NF-ĸB activation during infection. Co-treatment of orally administered TA and a sub-therapeutic treatment of CZ significantly increased survival outcome and cleared the bacterial load within organ tissue. Additionally, we demonstrated that post-exposure TA treatment with sub-therapeutic CZ is effective to treat melioidosis in BALB/c mice.
","Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a fatal tropical disease endemic in parts of Southwest Asia and Northern Australia. While it was once believed to be isolated to these areas, recent research indicates the global burden on melioidosis is growing. Furthermore, treatment of melioidosis is difficult because of the high occurrence of disease relapse and increasing antibacterial resistance. Recent research suggests that immunomodulation via COX-2 inhibition to subsequently reduce with PGE2 production is an effective therapeutic strategy for melioidosis. The current study was built on this immunomodulatory principle by using an orally administered COX-2 inhibitor and evaluating its effects on the COX-2 and NF-ĸB pathways. We also investigated whether the conjunctive therapies of immunomodulation and antibiotics increased efficacy of the treatment. We confirmed immunomodulation is effective as a post-exposure therapeutic in BALB/c mice. More importantly, we found that conjunctive post-exposure treatment via immunomodulation increased antibacterial treatment efficacy. Conjunctive therapy may prove efficacious for other infectious diseases resembling melioidosis. Hence, further research is needed to identify the long-term effects of the described treatment(s) across multiple animal models.

"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to identify the common genetic component to ischaemic stroke (IS). However, IS has considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. Where clinical covariates explain a large fraction of disease risk, covariate informed designs can increase power to detect associations. As prevalence rates in IS are markedly affected by age, and younger onset cases may have higher genetic predisposition, we investigated whether an age-at-onset informed approach could detect novel associations with IS and its subtypes; cardioembolic (CE), large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) and small vessel disease (SVD) in 6,778 cases of European ancestry and 12,095 ancestry-matched controls. Regression analysis to identify SNP associations was performed on posterior liabilities after conditioning on age-at-onset and affection status. We sought further evidence of an association with LAA in 1,881 cases and 50,817 controls, and examined mRNA expression levels of the nearby genes in atherosclerotic carotid artery plaques. Secondly, we performed permutation analyses to evaluate the extent to which age-at-onset informed analysis improves significance for novel loci. We identified a novel association with an MMP12 locus in LAA (rs660599; p = 2.5×10−7), with independent replication in a second population (p = 0.0048, OR(95% CI) = 1.18(1.05–1.32); meta-analysis p = 2.6×10−8). The nearby gene, MMP12, was significantly overexpressed in carotid plaques compared to atherosclerosis-free control arteries (p = 1.2×10−15; fold change = 335.6). Permutation analyses demonstrated improved significance for associations when accounting for age-at-onset in all four stroke phenotypes (p<0.001). Our results show that a covariate-informed design, by adjusting for age-at-onset of stroke, can detect variants not identified by conventional GWAS.
","Ischaemic stroke places an enormous burden on global healthcare. However, the disease processes that lead to stroke are not fully understood. Genome-wide association studies have recently established that common genetic variants can increase risk of ischaemic stroke and its subtypes. In this study, we aimed to identify novel genetic associations with ischaemic stroke and its subtypes by addressing the fact that younger onset cases may have a stronger genetic component, and using this information in our analyses. We identify a novel genetic variant on chromosome 11 (rs660599), which is associated with increased risk of large artery stroke. We also show that mRNA expression of the nearest gene (MMP12) is higher in arteries with the disease process underlying large artery stroke (atherosclerosis). Finally, we evaluate our novel analysis approach, and show that our method is likely to identify further associations with ischaemic stroke.

"One goal of modern day neuroscience is the establishment of molecular maps that assign unique features to individual neuron types. Such maps provide important starting points for neuron classification, for functional analysis, and for developmental studies aimed at defining the molecular mechanisms of neuron identity acquisition and neuron identity diversification. In this resource paper, we describe a nervous system-wide map of the potential expression sites of 244 members of the largest gene family in the C. elegans genome, rhodopsin-like (class A) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) chemoreceptors, using classic gfp reporter gene technology. We cover representatives of all sequence families of chemoreceptor GPCRs, some of which were previously entirely uncharacterized. Most reporters are expressed in a very restricted number of cells, often just in single cells. We assign GPCR reporter expression to all but two of the 37 sensory neuron classes of the sex-shared, core nervous system. Some sensory neurons express a very small number of receptors, while others, particularly nociceptive neurons, coexpress several dozen GPCR reporter genes. GPCR reporters are also expressed in a wide range of inter- and motorneurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that GPCRs may constitute receptors not just for environmental signals, but also for internal cues. We observe only one notable, frequent association of coexpression patterns, namely in one nociceptive amphid (ASH) and two nociceptive phasmid sensory neurons (PHA, PHB). We identified GPCRs with sexually dimorphic expression and several GPCR reporters that are expressed in a left/right asymmetric manner. We identified a substantial degree of GPCR expression plasticity; particularly in the context of the environmentally-induced dauer diapause stage when one third of all tested GPCRs alter the cellular specificity of their expression within and outside the nervous system. Intriguingly, in a number of cases, the dauer-specific alterations of GPCR reporter expression in specific neuron classes are maintained during postdauer life and in some case new patterns are induced post-dauer, demonstrating that GPCR gene expression may serve as traits of life history. Taken together, our resource provides an entry point for functional studies and also offers a host of molecular markers for studying molecular patterning and plasticity of the nervous system.
","Maps of gene expression patterns in nervous systems provide an important resource for neuron classification, for functional analysis, and for developmental studies that ask how different neurons acquire their unique identities. By analyzing transgenic GFP reporter strains, we describe here the expression pattern of 244 putative chemosensory receptor-encoding genes, which constitute the largest gene family in Caenorhabditis elegans. As expected, chemoreceptor expression is enriched in chemosensory neurons. Putative chemoreceptors are also expressed in a wide range of interneurons and motor neurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that these receptors may sense internal cues in addition to environmental signals. Each chemoreceptor is expressed sparsely, often in just one neuron type, but each neuron type can express many chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptor expression is remarkably plastic, particularly in the context of the environmentally induced dauer diapause stage. Taken together, this molecular atlas of chemosensory receptors provides an entry point for functional studies and offers a host of markers for studying neuronal patterning and plasticity.

"The Neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (mtTyrRS; CYT-18 protein) evolved a new function as a group I intron splicing factor by acquiring the ability to bind group I intron RNAs and stabilize their catalytically active RNA structure. Previous studies showed: (i) CYT-18 binds group I introns by using both its N-terminal catalytic domain and flexibly attached C-terminal anticodon-binding domain (CTD); and (ii) the catalytic domain binds group I introns specifically via multiple structural adaptations that occurred during or after the divergence of Peziomycotina and Saccharomycotina. However, the function of the CTD and how it contributed to the evolution of splicing activity have been unclear. Here, small angle X-ray scattering analysis of CYT-18 shows that both CTDs of the homodimeric protein extend outward from the catalytic domain, but move inward to bind opposite ends of a group I intron RNA. Biochemical assays show that the isolated CTD of CYT-18 binds RNAs non-specifically, possibly contributing to its interaction with the structurally different ends of the intron RNA. Finally, we find that the yeast mtTyrRS, which diverged from Pezizomycotina fungal mtTyrRSs prior to the evolution of splicing activity, binds group I intron and other RNAs non-specifically via its CTD, but lacks further adaptations needed for group I intron splicing. Our results suggest a scenario of constructive neutral (i.e., pre-adaptive) evolution in which an initial non-specific interaction between the CTD of an ancestral fungal mtTyrRS and a self-splicing group I intron was “fixed” by an intron RNA mutation that resulted in protein-dependent splicing. Once fixed, this interaction could be elaborated by further adaptive mutations in both the catalytic domain and CTD that enabled specific binding of group I introns. Our results highlight a role for non-specific RNA binding in the evolution of RNA-binding proteins.
","The acquisition of new modes of post-transcriptional gene regulation played an important role in the evolution of eukaryotes and was achieved by an increase in the number of RNA-binding proteins with new functions. RNA-binding proteins bind directly to double- or single-stranded RNA and regulate many cellular processes. Here, we address how proteins evolve new RNA-binding functions by using as a model system a fungal mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that evolved to acquire a novel function in splicing group I introns. Group I introns are RNA enzymes (or “ribozymes”) that catalyze their own removal from transcripts, but can become dependent upon proteins to stabilize their active structure. We show that the C-terminal domain of the synthetase is flexibly attached and has high non-specific RNA-binding activity that likely pre-dated the evolution of splicing activity. Our findings suggest an evolutionary scenario in which an initial non-specific interaction between an ancestral synthetase and a self-splicing group I intron was fixed by an intron RNA mutation, thereby making it dependent upon the protein for structural stabilization. The interaction then evolved by the acquisition of adaptive mutations throughout the protein and RNA that increased both the splicing efficiency and its protein-dependence. Our results suggest a general mechanism by which non-specific binding interactions can lead to the evolution of new RNA-binding functions and provide novel insights into splicing and synthetase mechanisms.

"Resistance against different antibiotics appears on the same bacterial strains more often than expected by chance, leading to high frequencies of multidrug resistance. There are multiple explanations for this observation, but these tend to be specific to subsets of antibiotics and/or bacterial species, whereas the trend is pervasive. Here, we consider the question in terms of strain ecology: explaining why resistance to different antibiotics is often seen on the same strain requires an understanding of the competition between strains with different resistance profiles. This work builds on models originally proposed to explain another aspect of strain competition: the stable coexistence of antibiotic sensitivity and resistance observed in a number of bacterial species. We first identify a partial structural similarity in these models: either strain or host population structure stratifies the pathogen population into evolutionarily independent sub-populations and introduces variation in the fitness effect of resistance between these sub-populations, thus creating niches for sensitivity and resistance. We then generalise this unified underlying model to multidrug resistance and show that models with this structure predict high levels of association between resistance to different drugs and high multidrug resistance frequencies. We test predictions from this model in six bacterial datasets and find them to be qualitatively consistent with observed trends. The higher than expected frequencies of multidrug resistance are often interpreted as evidence that these strains are out-competing strains with lower resistance multiplicity. Our work provides an alternative explanation that is compatible with long-term stability in resistance frequencies.
","Antibiotic resistance is a serious public health concern, yet the ecology and evolution of drug resistance are not fully understood. This impacts our ability to design effective interventions to combat resistance. From a public health point of view, multidrug resistance is particularly problematic because resistance to different antibiotics is often seen on the same bacterial strains, which leads to high frequencies of multidrug resistance and limits treatment options. This work seeks to explain this trend in terms of strain ecology and the competition between strains with different resistance profiles. Building on recent work exploring why resistant bacteria are not out-competing sensitive bacteria, we show that models originally proposed to explain this observation also predict high multidrug resistance frequencies. These models are therefore a unifying explanation for two pervasive trends in resistance dynamics. In terms of public health, the implication of our results is that new resistances are likeliest to be found on already multidrug resistant strains and that changing patterns of prescription may not be enough to combat multidrug resistance.

"Among mammals, genetic recombination occurs at highly delimited sites known as recombination hotspots. They are typically 1–2 kb long and vary as much as a 1,000-fold or more in recombination activity. Although much is known about the molecular details of the recombination process itself, the factors determining the location and relative activity of hotspots are poorly understood. To further our understanding, we have collected and mapped the locations of 5,472 crossover events along mouse Chromosome 1 arising in 6,028 meioses of male and female reciprocal F1 hybrids of C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ mice. Crossovers were mapped to a minimum resolution of 225 kb, and those in the telomere-proximal 24.7 Mb were further mapped to resolve individual hotspots. Recombination rates were evolutionarily conserved on a regional scale, but not at the local level. There was a clear negative-exponential relationship between the relative activity and abundance of hotspot activity classes, such that a small number of the most active hotspots account for the majority of recombination. Females had 1.2× higher overall recombination than males did, although the sex ratio showed considerable regional variation. Locally, entirely sex-specific hotspots were rare. The initiation of recombination at the most active hotspot was regulated independently on the two parental chromatids, and analysis of reciprocal crosses indicated that parental imprinting has subtle effects on recombination rates. It appears that the regulation of mammalian recombination is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple factors reflecting species, sex, individual variation within species, and the properties of individual hotspots.
","In most eukaryotic organisms, recombination—the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes—ensures the proper recognition and segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. Recombination events in mammals are not randomly positioned along the chromosomes but occur in preferential 1–2-kilobase sequences termed hotspots. Different species such as humans and mice do not share hotspots, although the same principles almost certainly regulate their placement in the genome. Hotspot positions and activities depend on genetic background and show sex-specific differences. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of recombination activity along the largest mouse chromosome, finding that recombination is regulated on multiple levels, including regional positioning relative to the chromosomal ends, local gene content, sex-specific mechanisms of hotspot recognition, and parental origin. Our results will contribute to further understanding of one of the most fundamental biological processes and are likely to cast light on several aspects of population genetics and evolutionary biology, as well as enhance our practical ability to define the genetic components of human disease.

"Detecting danger is one of the foremost tasks for a neural system. Larval parasitoids constitute clear danger to Drosophila, as up to 80% of fly larvae become parasitized in nature. We show that Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults avoid sites smelling of the main parasitoid enemies, Leptopilina wasps. This avoidance is mediated via a highly specific olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) type. While the larval OSN expresses the olfactory receptor Or49a and is tuned to the Leptopilina odor iridomyrmecin, the adult expresses both Or49a and Or85f and in addition detects the wasp odors actinidine and nepetalactol. The information is transferred via projection neurons to a specific part of the lateral horn known to be involved in mediating avoidance. Drosophila has thus developed a dedicated circuit to detect a life-threatening enemy based on the smell of its semiochemicals. Such an enemy-detecting olfactory circuit has earlier only been characterized in mice and nematodes.
","Detecting danger is a fundamental task for an animal. Larval parasitoids constitute clear danger to the vinegar fly D. melanogaster as up to 80% of fly larvae become parasitized in nature. We show that Drosophila larvae crawl away from places that smell like the main parasitoid enemies, Leptopilina wasps. Furthermore, Drosophila adult females avoid laying eggs at those places. This avoidance is mediated via a highly specific olfactory sensory neuron type that is tuned to detect three odors of the parasitoid, including the wasps sex pheromone iridomyrmecin. We identify the neuron type, the receptors, and the odor ligands that mediate this behavior and also show that this neuronal system is both necessary and sufficient to govern the parasitoid avoidance behavior. We also find evidence that this odor-based Leptopilina wasp avoidance is conserved across several Drosophila species.

"Retinoblastoma (pRb) is a multifunctional regulator, which was likely present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis pRb homolog RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED 1 (RBR1), similar to its animal counterparts, controls not only cell proliferation but is also implicated in developmental decisions, stress responses and maintenance of genome integrity. Although most functions of pRb-type proteins involve chromatin association, a genome-wide understanding of RBR1 binding sites in Arabidopsis is still missing. Here, we present a plant chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol optimized for genome-wide studies of indirectly DNA-bound proteins like RBR1. Our analysis revealed binding of Arabidopsis RBR1 to approximately 1000 genes and roughly 500 transposable elements, preferentially MITES. The RBR1-decorated genes broadly overlap with previously identified targets of two major transcription factors controlling the cell cycle, i.e. E2F and MYB3R3 and represent a robust inventory of RBR1-targets in dividing cells. Consistently, enriched motifs in the RBR1-marked domains include sequences related to the E2F consensus site and the MSA-core element bound by MYB3R transcription factors. Following up a key role of RBR1 in DNA damage response, we performed a meta-analysis combining the information about the RBR1-binding sites with genome-wide expression studies under DNA stress. As a result, we present the identification and mutant characterization of three novel genes required for growth upon genotoxic stress.
","The Retinoblastoma (pRb) tumor suppressor is a master regulator of the cell cycle and its inactivation is associated with many types of cancer. Since pRb’s first description as a transcriptional repressor of genes important for cell cycle progression, many more functions have been elucidated, e.g. in developmental decisions and genome integrity. Homologs of human pRb have been identified in most eukaryotes, including plants, indicating an ancient evolutionary origin of pRb-type proteins. We describe here the first genome-wide DNA-binding study for a plant pRb protein, i.e. RBR1, the only pRb homolog in Arabidopsis thaliana. We see prominent binding of RBR1 to the 5’ region of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, chromatin organization and DNA repair. Moreover, we also reveal extensive binding of RBR1 to specific classes of DNA transposons. Since RBR1 is involved in a plethora of processes, our dataset provides a valuable resource for researches from different fields. As an example, we used our dataset to successfully identify new genes necessary for growth upon DNA damage exerted by drugs such as cisplatin or the environmentally prevalent metal aluminum.

"Pre–mRNAs are often processed in complex patterns in tissue-specific manners to produce a variety of protein isoforms from single genes. However, mechanisms orchestrating the processing of the entire transcript are not well understood. Muscle-specific alternative pre–mRNA processing of the unc-60 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans, encoding two tissue-specific isoforms of ADF/cofilin with distinct biochemical properties in regulating actin organization, provides an excellent in vivo model of complex and tissue-specific pre–mRNA processing; it consists of a single first exon and two separate series of downstream exons. Here we visualize the complex muscle-specific processing pattern of the unc-60 pre–mRNA with asymmetric fluorescence reporter minigenes. By disrupting juxtaposed CUAAC repeats and UGUGUG stretch in intron 1A, we demonstrate that these elements are required for retaining intron 1A, as well as for switching the processing patterns of the entire pre–mRNA from non-muscle-type to muscle-type. Mutations in genes encoding muscle-specific RNA–binding proteins ASD-2 and SUP-12 turned the colour of the unc-60 reporter worms. ASD-2 and SUP-12 proteins specifically and cooperatively bind to CUAAC repeats and UGUGUG stretch in intron 1A, respectively, to form a ternary complex in vitro. Immunohistochemical staining and RT–PCR analyses demonstrate that ASD-2 and SUP-12 are also required for switching the processing patterns of the endogenous unc-60 pre-mRNA from UNC-60A to UNC-60B in muscles. Furthermore, systematic analyses of partially spliced RNAs reveal the actual orders of intron removal for distinct mRNA isoforms. Taken together, our results demonstrate that muscle-specific splicing factors ASD-2 and SUP-12 cooperatively promote muscle-specific processing of the unc-60 gene, and provide insight into the mechanisms of complex pre-mRNA processing; combinatorial regulation of a single splice site by two tissue-specific splicing regulators determines the binary fate of the entire transcript.
","Muscle is a specialized organ with specialized contractile apparatuses. A number of genes encoding contractile apparatus-related proteins undergo muscle-specific pre–mRNA processing. However, the molecular mechanisms and consequences of muscle-specific alternative pre–mRNA processing remain largely unknown. In this study, we reveal regulation mechanisms of pre–mRNA processing of the unc-60 gene locus, encoding two tissue-specific isoforms of ADF/cofilin in C. elegans. The unc-60A and unc-60B genes share only the first exon, and UNC-60B protein is specifically expressed in muscle. We visualize the tissue-specific processing patterns of the unc-60 pre–mRNA with green and red fluorescent proteins in living worms. We provide genetic, biochemical, and immunohistochemical evidence that muscle-specific RNA–binding proteins ASD-2 and SUP-12 cooperatively bind to specific motifs in intron 1A to retain intron 1A, which leads to skipping of exon 2A through 5A and splicing between exon 1 and 2B. Consistently, disruption of the splicing factors leads to expression of UNC-60A in muscle and suppresses paralysis of an unc-60B-specific mutant. Our study raises a model of step-by-step execution of complex co-transcriptional pre–mRNA processing and provides insight into the fate decision of the entire transcript.

"The major transition to eusociality required the evolution of a switch to canalize development into either a reproductive or a helper, the nature of which is currently unknown. Following predictions from the ‘theory of facilitated variation’, we identify sex differentiation pathways as promising candidates because of their pre-adaptation to regulating development of complex phenotypes. We show that conserved core genes, including the juvenile hormone-sensitive master sex differentiation gene doublesex (dsx) and a krüppel homolog 2 (kr-h2) with putative regulatory function, exhibit both sex and morph-specific expression across life stages in the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior. We hypothesize that genes in the sex differentiation cascade evolved perception of alternative input signals for caste differentiation (i.e. environmental or genetic cues), and that their inherent switch-like and epistatic behavior facilitated signal transfer to downstream targets, thus allowing them to control differential development into morphological castes.
","Division of labor into reproductive queens and helper workers in the societies of ants, bees and wasps is achieved by phenotypic plasticity, which allows individuals to embark on discrete developmental trajectories in response to variable signals. These signals can be genetic, epigenetic or environmental, thereby resembling the extreme variation in signals for sex determination across multicellular animals. We show that common developmental pathways downstream of these input signals, including the conserved sex differentiation gene doublesex, regulate sex and caste-specific phenotypic differentiation in the ant species Cardiocondyla obscurior. Many different mechanisms of gene regulation have been implicated in controlling caste-specific development in social insects but these all depend on a higher-level genetic switch. We propose that highly conserved hub genes such as dsx, which can translate variable input signals into large transcription differences using intermediate-level regulators, are tightly linked with the repeated evolutionary transition to eusociality and caste polyphenism.

"In eukaryotes, different subcellular organelles have distinct cholesterol concentrations, which is thought to be critical for biological functions. Oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins (ORPs) have been assumed to mediate nonvesicular cholesterol trafficking in cells; however, their in vivo functions and therefore the biological significance of cholesterol in each organelle are not fully understood. Here, by generating deletion mutants of ORPs in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that ORPs are required for the formation and function of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In an RNAi enhancer screen using obr quadruple mutants (obr-1; -2; -3; -4), we found that MVB–related genes show strong genetic interactions with the obr genes. In obr quadruple mutants, late endosomes/lysosomes are enlarged and membrane protein degradation is retarded, although endocytosed soluble proteins are normally delivered to lysosomes and degraded. We also found that the cholesterol content of late endosomes/lysosomes is reduced in the mutants. In wild-type worms, cholesterol restriction induces the formation of enlarged late endosomes/lysosomes, as observed in obr quadruple mutants, and increases embryonic lethality upon knockdown of MVB–related genes. Finally, we show that knockdown of ORP1L, a mammalian ORP family member, induces the formation of enlarged MVBs in HeLa cells. Our in vivo findings suggest that the proper cholesterol level of late endosomes/lysosomes generated by ORPs is required for normal MVB formation and MVB–mediated membrane protein degradation.
","The multivesicular body (MVB) sorting pathway provides a mechanism for the lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins, such as growth factor receptors. The formation of MVBs is unique in that the curvature is directed toward the lumen of the compartment rather than the cytosol. During MVB formation, the curvature-inducing proteins, such as clathrins, could not be involved in the inward invagination of the endosomal membrane. Under these circumstances, lipids have been assumed to play a role in the membrane invagination step by creating local membrane environments; however, the lipids involved in this step have not been fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that cholesterol, an essential membrane component in animals, is critical for MVB formation and function. We found that disruption of OSBP–related proteins (ORPs), which have been proposed to function in cellular cholesterol distribution and metabolism, reduces the cholesterol content in late endosomes/lysosomes, leading to impaired MVB function. MVB sorting pathway is known to be involved in many processes, including growth factor receptor down-regulation, exosome secretion, antigen presentation, the budding of enveloped viruses, and cytokinesis. Our findings provide a novel link between cholesterol and these biologically important functions.

"We address here the issue of prioritizing non-coding mutations in the tumoral genome. To this aim, we created two independent computational models. The first (germline) model estimates purifying selection based on population SNP data. The second (somatic) model estimates tumor mutation density based on whole genome tumor sequencing. We show that each model reflects a different set of constraints acting either on the normal or tumor genome, and we identify the specific genome features that most contribute to these constraints. Importantly, we show that the somatic mutation model carries independent functional information that can be used to narrow down the non-coding regions that may be relevant to cancer progression. On this basis, we identify positions in non-coding RNAs and the non-coding parts of mRNAs that are both under purifying selection in the germline and protected from mutation in tumors, thus introducing a new strategy for future detection of cancer driver elements in the expressed non-coding genome.
","Cancer cells undergo a mutation/selection process that resembles that of any living cell. Most mutations in cancer cell DNA occur in the so-called ""non-coding"" regions that represent 98.5% of the genome length. Pinning down which of these mutations contribute to the fitness of cancer cells would be important for identifying new ""cancer drivers"", which may in turn lead to future treatments. Unfortunately, predicting the impact of a non-coding DNA alteration remains extremely difficult. In this study, we analyze millions of non-coding cancer mutations and show cancer-specific mutational patterns can be used to predict non-coding regions that are preserved from mutations and may thus be important for cancer cell survival. Combining this information with population data, we propose a new scoring system that should help prioritize important non-coding mutations in future studies.

"Histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs) are involved in chromatin-based regulation of fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis (SMB) in which the corresponding genes—usually physically linked in co-regulated clusters—are silenced under optimal physiological conditions (nutrient-rich) but are activated when nutrients are limiting. The exact molecular mechanisms by which HPTMs influence silencing and activation, however, are still to be better understood. Here we show by a combined approach of quantitative mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and transcriptional network analysis (RNA-seq) that the core regions of silent A. nidulans SM clusters generally carry low levels of all tested chromatin modifications and that heterochromatic marks flank most of these SM clusters. During secondary metabolism, histone marks typically associated with transcriptional activity such as H3 trimethylated at lysine-4 (H3K4me3) are established in some, but not all gene clusters even upon full activation. KdmB, a Jarid1-family histone H3 lysine demethylase predicted to comprise a BRIGHT domain, a zinc-finger and two PHD domains in addition to the catalytic Jumonji domain, targets and demethylates H3K4me3 in vivo and mediates transcriptional downregulation. Deletion of kdmB leads to increased transcription of about ~1750 genes across nutrient-rich (primary metabolism) and nutrient-limiting (secondary metabolism) conditions. Unexpectedly, an equally high number of genes exhibited reduced expression in the kdmB deletion strain and notably, this group was significantly enriched for genes with known or predicted functions in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Taken together, this study extends our general knowledge about multi-domain KDM5 histone demethylases and provides new details on the chromatin-level regulation of fungal secondary metabolite production.
","In this work we monitored by proteomic analysis and ChIP-seq the genome-wide distribution of several key modifications on histone H3 in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans cultivated either under optimal physiological conditions (active growth) or less favourable conditions which are known to promote the production of secondary metabolites (SM). When we correlated the chromatin status to transcriptional activities in actively growing cells we found that the silenced SM gene clusters are flanked by heterochromatic domains presumably contributing to silencing but that the bodies of the clusters only carry background levels of any of the investigated marks. In nutrient-depleted conditions, activating marks were invading some, but by far not all transcribed clusters, leaving open the question how activation of these regions occurs at the chromatin level. Surprisingly, a large number of these gene clusters actually depend on KdmB for normal activation and it will be interesting to see in future how this protein thought to mainly act as repressor by removing positive H3K4m3 marks switches gears to activate transcription directly or indirectly.

"While considered solely an extracellular pathogen, increasing evidence indicates that Pseudomonas aeruginosa encounters intracellular environment in diverse mammalian cell types, including macrophages. In the present study, we have deciphered the intramacrophage fate of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain by live and electron microscopy. P. aeruginosa first resided in phagosomal vacuoles and subsequently could be detected in the cytoplasm, indicating phagosomal escape of the pathogen, a finding also supported by vacuolar rupture assay. The intracellular bacteria could eventually induce cell lysis, both in a macrophage cell line and primary human macrophages. Two bacterial factors, MgtC and OprF, recently identified to be important for survival of P. aeruginosa in macrophages, were found to be involved in bacterial escape from the phagosome as well as in cell lysis caused by intracellular bacteria. Strikingly, type III secretion system (T3SS) genes of P. aeruginosa were down-regulated within macrophages in both mgtC and oprF mutants. Concordantly, cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) level was increased in both mutants, providing a clue for negative regulation of T3SS inside macrophages. Consistent with the phenotypes and gene expression pattern of mgtC and oprF mutants, a T3SS mutant (ΔpscN) exhibited defect in phagosomal escape and macrophage lysis driven by internalized bacteria. Importantly, these effects appeared to be largely dependent on the ExoS effector, in contrast with the known T3SS-dependent, but ExoS independent, cytotoxicity caused by extracellular P. aeruginosa towards macrophages. Moreover, this macrophage damage caused by intracellular P. aeruginosa was found to be dependent on GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) domain of ExoS. Hence, our work highlights T3SS and ExoS, whose expression is modulated by MgtC and OprF, as key players in the intramacrophage life of P. aeruginosa which allow internalized bacteria to lyse macrophages.
","The ability of professional phagocytes to ingest and kill microorganisms is central to host defense and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has developed mechanisms to avoid being killed by phagocytes. While considered an extracellular pathogen, P. aeruginosa has been reported to be engulfed by macrophages in animal models. Here, we visualized the fate of P. aeruginosa within cultured macrophages, revealing macrophage lysis driven by intracellular P. aeruginosa. Two bacterial factors, MgtC and OprF, recently discovered to be involved in the intramacrophage survival of P. aeruginosa, appeared to play a role in this cytotoxicity caused by intracellular bacteria. We provided evidence that type III secretion system (T3SS) gene expression is lowered intracellularly in mgtC and oprF mutants. We further showed that intramacrophage P. aeruginosa uses its T3SS, specifically the ExoS effector, to promote phagosomal escape and cell lysis. We thus describe a transient intramacrophage stage of P. aeruginosa that could contribute to bacterial dissemination.

"African trypanosomes are extracellular protozoan parasites causing a chronic debilitating disease associated with a persistent inflammatory response. Maintaining the balance of the inflammatory response via downregulation of activation of M1-type myeloid cells was previously shown to be crucial to allow prolonged survival. Here we demonstrate that infection with African trypanosomes of IL-27 receptor-deficient (IL-27R-/-) mice results in severe liver immunopathology and dramatically reduced survival as compared to wild-type mice. This coincides with the development of an exacerbated Th1-mediated immune response with overactivation of CD4+ T cells and strongly enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ. What is important is that IL-10 production was not impaired in infected IL-27R-/- mice. Depletion of CD4+ T cells in infected IL-27R-/- mice resulted in a dramatically reduced production of IFN-γ, preventing the early mortality of infected IL-27R-/- mice. This was accompanied by a significantly reduced inflammatory response and a major amelioration of liver pathology. These results could be mimicked by treating IL-27R-/- mice with a neutralizing anti-IFN-γ antibody. Thus, our data identify IL-27 signaling as a novel pathway to prevent early mortality via inhibiting hyperactivation of CD4+ Th1 cells and their excessive secretion of IFN-γ during infection with African trypanosomes. These data are the first to demonstrate the essential role of IL-27 signaling in regulating immune responses to extracellular protozoan infections.
","Infection with extracellular protozoan parasites, African trypanosomes, is characterized by a persistent inflammatory immune response. It has been recently shown that maintaining the balance of the inflammatory responses via dampening M1-type myeloid cell activation is critical to guarantee control of the parasites and survival of the host. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-27 receptor-deficient (IL-27R-/-) mice infected with African trypanosomes developed an excessive inflammatory response and severe liver immunopathology, resulting in dramatically reduced survival, as compared to infected wild-type mice. The early mortality of infected IL-27R-/- mice was correlated with significantly elevated secretions of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ, and enhanced activation of CD4+ Th1 cells. Importantly, IL-10 production was not impaired in infected IL-27R-/- mice. Either depletion of CD4+ T cells, resulting in a dramatically reduced secretion of IFN-γ, or neutralization of IFN-γ, prevented the early mortality of infected IL-27R-/- mice with a significantly reduced inflammatory response and a major amelioration of the liver pathology. Thus, our data identify IL-27 signaling as a novel pathway to prevent the early mortality via inhibiting hyperactivation of CD4+ Th1 cells and their excessive secretions of IFN-γ during experimental infection with extracellular protozoan parasites African trypanosomes.

"Transposable elements represent a large proportion of the eukaryotic genomes. Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are very abundant and constitute the predominant family of transposable elements in plants. Recent studies have identified chromoviruses to be a widely distributed lineage of Gypsy elements. These elements contain chromodomains in their integrases, which suggests a preference for insertion into heterochromatin. In turn, this preference might have contributed to the patterning of heterochromatin observed in host genomes. Despite their potential importance for our understanding of plant genome dynamics and evolution, the regulatory mechanisms governing the behavior of chromoviruses and their activities remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we report a detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal activity of a plant chromovirus in the endogenous host. We examined LORE1a, a member of the endogenous chromovirus LORE1 family from the model legume Lotus japonicus. We found that this chromovirus is stochastically de-repressed in plant populations regenerated from de-differentiated cells and that LORE1a transposes in the male germline. Bisulfite sequencing of the 5′ LTR and its surrounding region suggests that tissue culture induces a loss of epigenetic silencing of LORE1a. Since LTR promoter activity is pollen specific, as shown by the analysis of transgenic plants containing an LTR::GUS fusion, we conclude that male germline-specific LORE1a transposition in pollen grains is controlled transcriptionally by its own cis-elements. New insertion sites of LORE1a copies were frequently found in genic regions and show no strong insertional preferences. These distinctive novel features of LORE1 indicate that this chromovirus has considerable potential for generating genetic and epigenetic diversity in the host plant population. Our results also define conditions for the use of LORE1a as a genetic tool.
","In contrast to animals, where germline differentiation initiates early in embryogenesis, germline differentiation in plants starts in the adult phase during reproductive development. Transpositions of transposable elements in both somatic and gametic cells can be transmitted to the next generation. As a result, plant genomes may contain transposable elements exhibiting a variety of tissue-specific activities. Thus far, the spatio-temporal activity of LTR retrotransposons, the most abundant class of transposable elements in plants, has not been well characterized. Here, we report a detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal transposition pattern of a plant LTR retrotransposon in the endogenous system. Using the model legume Lotus japonicus, we found that LORE1a, a member of the chromovirus LORE1 family that belongs to the Gypsy superfamily, was epigenetically de-repressed via tissue culture. Activation was stochastic and derepression was maintained in regenerated plants. This feature made it possible to trace the original spatio-temporal activity of the retrotransposon in the intact plants. We determined that the plant chromovirus retrotransposes mainly in the male germline, without obvious insertional preferences for chromosomal regions. This finding suggests that the tissue specificity of transposable elements should be taken into account when considering their impact on the host genome dynamics and evolution.

"During the aging process, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) exhibit declined osteogenesis accompanied by excess adipogenesis, which will lead to osteoporosis. Here, we report that the H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), catalyzed by histone methyltransferase SET-domain-containing 2 (SETD2), regulates lineage commitment of BMSCs. Deletion of Setd2 in mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mBMSCs), through conditional Cre expression driven by Prx1 promoter, resulted in bone loss and marrow adiposity. Loss of Setd2 in BMSCs in vitro facilitated differentiation propensity to adipocytes rather than to osteoblasts. Through conjoint analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, we identified a SETD2 functional target gene, Lbp, on which H3K36me3 was enriched, and its expression was affected by Setd2 deficiency. Furthermore, overexpression of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) could partially rescue the lack of osteogenesis and enhanced adipogenesis resulting from the absence of Setd2 in BMSCs. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that the trimethylation level of H3K36 could regulate Lbp transcriptional initiation and elongation. These findings suggest that H3K36me3 mediated by SETD2 could regulate the cell fate of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the regulation of H3K36me3 level by targeting SETD2 and/or the administration of downstream LBP may represent a potential therapeutic way for new treatment in metabolic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis.
","During the aging process, the ability of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the bone marrow to generate bone cells declines, and they become more likely to produce fat cells, resulting in brittle, or osteoporotic, bones. Here, we demonstrate that a histone modification—H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), which is mediated by the enzyme SET-domain-containing 2 (SETD2) and regulates gene expression—plays an essential role in MSC lineage commitment in the bone marrow. We deleted the Setd2 gene in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in mice and found that these mice exhibited reduced bone formation and increased marrow fat accumulation. Notably, we identified Lbp as one of SETD2 functional downstream genes. Overexpression of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) could partially rescue the phenotype of SETD2 deficiency in bone marrow stem cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that H3K36me3 could regulate Lbp transcription by modulating its transcriptional initiation and elongation. Thus, our study provides a new mechanism for MSC fate determination and a therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoporosis.

"Integration of environmental and endogenous cues at plant shoot meristems determines the timing of flowering and reproductive development. The MADS box transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) of Arabidopsis thaliana is an important repressor of floral transition, which blocks flowering until plants are exposed to winter cold. However, the target genes of FLC have not been thoroughly described, and our understanding of the mechanisms by which FLC represses transcription of these targets and how this repression is overcome during floral transition is still fragmentary. Here, we identify and characterize TARGET OF FLC AND SVP1 (TFS1), a novel target gene of FLC and its interacting protein SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). TFS1 encodes a B3-type transcription factor, and we show that tfs1 mutants are later flowering than wild-type, particularly under short days. FLC and SVP repress TFS1 transcription leading to deposition of trimethylation of Iysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 at the TFS1 locus. During floral transition, after downregulation of FLC by cold, TFS1 transcription is promoted by SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), a MADS box protein encoded by another target of FLC/SVP. SOC1 opposes PRC function at TFS1 through recruitment of the histone demethylase RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6) and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler ATPase BRAHMA (BRM). This recruitment of BRM is also strictly required for SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 9 (SPL9) binding at TFS1 to coordinate RNAPII recruitment through the Mediator complex. Thus, we show that antagonistic chromatin modifications mediated by different MADS box transcription factor complexes play a crucial role in defining the temporal and spatial patterns of transcription of genes within a network of interactions downstream of FLC/SVP during floral transition.
","The initiation of flowering in plants is exquisitely sensitive to environmental signals, ensuring that reproduction occurs at the appropriate time of year. The sensitivity of these responses depends upon strong repression of flowering under inappropriate conditions. FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) are related transcription factors that act in concert to strongly inhibit flowering in crucifer plants through repressing transcription of their target genes. Many direct FLC/ SVP targets have been identified in genome-wide studies, however few of these genes have been characterized for their roles in regulating flowering time or other aspects of reproductive development. Here, we characterize TARGET OF FLC AND SVP1 (TFS1) as a novel target of FLC and SVP, and demonstrate that TFS1 contributes to proper flowering-time control. Moreover, we provide a detailed mechanistic view of how TFS1 transcription is controlled during reproductive development through the repressive activity of FLC/SVP being overcome by the transcriptional activator SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1. Thus we further elucidate the network of genes repressed by FLC/SVP to block flowering and determine mechanisms by which their repressive activity is overcome during the initiation of flowering.

"Pregnant women and animals have increased susceptibility to a variety of intracellular pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes (LM), which has been associated with significantly increased level of sex hormones such as progesterone. CD8 T memory(Tm) cell-mediated antigen-non-specific IFN-γ responses are critically required in the host defense against LM. However, whether and how increased progesterone during pregnancy modulates CD8 Tm cell-mediated antigen-non-specific IFN-γ production and immune protection against LM remain poorly understood. Here we show in pregnant women that increased serum progesterone levels are associated with DNA hypermethylation of IFN-γ gene promoter region and decreased IFN-γ production in CD8 Tm cells upon antigen-non-specific stimulation ex vivo. Moreover, IFN-γ gene hypermethylation and significantly reduced IFN-γ production post LM infection in antigen-non-specific CD8 Tm cells are also observed in pregnant mice or progesterone treated non-pregnant female mice, which is a reversible phenotype following demethylation treatment. Importantly, antigen-non-specific CD8 Tm cells from progesterone treated mice have impaired anti-LM protection when adoptive transferred in either pregnant wild type mice or IFN-γ-deficient mice, and demethylation treatment rescues the adoptive protection of such CD8 Tm cells. These data demonstrate that increased progesterone impairs immune protective functions of antigen-non-specific CD8 Tm cells via inducing IFN-γ gene hypermethylation. Our findings thus provide insights into a new mechanism through which increased female sex hormone regulate CD8 Tm cell functions during pregnancy.
","Increased female sex hormones during pregnancy generate a temporary immune suppression status in the pregnant that protect the developing fetus from maternal rejection but renders the pregnant highly susceptible to various pathogens. However, molecular mechanisms underlying such an increased maternal susceptibility to pathogens during pregnancy remain to be further understood. Here we show in pregnant women that increased progesterone levels are associated with IFN-γ gene hypermethylation and reduced IFN-γ production in peripheral CD8 Tm cells. By using murine models of LM infection, for the first time we show a causal relationship between increased level of progesterone, a characteristic female sex hormone of pregnancy, and increased susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular bacterium that endangers both the pregnant and the fetus. Such an impact on anti-listeria host defense is mediated through progesterone-induced IFN-γ gene hypermethylation in CD8 Tm cells, resulting in impaired IFN-γ production and reduced immune protection by antigen-non-specific CD8 Tm cells. This study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens during pregnancy.

"Circadian clocks are endogenous time-keeping systems that temporally organize biological processes. Gating of cell cycle events by a circadian clock is a universal observation that is currently considered a mechanism serving to protect DNA from diurnal exposure to ultraviolet radiation or other mutagens. In this study, we put forward another possibility: that such gating helps to insulate the circadian clock from perturbations induced by transcriptional inhibition during the M phase of the cell cycle. We introduced a periodic pulse of transcriptional inhibition into a previously published mammalian circadian model and simulated the behavior of the modified model under both constant darkness and light–dark cycle conditions. The simulation results under constant darkness indicated that periodic transcriptional inhibition could entrain/lock the circadian clock just as a light–dark cycle does. At equilibrium states, a transcriptional inhibition pulse of certain periods was always locked close to certain circadian phases where inhibition on Per and Bmal1 mRNA synthesis was most balanced. In a light–dark cycle condition, inhibitions imposed at different parts of a circadian period induced different degrees of perturbation to the circadian clock. When imposed at the middle- or late-night phase, the transcriptional inhibition cycle induced the least perturbations to the circadian clock. The late-night time window of least perturbation overlapped with the experimentally observed time window, where mitosis is most frequent. This supports our hypothesis that the circadian clock gates the cell cycle M phase to certain circadian phases to minimize perturbations induced by the latter. This study reveals the hidden effects of the cell division cycle on the circadian clock and, together with the current picture of genome stability maintenance by circadian gating of cell cycle, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of circading gating of cell cycle.
","Circadian clock and cell cycle are two important biological processes that are essential for nearly all eukaryotes. The circadian clock governs day and night 24 h periodic molecular processes and physiological behaviors, while cell cycle controls cell division process. It has been widely observed that cell division does not occur randomly across day and night, but instead is normally confined to specific times during day and night. These observations suggest that cell cycle events are gated by the circadian clock. Regarding the biological benefit and rationale for this intriguing gating phenomena, it has been postulated that circadian gating helps to maintain genome stability by confining radiation-sensitive cell cycle phases to night. Bearing in mind the facts that global transcriptional inhibition occurs at cell division and transcriptional inhibition shifts circadian phases and periods, we postulate that confining cell division to specific circadian times benefits the circadian clock by removing or minimizing the side effects of cell division on the circadian clock. Our results based on computational simulation in this study show that periodic transcriptional inhibition can perturb the circadian clock by altering circadian phases and periods, and the magnitude of the perturbation is clearly circadian phase dependent. Specifically, transcriptional inhibition initiated at certain circadian phases induced minimal perturbation to the circadian clock. These results provide support for our postulation. Our postulation and results point to the importance of the effect of cell division on the circadian clock in the interaction between circadian and cell cycle and suggest that it should be considered together with other factors in the exploitation of circadian cell cycle interaction, especially the phenomena of circadian gating of cell cycle.

"Prion infections cause inexorable, progressive neurological dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Expression of the cellular prion protein PrPC is required for toxicity, suggesting the existence of deleterious PrPC-dependent signaling cascades. Because group-I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) can form complexes with the cellular prion protein (PrPC), we investigated the impact of mGluR1 and mGluR5 inhibition on prion toxicity ex vivo and in vivo. We found that pharmacological inhibition of mGluR1 and mGluR5 antagonized dose-dependently the neurotoxicity triggered by prion infection and by prion-mimetic anti-PrPC antibodies in organotypic brain slices. Prion-mimetic antibodies increased mGluR5 clustering around dendritic spines, mimicking the toxicity of Aβ oligomers. Oral treatment with the mGluR5 inhibitor, MPEP, delayed the onset of motor deficits and moderately prolonged survival of prion-infected mice. Although group-I mGluR inhibition was not curative, these results suggest that it may alleviate the neurological dysfunctions induced by prion diseases.
","Prion diseases are a result of ordered accumulation of the misfolded conformer of cellular prion protein (PrPC), a GPI anchored protein expressed on the cell surface. Similar pathogenetic principles operate in several other neurodegenerative diseases. Currently no disease-modifying therapies exist and the situation is compounded by a dearth of validated therapeutic targets. In our present study, we have discovered that genetic ablation, or pharmacological inhibition, of group-I (i.e. activating) metabotropic glutamate receptors is beneficial against prion neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Mice treated with these inhibitors exhibited impressive suppression of neurological signs and a delayed onset of the symptoms. These results further suggest that activation of these metabotropic glutamate receptors is a downstream event of prion replication and targeting these receptors could be a therapeutic option to alleviate the neurological symptoms, thereby ameliorating the quality of life in patients having prion infection.

"Ribosome biogenesis underpins cell growth and division. Disruptions in ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation are deleterious to development and underlie a spectrum of diseases known collectively as ribosomopathies. Here, we describe a novel zebrafish mutant, titania (ttis450), which harbours a recessive lethal mutation in pwp2h, a gene encoding a protein component of the small subunit processome. The biochemical impacts of this lesion are decreased production of mature 18S rRNA molecules, activation of Tp53, and impaired ribosome biogenesis. In ttis450, the growth of the endodermal organs, eyes, brain, and craniofacial structures is severely arrested and autophagy is up-regulated, allowing intestinal epithelial cells to evade cell death. Inhibiting autophagy in ttis450 larvae markedly reduces their lifespan. Somewhat surprisingly, autophagy induction in ttis450 larvae is independent of the state of the Tor pathway and proceeds unabated in Tp53-mutant larvae. These data demonstrate that autophagy is a survival mechanism invoked in response to ribosomal stress. This response may be of relevance to therapeutic strategies aimed at killing cancer cells by targeting ribosome biogenesis. In certain contexts, these treatments may promote autophagy and contribute to cancer cells evading cell death.
","Autophagy is an act of self-preservation whereby a cell responds to stressful conditions such as nutrient depletion and intense muscular activity by digesting its own cytoplasmic organelles and proteins to fuel its longer-term survival. An understanding of the wide spectrum of physiological stimuli that can trigger this beneficial cellular mechanism is only just starting to emerge. However, this process also has a negative side, since autophagy is exploited in certain pathological conditions, including cancer, to extend the lifespan of cells that would otherwise die. Our analysis of a new zebrafish mutant, titania (ttis450), with defective digestive organs and abnormal craniofacial structure, sheds further light on the physiological and pathological ramifications of autophagy. In (ttis450), an inherited mutation in a gene required for ribosome production provides a powerful stimulus to autophagy in affected tissues, allowing them to evade cell death. The phenotypic consequences of impaired ribosome biogenesis in our zebrafish model are reminiscent of some of the clinical features associated with a group of human syndromes known as ribosomopathies.

"Insulin, the primary hormone regulating the level of glucose in the bloodstream, modulates a variety of cellular and enzymatic processes in normal and diseased cells. Insulin signals are processed by a complex network of biochemical interactions which ultimately induce gene expression programs or other processes such as translation initiation. Surprisingly, despite the wealth of literature on insulin signaling, the relative importance of the components linking insulin with translation initiation remains unclear. We addressed this question by developing and interrogating a family of mathematical models of insulin induced translation initiation. The insulin network was modeled using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. A family of model parameters was estimated, starting from an initial best fit parameter set, using 24 experimental data sets taken from literature. The residual between model simulations and each of the experimental constraints were simultaneously minimized using multiobjective optimization. Interrogation of the model population, using sensitivity and robustness analysis, identified an insulin-dependent switch that controlled translation initiation. Our analysis suggested that without insulin, a balance between the pro-initiation activity of the GTP-binding protein Rheb and anti-initiation activity of PTEN controlled basal initiation. On the other hand, in the presence of insulin a combination of PI3K and Rheb activity controlled inducible initiation, where PI3K was only critical in the presence of insulin. Other well known regulatory mechanisms governing insulin action, for example IRS-1 negative feedback, modulated the relative importance of PI3K and Rheb but did not fundamentally change the signal flow.
","Insulin is a hormone produced by the body that regulates uptake of glucose from the bloodstream. The cellular response to insulin is governed by a complex network of intracellular interactions that ultimately influence cell growth and metabolism. Because of its central role in physiology, insulin signaling has been extensively studied. Yet despite this wealth of research, the relative importance of components in insulin signaling remains unclear. Mechanistic computer simulations have been shown to provide insight into the function of complex systems, such as insulin signaling. In this work we constructed and interrogated a mathematical computer simulation of insulin signaling to better understand the important components of the insulin signaling network. We determined the most important network components and identified network perturbations that can induce dramatic shifts in cellular phenotype. Our results offer an in-depth analysis of the insulin signaling pathway and provide a unique paradigm towards understanding how malfunctions in insulin signaling can result in numerous disease states.

"The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades worldwide, especially in Southeast Asia and the Americas with substantial transmission in 2014–2015. Yet the mechanisms underlying the spatio-temporal circulation of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes at large geographical scales remain elusive. Here we investigate the co-circulation in Asia of DENV serotypes 1–3 from 1956 to 2015, using a statistical framework that jointly estimates migration history and quantifies potential predictors of viral spatial diffusion, including socio-economic, air transportation and maritime mobility data. We find that the spread of DENV-1, -2 and -3 lineages in Asia is significantly associated with air traffic. Our analyses suggest the network centrality of air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India contribute to seeding dengue epidemics, whilst China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore may establish viral diffusion links with multiple countries in Asia. Phylogeographic reconstructions help to explain how growing air transportation networks could influence the dynamics of DENV circulation.
","In the past half century the incidence of dengue fever worldwide has increased 30-fold, with an estimated ~390 million infections per year. The years 2014 and 2015 were characterized by large dengue outbreaks worldwide, which are a threat to public health, especially in Asian countries. Here we use a phylogeographic approach to reconstruct historical virus movement and evaluate multiple potential predictors of the spatial spread of dengue virus (DENV) among Asian countries. We show that air traffic has played a more important role than maritime transport in shaping large-scale geographic dispersal of DENV in Asia. Our study suggests that the patterns of DENV spread result from the interplay between intensity and structure of human mobility through the air transportation network.

"Vector control has substantially reduced Chagas disease (ChD) incidence. However, transmission by household-reinfesting triatomines persists, suggesting that entomological surveillance should play a crucial role in the long-term interruption of transmission. Yet, infestation foci become smaller and harder to detect as vector control proceeds, and highly sensitive surveillance methods are needed. Community participation (CP) and vector-detection devices (VDDs) are both thought to enhance surveillance, but this remains to be thoroughly assessed.
We searched Medline, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, LILACS, SciELO, the bibliographies of retrieved studies, and our own records. Data from studies describing vector control and/or surveillance interventions were extracted by two reviewers. Outcomes of primary interest included changes in infestation rates and the detection of infestation/reinfestation foci. Most results likely depended on study- and site-specific conditions, precluding meta-analysis, but we re-analysed data from studies comparing vector control and detection methods whenever possible. Results confirm that professional, insecticide-based vector control is highly effective, but also show that reinfestation by native triatomines is common and widespread across Latin America. Bug notification by householders (the simplest CP-based strategy) significantly boosts vector detection probabilities; in comparison, both active searches and VDDs perform poorly, although they might in some cases complement each other.
CP should become a strategic component of ChD surveillance, but only professional insecticide spraying seems consistently effective at eliminating infestation foci. Involvement of stakeholders at all process stages, from planning to evaluation, would probably enhance such CP-based strategies.
","Blood-sucking triatomine bugs are the vectors of Chagas disease, a potentially fatal illness that affects millions in Latin America. With no vaccines available, prevention heavily depends on controlling household-infesting triatomines. Insecticide-spraying campaigns have effectively reduced incidence, but persistent household reinfestation can result in disease re-emergence. What, then, is the best strategy to keep houses free of triatomines and thus interrupt disease transmission in the long run? We reviewed published evidence to (i) assess the effectiveness of insecticide-based vector control, gauging the importance of reinfestation; (ii) compare the efficacy of programme-based (with households periodically visited by trained staff) and community-based (with residents reporting suspect vectors found in their homes) surveillance strategies; and (iii) evaluate the performance of alternative vector-detection methods. The results confirm that insecticide-based vector control is highly effective, but also that persistent house reinfestation is a general trend across Latin America. Surveillance systems are significantly more effective when householders report suspect bugs than when programme staff search houses, either manually or using vector-detection devices. Our results clearly support the view that long-term vector surveillance will be necessary for sustained Chagas disease control – and that community participation can substantially contribute to this aim.

"Mycolactone is a lipid-like endotoxin synthesized by an environmental human pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causal agent of Buruli ulcer disease. Mycolactone has pleiotropic effects on fundamental cellular processes (cell adhesion, cell death and inflammation). Various cellular targets of mycolactone have been identified and a literature survey revealed that most of these targets are membrane receptors residing in ordered plasma membrane nanodomains, within which their functionalities can be modulated. We investigated the capacity of mycolactone to interact with membranes, to evaluate its effects on membrane lipid organization following its diffusion across the cell membrane. We used Langmuir monolayers as a cell membrane model. Experiments were carried out with a lipid composition chosen to be as similar as possible to that of the plasma membrane. Mycolactone, which has surfactant properties, with an apparent saturation concentration of 1 μM, interacted with the membrane at very low concentrations (60 nM). The interaction of mycolactone with the membrane was mediated by the presence of cholesterol and, like detergents, mycolactone reshaped the membrane. In its monomeric form, this toxin modifies lipid segregation in the monolayer, strongly affecting the formation of ordered microdomains. These findings suggest that mycolactone disturbs lipid organization in the biological membranes it crosses, with potential effects on cell functions and signaling pathways. Microdomain remodeling may therefore underlie molecular events, accounting for the ability of mycolactone to attack multiple targets and providing new insight into a single unifying mechanism underlying the pleiotropic effects of this molecule. This membrane remodeling may act in synergy with the other known effects of mycolactone on its intracellular targets, potentiating these effects.
","Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing skin disease caused by an environmental mycobacterial pathogen. The pathogenesis of this neglected tropical disease involves the production of a toxin, mycolactone, which spreads through the tissues, away from the infecting organisms. Mycolactone has pleiotropic effects on fundamental cellular processes, resulting in pronounced cytotoxicity and immunosuppressive effects that together drive progressive ulceration. The molecular mechanisms underlying its cellular effects have been partly deciphered, but multiple cellular targets have been identified. A literature survey revealed that most of the identified targets of mycolactone are membrane receptors residing in particular domains of the plasma membrane. Despite its lipid-like nature, mycolactone has been shown to be intracellular, implying that it can cross the plasma membrane. We describe here a surprising membrane-reshaping effect of mycolactone due to effects on lipid domain formation. By reversing lateral lipid segregation, mycolactone may disrupt the formation of domains with well-established roles in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways. This remodeling of the cell plasma membrane may underlie the molecular events enabling mycolactone to attack multiple targets.

"Genetic models of ribosome dysfunction show selective organ failure, highlighting a gap in our understanding of cell-type specific responses to translation insufficiency. Translation defects underlie a growing list of inherited and acquired cancer-predisposition syndromes referred to as ribosomopathies. We sought to identify molecular mechanisms underlying organ failure in a recessive ribosomopathy, with particular emphasis on the pancreas, an organ with a high and reiterative requirement for protein synthesis. Biallelic loss of function mutations in SBDS are associated with the ribosomopathy Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, which is typified by pancreatic dysfunction, bone marrow failure, skeletal abnormalities and neurological phenotypes. Targeted disruption of Sbds in the murine pancreas resulted in p53 stabilization early in the postnatal period, specifically in acinar cells. Decreased Myc expression was observed and atrophy of the adult SDS pancreas could be explained by the senescence of acinar cells, characterized by induction of Tgfβ, p15Ink4b and components of the senescence-associated secretory program. This is the first report of senescence, a tumour suppression mechanism, in association with SDS or in response to a ribosomopathy. Genetic ablation of p53 largely resolved digestive enzyme synthesis and acinar compartment hypoplasia, but resulted in decreased cell size, a hallmark of decreased translation capacity. Moreover, p53 ablation resulted in expression of acinar dedifferentiation markers and extensive apoptosis. Our findings indicate a protective role for p53 and senescence in response to Sbds ablation in the pancreas. In contrast to the pancreas, the Tgfβ molecular signature was not detected in fetal bone marrow, liver or brain of mouse models with constitutive Sbds ablation. Nevertheless, as observed with the adult pancreas phenotype, disease phenotypes of embryonic tissues, including marked neuronal cell death due to apoptosis, were determined to be p53-dependent. Our findings therefore point to cell/tissue-specific responses to p53-activation that include distinction between apoptosis and senescence pathways, in the context of translation disruption.
","Growth of all living things relies on protein synthesis. Failure of components of the complex protein synthesis machinery underlies a growing list of inherited and acquired multi—organ syndromes referred to as ribosomopathies. While ribosomes, the critical working components of the protein synthesis machinery, are required in all cell types to translate the genetic code, only certain organs manifest clinical symptoms in ribosomopathies, indicating specific cell-type features of protein synthesis control. Further, many of these diseases result in cancer despite an inherent deficit in growth. Here we report a range of consequences of protein synthesis insufficiency with loss of a broadly expressed ribosome factor, leading to growth impairment and cell cycle arrest at different stages. Apparent induction of p53-dependent cell death and arrest pathways included apoptosis in the fetal brain and senescence in the mature exocrine pancreas. The senescence, considered a tumour suppression mechanism, was accompanied by the expression of biomarkers associated with early stages of malignant transformation. These findings inform how cancer may initiate when growth is compromised and provide new insights into cell-type specific consequences of protein synthesis insufficiency.

"Grid cells in the rat entorhinal cortex display strikingly regular firing
                    responses to the animal's position in 2-D space and have been
                    hypothesized to form the neural substrate for dead-reckoning. However, errors
                    accumulate rapidly when velocity inputs are integrated in existing models of
                    grid cell activity. To produce grid-cell-like responses, these models would
                    require frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues. Such inadequacies,
                    shared by various models, cast doubt on the dead-reckoning potential of the grid
                    cell system. Here we focus on the question of accurate path integration,
                    specifically in continuous attractor models of grid cell activity. We show, in
                    contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor models can generate
                    regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that encode only the
                    rat's velocity and heading direction. We consider the role of the
                    network boundary in the integration performance of the network and show that
                    both periodic and aperiodic networks are capable of accurate path integration,
                    despite important differences in their attractor manifolds. We quantify the rate
                    at which errors in the velocity integration accumulate as a function of network
                    size and intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range of
                    parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model networks can
                    accurately integrate velocity inputs over a maximum of ∼10–100
                    meters and ∼1–10 minutes. These findings form a
                    proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may underlie velocity
                    integration in the dorsolateral medial entorhinal cortex. The simulations also
                    generate pertinent upper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be
                    achieved by continuous attractor dynamics in the grid cell network. We suggest
                    experiments to test the continuous attractor model and differentiate it from
                    models in which single cells establish their responses independently of each
                    other.
","Even in the absence of external sensory cues, foraging rodents maintain an
                    estimate of their position, allowing them to return home in a roughly straight
                    line. This computation is known as dead reckoning or path integration. A
                    discovery made three years ago in rats focused attention on the dorsolateral
                    medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) as a location in the rat's brain where
                    this computation might be performed. In this area, so-called grid cells fire
                    whenever the rat is on any vertex of a triangular grid that tiles the plane.
                    Here we propose a model that could generate grid-cell-like responses in a neural
                    network. The inputs to the model network convey information about the
                    rat's velocity and heading, consistent with known inputs projecting
                    into the dMEC. The network effectively integrates these inputs to produce a
                    response that depends on the rat's absolute position. We show that such
                    a neural network can integrate position accurately and can reproduce
                    grid-cell-like responses similar to those observed experimentally. We then
                    suggest a set of experiments that could help identify whether our suggested
                    mechanism is responsible for the emergence of grid cells and for path
                    integration in the rat's brain.

"Scrub typhus is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that can be life-threatening. There are no licensed vaccines, or vector control efforts in place. Despite increasing awareness in endemic regions, the public health burden and global distribution of scrub typhus remains poorly known.
We systematically reviewed all literature from public health records, fever studies and reports available on the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase Classic + Embase and EconLit databases, to estimate the burden of scrub typhus since the year 2000.
In prospective fever studies from Asia, scrub typhus is a leading cause of treatable non-malarial febrile illness. Sero-epidemiological data also suggest that Orientia tsutsugamushi infection is common across Asia, with seroprevalence ranging from 9.3%–27.9% (median 22.2% IQR 18.6–25.7). A substantial apparent rise in minimum disease incidence (median 4.6/100,000/10 years, highest in China with 11.2/100,000/10 years) was reported through passive national surveillance systems in South Korea, Japan, China, and Thailand. Case fatality risks from areas of reduced drug-susceptibility are reported at 12.2% and 13.6% for South India and northern Thailand, respectively. Mortality reports vary widely around a median mortality of 6.0% for untreated and 1.4% for treated scrub typhus. Limited evidence suggests high mortality in complicated scrub typhus with CNS involvement (13.6% mortality), multi-organ dysfunction (24.1%) and high pregnancy miscarriage rates with poor neonatal outcomes.
Scrub typhus appears to be a truly neglected tropical disease mainly affecting rural populations, but increasingly also metropolitan areas. Rising minimum incidence rates have been reported over the past 8–10 years from countries with an established surveillance system. A wider distribution of scrub typhus beyond Asia is likely, based on reports from South America and Africa. Unfortunately, the quality and quantity of the available data on scrub typhus epidemiology is currently too limited for any economical, mathematical modeling or mapping approaches.
","Scrub typhus is a mite-transmitted infectious disease that can be life-threatening. Diagnosing this disease is difficult, requiring special techniques that are often not readily available. As the actual impact of scrub typhus on the population and its geographical distribution remains unknown, we searched systematically for available information in medical databases. Scrub typhus is common: more than every fifth person in areas where scrub typhus occurs carry antibodies as a sign of previous contact. All countries with an established surveillance system have recorded an increase in scrub typhus cases over the past 8–10 years, while reports from South America and Africa suggest a wider distribution beyond Asia. Scrub typhus is a serious disease: approximately 6% of cases die if untreated, and 1.5% if treated, but mortality can reach 13% in areas where the usual treatment does not always work well. Death rates of complications are higher, reaching 14% in brain infections, 24% with multiple organ failure, and pregnancies with scrub typhus can have poor outcomes, with high miscarriage rates. Despite many limitations on the amount and quality of available reports, we found that scrub typhus is a severely underappreciated tropical disease, affecting mainly rural populations, but increasingly urban areas as well.

"Intracellular calcium cycling is a vital component of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. The key structures responsible for controlling calcium dynamics are the cell membrane (comprising the surface sarcolemma and transverse-tubules), the intracellular calcium store (the sarcoplasmic reticulum), and the co-localisation of these two structures to form dyads within which calcium-induced-calcium-release occurs. The organisation of these structures tightly controls intracellular calcium dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of intracellular calcium cycling in three-dimensions (3-D), which incorporates high resolution reconstructions of these key regulatory structures, attained through imaging of tissue taken from the sheep left ventricle using serial block face scanning electron microscopy. An approach was developed to model the sarcoplasmic reticulum structure at the whole-cell scale, by reducing its full 3-D structure to a 3-D network of one-dimensional strands. The model reproduces intracellular calcium dynamics during control pacing and reveals the high-resolution 3-D spatial structure of calcium gradients and intracellular fluxes in both the cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrated the capability of the model to reproduce potentially pro-arrhythmic dynamics under perturbed conditions, pertaining to calcium-transient alternans and spontaneous release events. Comparison with idealised cell models emphasised the importance of structure in determining calcium gradients and controlling the spatial dynamics associated with calcium-transient alternans, wherein the probabilistic nature of dyad activation and recruitment was constrained. The model was further used to highlight the criticality in calcium spark propagation in relation to inter-dyad distances. The model presented provides a powerful tool for future investigation of structure-function relationships underlying physiological and pathophysiological intracellular calcium handling phenomena at the whole-cell. The approach allows for the first time direct integration of high-resolution images of 3-D intracellular structures with models of calcium cycling, presenting the possibility to directly assess the functional impact of structural remodelling at the cellular scale.
","The organisation of the membrane and sub-cellular structures of cells in the heart closely controls the coupling between its electrical and mechanical function. Computational models of the cellular calcium handling system, which is responsible for this electro-mechanical coupling, have been developed in recent years to study underlying structure-function relationships. Previous models have been largely idealised in structure; we present a new model which incorporates experimental data describing the high-resolution organisation of the primary structures involved in calcium dynamics. Significantly, the structure of the intracellular calcium store is modelled for the first time. The model is shown to reproduce calcium dynamics in control cells in both normal and abnormal conditions, demonstrating its suitability for future investigation of structure-function relationships. Thus, the model presented provides a powerful tool for the direct integration of experimentally acquired structural data in healthy and diseased cells and assessment of the role of structure in regulating normal and abnormal calcium dynamics.

"The small GTPase RAB-5/Rab5 is a master regulator of the early endosome, required for a myriad of coordinated activities, including the degradation and recycling of internalized cargo. Here we focused on the recycling function of the early endosome and the regulation of RAB-5 by GAP protein TBC-2 in the basolateral C. elegans intestine. We demonstrate that downstream basolateral recycling regulators, GTPase RAB-10/Rab10 and BAR domain protein AMPH-1/Amphiphysin, bind to TBC-2 and help to recruit it to endosomes. In the absence of RAB-10 or AMPH-1 binding to TBC-2, RAB-5 membrane association is abnormally high and recycling cargo is trapped in early endosomes. Furthermore, the loss of TBC-2 or AMPH-1 leads to abnormally high spatial overlap of RAB-5 and RAB-10. Taken together our results indicate that RAB-10 and AMPH-1 mediated down-regulation of RAB-5 is an important step in recycling, required for cargo exit from early endosomes and regulation of early endosome–recycling endosome interactions.
","When cargo is internalized from the cell surface by endocytosis, it enters a series of intracellular organelles called endosomes. Endosomes sort cargo, such that some cargos are sent to the lysosome for degradation, while others are recycled to the plasma membrane. Small GTPase proteins of the Rabs family are master regulators of endosomes, functioning by acting as molecular switches. As cargo moves through the endosomal system, it must pass from the domain controlled by one Rab-GTPase to the domain controlled by another. Little is known about how transitions along the recycling pathway are controlled. Here we analyze a group of protein interactions that act along the early-to-recycling pathway. Our work shows that RAB-5 deactivation mediated by TBC-2 and its recruiters RAB-10 and AMPH-1 is important for cargo recycling. This work provides mechanistic insight into how Rab proteins controlling different steps of trafficking interact during endocytic recycling.

"The intricate interactions between viruses and hosts include an evolutionary arms race and adaptation that is facilitated by the ability of RNA viruses to evolve rapidly due to high frequency mutations and genetic RNA recombination. In this paper, we show evidence that the co-opted cellular DDX3-like Ded1 DEAD-box helicase suppresses tombusviral RNA recombination in yeast model host, and the orthologous RH20 helicase functions in a similar way in plants. In vitro replication and recombination assays confirm the direct role of the ATPase function of Ded1p in suppression of viral recombination. We also present data supporting a role for Ded1 in facilitating the switch from minus- to plus-strand synthesis. Interestingly, another co-opted cellular helicase, the eIF4AIII-like AtRH2, enhances TBSV recombination in the absence of Ded1/RH20, suggesting that the coordinated actions of these helicases control viral RNA recombination events. Altogether, these helicases are the first co-opted cellular factors in the viral replicase complex that directly affect viral RNA recombination. Ded1 helicase seems to be a key factor maintaining viral genome integrity by promoting the replication of viral RNAs with correct termini, but inhibiting the replication of defective RNAs lacking correct 5’ end sequences. Altogether, a co-opted cellular DEAD-box helicase facilitates the maintenance of full-length viral genome and suppresses viral recombination, thus limiting the appearance of defective viral RNAs during replication.
","A major force in virus evolution is the ability of viruses to recombine and change their genomes rapidly. Similar to viral replication that greatly depends on subverted cellular proteins, viral genetic recombination is also affected by host factors based on genome-wide screens with tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) in yeast model host. However, the roles of host factors in the viral genomic RNA recombination process remain elusive. In this paper, we show evidence, in yeast, plants and in vitro, that co-opted cellular helicases by TBSV affect viral recombination through suppressing template-switching and replication of the new recombinant viral RNAs. Based on the presented data, a new concept emerges on the roles of co-opted cellular helicases in maintaining viral genome integrity. Altogether, the hijacked cellular DEAD-box helicases are involved in maintenance of full-length viral RNA genome and suppression of viral RNA recombination, thus blocking the appearance of defective or recombinant viral RNAs during replication.

"Chemotherapy of schistosomiasis relies on a single drug, Praziquantel (PZQ) and mass-use of this compound has led to emergence of resistant strains of Schistosoma mansoni, therefore pointing out the necessity to find alternative drugs. Through their essential functions in development and metabolism, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) could represent valuable drug targets for novel anti-schistosome chemotherapies. Taking advantage of the similarity between the catalytic domains of S. mansoni insulin receptors (SmIR1 and SmIR2) and Venus Kinase Receptors (SmVKR1 and SmVKR2), we studied the possibility to fight schistosomes by targeting simultaneously the four receptors with a single drug.
Several commercial RTK inhibitors were tested for their potential to inhibit the kinase activities of SmIR1, SmIR2, SmVKR1 and SmVKR2 intracellular domains (ICD) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We measured the inhibitory effect of chemicals on meiosis resumption induced by the active ICD of the schistosome kinases in oocytes. The IR inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1024, was the most potent inhibitory compound towards SmIR and SmVKR kinases. In vitro studies then allowed us to show that AG1024 affected the viability of both schistosomula and adult worms of S. mansoni. At micromolar doses, AG1024 induced apoptosis and caused schistosomula death in a dose-dependent manner. In adult worms, AG1024 provoked alterations of reproductive organs, as observed by confocal laser scanner microscopy. With 5 µM AG1024, parasites were no more feeding and laying eggs, and they died within 48 h with 10 µM.
IRs and VKRs are essential in S. mansoni for key biological processes including glucose uptake, metabolism and reproduction. Our results demonstrate that inhibiting the kinase potential and function of these receptors by a single chemical compound AG1024 at low concentrations, leads to death of schistosomula and adult worms. Thus, AG1024 represents a valuable hit compound for further design of anti-kinase drugs applicable to anti-schistosome chemotherapy.
","Schistosomiasis is a chronic, debilitating disease that affects over 200 million people in the world. The pathology of schistosomiasis is caused mainly by host immune responses to parasite eggs and due to the formation of granulomas in liver and other tissues. There is no vaccine for schistosomiasis and treatment relies essentially on a single drug, Praziquantel. However, reduced susceptibility of schistosome isolates to Praziquantel has been reported, raising serious concerns about the need to develop new drugs against schistosomes. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) control many cellular and developmental processes and they are important targets in cancer therapy. In this paper, we have investigated the possibility to fight schistosomes by targeting with a single drug, insulin receptors (IRs) involved in parasite growth and metabolism and Venus Kinase Receptors (VKRs) which are unusual IR-like RTKs expressed in the parasite reproductive organs of Schistosoma mansoni. Diverse RTK inhibitors have been tested on kinase activities of these RTKs. The well-known IR inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1024, was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of both S. mansoni VKRs and IRs, able to induce in vitro death of larvae and adult worms at micromolar doses. AG1024 could represent a good hit compound for the development of novel drugs against schistosomes.

"The neovascular (wet) form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leads to vision loss due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Since macrophages are important in CNV development, and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific IgG serum titers in patients with wet AMD are elevated, we hypothesized that chronic CMV infection contributes to wet AMD, possibly by pro-angiogenic macrophage activation. This hypothesis was tested using an established mouse model of experimental CNV. At 6 days, 6 weeks, or 12 weeks after infection with murine CMV (MCMV), laser-induced CNV was performed, and CNV severity was determined 4 weeks later by analysis of choroidal flatmounts. Although all MCMV-infected mice exhibited more severe CNV when compared with control mice, the most severe CNV developed in mice with chronic infection, a time when MCMV-specific gene sequences could not be detected within choroidal tissues. Splenic macrophages collected from mice with chronic MCMV infection, however, expressed significantly greater levels of TNF-α, COX-2, MMP-9, and, most significantly, VEGF transcripts by quantitative RT-PCR assay when compared to splenic macrophages from control mice. Direct MCMV infection of monolayers of IC-21 mouse macrophages confirmed significant stimulation of VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein as determined by quantitative RT-PCR assay, ELISA, and immunostaining. Stimulation of VEGF production in vivo and in vitro was sensitive to the antiviral ganciclovir. These studies suggest that chronic CMV infection may serve as a heretofore unrecognized risk factor in the pathogenesis of wet AMD. One mechanism by which chronic CMV infection might promote increased CNV severity is via stimulation of macrophages to make pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF), an outcome that requires active virus replication.
","Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the elderly. Onset of AMD is due to local production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes formation of new blood vessels in the retina, thereby leading to retinal tissue destruction and blindness. Since a clinical study by us showed that AMD patients have high amounts of antibodies to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), we postulated that infection with HCMV might be a risk factor for AMD. To investigate this possibility, mice were infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), and at various times after infection, subjected to laser treatment of the eye to induce choroidal neovascularization, an experimental model of AMD. Most severe CNV developed in mice with chronic MCMV infection, a time when MCMV gene sequences could not be detected within eye tissues. However, splenic macrophages collected from mice with chronic MCMV infection produced high levels of gene transcripts to several pro-angiogenic factors including VEGF. MCMV infection of mouse macrophages in culture also produced high amounts of VEGF. Stimulation of VEGF production in vivo and in vitro was sensitive to antiviral treatment. Chronic HCMV infection may therefore promote AMD by stimulation of VEGF production by activated macrophages.

"A complex system of multiple signaling molecules often produce differential gene expression patterns in animal embryos. In the ascidian embryo, four signaling ligands, Ephrin-A.d (Efna.d), Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r, coordinately induce Otx expression in the neural lineage at the 32-cell stage. However, it has not been determined whether differential inputs of all of these signaling pathways are really necessary. It is possible that differential activation of one of these signaling pathways is sufficient and the remaining signaling pathways are activated in all cells at similar levels. To address this question, we developed a parameter-free method for determining a Boolean function for Otx expression in the present study. We treated activities of signaling pathways as Boolean values, and we also took all possible patterns of signaling gradients into consideration. We successfully determined a Boolean function that explains Otx expression in the animal hemisphere of wild-type and morphant embryos at the 32-cell stage. This Boolean function was not inconsistent with three sensing patterns, which represented whether or not individual cells received sufficient amounts of the signaling molecules. These sensing patterns all indicated that differential expression of Otx in the neural lineage is primarily determined by Efna.d, but not by differential inputs of Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r signaling. To confirm this hypothesis experimentally, we simultaneously knocked-down Admp, Gdf1/3-r, and Fgf9/16/20, and treated this triple morphant with recombinant bFGF and BMP4 proteins, which mimic Fgf9/16/20 and Admp/Gdf1/3-r activity, respectively. Although no differential inputs of Admp, Gdf1/3-r and Fgf9/16/20 signaling were expected under this experimental condition, Otx was expressed specifically in the neural lineage. Thus, direct cell–cell interactions through Efna.d play a critical role in patterning the ectoderm of the early ascidian embryo.
","It is often difficult to understand a complex system of multiple signaling molecules in animal embryos only with experimental procedures. Although theoretical analysis might solve this problem, it is often difficult to precisely determine parameters for signaling gradients and kinetics of signaling molecules. In the present study, we developed a parameter-free method for determining a Boolean function for understanding a complex signaling system using gene expression patterns of signaling molecules and geometrical configurations of individual cells within the embryo. In the ascidian embryo, four signaling ligands, Ephrin-A.d (Efna.d), Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r, coordinately induce Otx expression in the neural lineage at the 32-cell stage. In addition to determining a Boolean function, our method determined sensing patterns, which represented whether or not individual cells received sufficient amounts of the signaling molecules. The sensing patterns predicted that differential expression of Otx in the neural lineage is primarily determined by Efna.d, but not by differential inputs of Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r. We confirmed this prediction by an experiment. As a result, we found that only Efna.d signaling pathway is differentially activated between ectodermal cells and the remaining signaling pathways are activated in all ectodermal cells at similar levels.

"The ecological success of social insects is often attributed to an increase in efficiency achieved through division of labor between workers in a colony. Much research has therefore focused on the mechanism by which a division of labor is implemented, i.e., on how tasks are allocated to workers. However, the important assumption that specialists are indeed more efficient at their work than generalist individuals—the “Jack-of-all-trades is master of none” hypothesis—has rarely been tested. Here, I quantify worker efficiency, measured as work completed per time, in four different tasks in the ant Temnothorax albipennis: honey and protein foraging, collection of nest-building material, and brood transports in a colony emigration. I show that individual efficiency is not predicted by how specialized workers were on the respective task. Worker efficiency is also not consistently predicted by that worker's overall activity or delay to begin the task. Even when only the worker's rank relative to nestmates in the same colony was used, specialization did not predict efficiency in three out of the four tasks, and more specialized workers actually performed worse than others in the fourth task (collection of sand grains). I also show that the above relationships, as well as median individual efficiency, do not change with colony size. My results demonstrate that in an ant species without morphologically differentiated worker castes, workers may nevertheless differ in their ability to perform different tasks. Surprisingly, this variation is not utilized by the colony—worker allocation to tasks is unrelated to their ability to perform them. What, then, are the adaptive benefits of behavioral specialization, and why do workers choose tasks without regard for whether they can perform them well? We are still far from an understanding of the adaptive benefits of division of labor in social insects.
","Social insects, including ants, bees, and termites, may make up 75% of the world's insect biomass. This success is often attributed to their complex colony organization. Each individual is thought to specialize in a particular task and thus become an “expert” for this task. Researchers have long assumed that the ecological success of social insects derives from division of labor, just as the increase in productivity achieved in human societies; however, this assumption has not been thoroughly tested. Here, I have measured task performance of specialized and unspecialized ants. In the ant species studied here, it turns out that specialists are no better at their jobs than generalists, and sometimes even perform worse. In addition, most of the work in the colony is not performed by the most efficient workers. So the old adage “The Jack of all trades is a master of none” does not seem to apply to these ants, suggesting that we may have to revise our understanding of the benefits of colony organization.

"Plague in Brazil is poorly known and now rarely seen, so studies of its ecology are difficult. We used ecological niche models of historical (1966-present) records of human plague cases across northeastern Brazil to assess hypotheses regarding environmental correlates of plague occurrences across the region. Results indicate that the apparently focal distribution of plague in northeastern Brazil is indeed discontinuous, and that the causes of the discontinuity are not necessarily only related to elevation—rather, a diversity of environmental dimensions correlate to presence of plague foci in the region. Perhaps most interesting is that suitable areas for plague show marked seasonal variation in photosynthetic mass, with peaks in April and May, suggesting links to particular land cover types. Next steps in this line of research will require more detailed and specific examination of reservoir ecology and natural history.
","We analyzed the spatial and environmental distributions of human plague cases across northeastern Brazil from 1966-present, where the disease is now only rarely transmitted to humans, but persists as a zoonosis of native rodent populations. We elucidated environmental correlates of plague occurrences by way of ecological niche modeling techniques utilizing advanced satellite imagery and geospatial datasets to better understand the ecology and geography of the transmission of plague. Our analysis indicates that plague foci in Brazil are indeed insular as previously suggested. Furthermore, distribution of such foci are likely not directly dependent on elevation, and rather are contigent on climate and vegetation. Seasonality of zoonotic plague transmission is linked to variations of these ecological parameters- particularly the increase in precipitation and primary production of the rainy season. Spatial analysis of transmission events afford a broad view of potential plague foci distributions across northeastern Brazil and indicate that the epidemiology of plague is driven by a dynamic array of environmental factors.

"Control of the Riverine (Palpalis) group of tsetse flies is normally achieved with stationary artificial devices such as traps or insecticide-treated targets. The efficiency of biconical traps (the standard control device), 1×1 m black targets and small 25×25 cm targets with flanking nets was compared using electrocuting sampling methods. The work was done on Glossina tachinoides and G. palpalis gambiensis (Burkina Faso), G. fuscipes quanzensis (Democratic Republic of Congo), G. f. martinii (Tanzania) and G. f. fuscipes (Kenya). The killing effectiveness (measured as the catch per m2 of cloth) for small targets plus flanking nets is 5.5–15X greater than for 1 m2 targets and 8.6–37.5X greater than for biconical traps. This has important implications for the costs of control of the Riverine group of tsetse vectors of sleeping sickness.
","Sleeping Sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis) is a serious threat to health and development in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently there are no vaccines or prophylactic drugs available to prevent contraction of the disease. Consequently vector control is the only method of disease prevention. In many areas, especially those lacking high densities of cattle, the only control option for routine use against tsetse flies are insecticide-treated targets or biconical traps. However, these methods in their current form are often too expensive for routine use against the riverine tsetse species that are the major vectors of sleeping sickness. Our aim is to develop a more cost-effective device than those currently available. Working on four species of tsetse fly we have shown that a small 25×25 cm target with adjacent flanking net was up to 38x more cost-effective at killing tsetse flies than existing devices. These findings suggest that this new technology may make vector control in HAT foci an affordable option.

"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, aggressive form of breast cancer associated with HER2 amplification, with high risk of metastasis and an estimated median survival of 2.9 y. We performed an open-label, single-arm phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01325428) to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family inhibitor, alone and in combination with vinorelbine in patients with HER2-positive IBC. This trial included prospectively planned exome analysis before and after afatinib monotherapy.
HER2-positive IBC patients received afatinib 40 mg daily until progression, and thereafter afatinib 40 mg daily and intravenous vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 weekly. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit; secondary endpoints were objective response (OR), duration of OR, and progression-free survival (PFS). Of 26 patients treated with afatinib monotherapy, clinical benefit was achieved in 9 patients (35%), 0 of 7 trastuzumab-treated patients and 9 of 19 trastuzumab-naïve patients. Following disease progression, 10 patients received afatinib plus vinorelbine, and clinical benefit was achieved in 2 of 4 trastuzumab-treated and 0 of 6 trastuzumab-naïve patients. All patients had treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Whole-exome sequencing of tumour biopsies taken before treatment and following disease progression on afatinib monotherapy was performed to assess the mutational landscape of IBC and evolutionary trajectories during therapy. Compared to a cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patients with HER2-positive non-IBC, HER2-positive IBC patients had significantly higher mutational and neoantigenic burden, more frequent gain-of-function TP53 mutations and a recurrent 11q13.5 amplification overlapping PAK1. Planned exploratory analysis revealed that trastuzumab-naïve patients with tumours harbouring somatic activation of PI3K/Akt signalling had significantly shorter PFS compared to those without (p = 0.03). High genomic concordance between biopsies taken before and following afatinib resistance was observed with stable clonal structures in non-responding tumours, and evidence of branched evolution in 8 of 9 tumours analysed. Recruitment to the trial was terminated early following the LUX-Breast 1 trial, which showed that afatinib combined with vinorelbine had similar PFS and OR rates to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine but shorter overall survival (OS), and was less tolerable. The main limitations of this study are that the results should be interpreted with caution given the relatively small patient cohort and the potential for tumour sampling bias between pre- and post-treatment tumour biopsies.
Afatinib, with or without vinorelbine, showed activity in trastuzumab-naïve HER2-positive IBC patients in a planned subgroup analysis. HER2-positive IBC is characterized by frequent TP53 gain-of-function mutations and a high mutational burden. The high mutational load associated with HER2-positive IBC suggests a potential role for checkpoint inhibitor therapy in this disease.
ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01325428
","Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and poorly understood form of breast cancer that grows and spreads very quickly. Fifty percent of IBC cases are HER2-positive.
Afatinib is an investigational drug that showed promise in early-stage trials in the setting of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Our study was designed to look at how effective and safe afatinib is in treating HER2-positive IBC patients, and to elucidate how afatinib treatment affects the tumours at the genomic level.
We recruited 26 patients for this study and administered afatinib daily, and 10 patients went on to be treated with daily afatinib and weekly vinorelbine, a chemotherapy drug, upon disease progression.
Thirty-five percent (9 of 26) and 20% (2 of 10) of patients had clinical benefit from being treated with afatinib monotherapy and afatinib plus vinorelbine, respectively.
We sequenced tumour biopsies before and after afatinib treatment and found that IBC has a higher mutational load and more frequent mutations in the well-known cancer gene TP53, compared to non-IBC.
We did not identify any single gene or mutation that led to afatinib resistance, and biopsies before and after treatment were very similar genetically.
Afatinib appears to be clinically active in HER2-positive IBC, albeit in a relatively small patient cohort.
The high mutational load in IBC suggests that checkpoint inhibitors, a type of cancer immunotherapy, might potentially be an effective way of treating patients.

"16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of OTU-OTU relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, SPIEC-EASI is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate OTU count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.
","Genomic survey of microbes by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics has inspired appreciation for the role of complex communities in diverse ecosystems. However, due to the unique properties of community composition data, standard data analysis tools are likely to produce statistical artifacts. For a typical experiment studying microbial ecosystems these artifacts can lead to erroneous conclusions about patterns of associations between microbial taxa. We developed a new procedure that seeks to infer ecological associations between microbial populations, by 1) taking advantage of the proportionality invariance of relative abundance data and 2) making assumptions about the underlying network structure when the number of taxa in the dataset is larger than the number of sampled communities. Additionally, we employed a novel tool to generate biologically plausible synthetic data and objectively benchmark current association inference tools. Finally, we tested our procedures on a large-scale 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset sampled from the human gut.

"The proteasome inhibitor MG132 had been shown to prevent galactose induction of the S. cerevisiae GAL1 gene, demonstrating that ubiquitin proteasome-dependent degradation of transcription factors plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. The deletion of the gene encoding the F-box protein Mdm30 had been reported to stabilize the transcriptional activator Gal4 under inducing conditions and to lead to defects in galactose utilization, suggesting that recycling of Gal4 is required for its function. Subsequently, however, it was argued that Gal4 remains stably bound to the enhancer under inducing conditions, suggesting that proteolytic turnover of Gal4 might not be required for its function. We have performed an alanine-scanning mutagenesis of ubiquitin and isolated a galactose utilization-defective ubiquitin mutant. We have used it for an unbiased suppressor screen and identified the inhibitor Gal80 as a suppressor of the transcriptional defects of the ubiquitin mutant, indicating that the protein degradation of the inhibitor Gal80, and not of the activator Gal4, is required for galactose induction of the GAL genes. We also show that in the absence of Gal80, Mdm30 is not required for Gal4 function, strongly supporting this hypothesis. Furthermore, we have found that Mediator controls the galactose-induced protein degradation of Gal80, which places Mediator genetically upstream of the activator Gal4. Mediator had originally been isolated by its ability to respond to transcriptional activators, and here we have discovered a leading role for Mediator in the process of transcription. The protein kinase Snf1 senses the inducing conditions and transduces the signal to Mediator, which initiates the degradation of the inhibitor Gal80 with the help of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFMdm30. The ability of Mediator to control the protein degradation of transcriptional inhibitors indicates that Mediator is actually able to direct its own recruitment to gene promoters.
","The expression levels of proteins are tightly regulated, not only via their production but also via their degradation. Genes are transcribed only if their encoded proteins are required by the environmental or developmental conditions of a cell, and once a certain protein is no longer needed, it is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Transcriptional activators appeared to contradict this simple economic principle, as it had been claimed that they had to be degraded in order to function. The claim was based upon a correlation: if the degradation of an activator was prevented by drugs or mutations in the UPS, the activator became stable but also nonfunctional. We have now shown that it is not the activator itself but its inhibitor that is the functionally relevant target of the UPS. Furthermore, we have found that the degradation of the inhibitor is controlled by a protein complex called Mediator. The activator is known to recruit Mediator to gene promoters, where Mediator assists RNA polymerase in initiating transcription. Mediator was always considered to be completely under the control of the activator; however, we observe that by regulating the degradation of the inhibitor, Mediator is also able to control the activator and thereby to orchestrate its own recruitment to gene promoters.

"There is considerable variability in the susceptibility of smokers to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The only known genetic risk factor is severe deficiency of α1-antitrypsin, which is present in 1–2% of individuals with COPD. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a homogenous case-control cohort from Bergen, Norway (823 COPD cases and 810 smoking controls) and evaluated the top 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the family-based International COPD Genetics Network (ICGN; 1891 Caucasian individuals from 606 pedigrees) study. The polymorphisms that showed replication were further evaluated in 389 subjects from the US National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) and 472 controls from the Normative Aging Study (NAS) and then in a fourth cohort of 949 individuals from 127 extended pedigrees from the Boston Early-Onset COPD population. Logistic regression models with adjustments of covariates were used to analyze the case-control populations. Family-based association analyses were conducted for a diagnosis of COPD and lung function in the family populations. Two SNPs at the α-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA 3/5) locus were identified in the genome-wide association study. They showed unambiguous replication in the ICGN family-based analysis and in the NETT case-control analysis with combined p-values of 1.48×10−10, (rs8034191) and 5.74×10−10 (rs1051730). Furthermore, these SNPs were significantly associated with lung function in both the ICGN and Boston Early-Onset COPD populations. The C allele of the rs8034191 SNP was estimated to have a population attributable risk for COPD of 12.2%. The association of hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) locus on chromosome 4 was also consistently replicated, but did not reach genome-wide significance levels. Genome-wide significant association of the HHIP locus with lung function was identified in the Framingham Heart study (Wilk et al., companion article in this issue of PLoS Genetics; doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000429). The CHRNA 3/5 and the HHIP loci make a significant contribution to the risk of COPD. CHRNA3/5 is the same locus that has been implicated in the risk of lung cancer.
","There is considerable variability in the susceptibility of smokers to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a heritable multi-factorial trait. Identifying the genetic determinants of COPD risk will have tremendous public health importance. This study describes the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) in COPD. We conducted a GWAS in a homogenous case-control cohort from Norway and evaluated the top 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the family-based International COPD Genetics Network. The polymorphisms that showed replication were further evaluated in subjects from the US National Emphysema Treatment Trial and controls from the Normative Aging Study and then in a fourth cohort of extended pedigrees from the Boston Early-Onset COPD population. Two polymorphisms in the α-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 3/5 locus on chromosome 15 showed unambiguous evidence of association with COPD. This locus has previously been implicated in both smoking behavior and risk of lung cancer, suggesting the possibility of multiple functional polymorphisms in the region or a single polymorphism with wide phenotypic consequences. The hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) locus on chromosome 4, which is associated with COPD, is also a significant risk locus for COPD.

"Blastomyces adhesin-1 (BAD-1) is a 120-kD surface protein on B. dermatitidis yeast. We show here that BAD-1 contains 41 tandem repeats and that deleting even half of them impairs fungal pathogenicity. According to NMR, the repeats form tightly folded 17-amino acid loops constrained by a disulfide bond linking conserved cysteines. Each loop contains a highly conserved WxxWxxW motif found in thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) type 1 heparin-binding repeats. BAD-1 binds heparin specifically and saturably, and is competitively inhibited by soluble heparin, but not related glycosaminoglycans. According to SPR analysis, the affinity of BAD-1 for heparin is 33 nM±14 nM. Putative heparin-binding motifs are found both at the N-terminus and within each tandem repeat loop. Like TSP-1, BAD-1 blocks activation of T cells in a manner requiring the heparan sulfate-modified surface molecule CD47, and impairs effector functions. The tandem repeats of BAD-1 thus confer pathogenicity, harbor motifs that bind heparin, and suppress T-cell activation via a CD47-dependent mechanism, mimicking mammalian TSP-1.
","Work on fungi is of worldwide importance due to the increasing burden of diseases caused by these agents in humans, plants and animals globally and throughout our ecosystem. The human pathogen Blastomyces dermatitidis harbors an essential virulence factor BAD-1. We describe new structural and functional features of BAD-1 that account for fungus' ability to cause disease. BAD-1 harbors a repetitive domain – a tandem repeat - that is present in up to 41 copies in the protein and essential in pathogenesis. We report an example of mimicry between this BAD-1 repeat and mammalian thrombospondin type-1 (TSP-1), a molecule that helps regulate human immunity. BAD-1 tandem repeats shares a tryptophan-rich sequence with TSP-1 that binds to tissue matrix and circulating immune cells. Like TSP-1, BAD-1 binds to this matrix. Through this property, BAD-1 binds and retards the action of white blood cells that fight fungal infection. Thus, we describe how fungi have evolved the means to mimic molecules that mammals commonly use to dampen unwanted immune responses, thus promoting pathogen survival.

"No therapeutics or vaccines currently exist for human coronaviruses (HCoVs). The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002–2003, and the recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, emphasize the high probability of future zoonotic HCoV emergence causing severe and lethal human disease. Additionally, the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin (RBV) demonstrates the need to define new targets for inhibition of CoV replication. CoVs express a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication and is conserved across the CoV family. All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. We demonstrate that while wild-type (ExoN+) CoVs were resistant to RBV and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN−) were up to 300-fold more sensitive. While the primary antiviral activity of RBV against CoVs was not mutagenesis, ExoN− CoVs treated with 5-FU demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi-cycle replication, as well as decreased specific infectivity, consistent with 5-FU functioning as a mutagen. Comparison of full-genome next-generation sequencing of 5-FU treated SARS-CoV populations revealed a 16-fold increase in the number of mutations within the ExoN− population as compared to ExoN+. Ninety percent of these mutations represented A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis. Together our results constitute direct evidence that CoV ExoN activity provides a critical proofreading function during virus replication. Furthermore, these studies identify ExoN as the first viral protein distinct from the RdRp that determines the sensitivity of RNA viruses to mutagens. Finally, our results show the importance of ExoN as a target for inhibition, and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.
","RNA viruses have high mutation rates (10−3 to 10−5 mutations/nucleotide/round of replication), allowing for rapid viral adaptation in response to selective pressure. While RNA viruses have long been considered unable to correct mistakes during replication, CoVs such as SARS-CoV and the recently emerged MERS-CoV are important exceptions to this paradigm. All CoVs encode an exoribonuclease activity in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is proposed to prevent and/or remove misincorporated nucleotides. Because of the demonstrated resistance of SARS-CoV to the antiviral drug ribavirin (RBV), we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. Using RBV and the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), we show that CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN−) are highly susceptible to RBV and 5-FU, in contrast to wild-type (ExoN+) CoVs. The inhibitory activity of 5-FU against ExoN− viruses resulted specifically from 5-FU incorporation during viral RNA synthesis that lead to extensive mutagenesis within the viral population, and was associated with a profound decrease in virus specific infectivity. These results demonstrate the proofreading activity of ExoN during virus replication and suggest that inhibitors of ExoN activity could be broadly useful inhibitors of CoV replication in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.

"Influenza virus particles are assembled at the plasma membrane in concert with incorporation of the virus genome, but the details of its spatio-temporal regulation are not understood. Here we showed that influenza virus infection induces the assembly of pericentrosomal endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) through the activation of Rab11a GTPase and cell cycle-independent maturation of centrosome by YB-1, a multifunctional protein that is involved in mitotic division, RNA metabolism and tumorigenesis. YB-1 is recruited to the centrosome in infected cells and is required for anchoring microtubules to the centrosome. We also found that viral infection accumulates cholesterol in ERC and is dependent on YB-1. Depletion of YB-1 shows reduced cholesterol-enriched ERC and prevented budozone formation at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that cholesterol in recycling endosomes, which are emanated from ERC, may trigger the virus assembly concomitantly with the packaging of the virus genome. We propose that the virus genome is transported to the plasma membrane by cholesterol-enriched recycling endosomes through cell cycle-independent activation of the centrosome by YB-1.

"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is associated with increased circulating levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-12, IFNγ, and TNFα, and elevated expression of IFNγ mRNA in lesional tissue such as the spleen and bone marrow. However, an immunological feature of VL patients is that their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) typically fail to respond to stimulation with leishmanial antigen. Unexpectedly, it was recently shown that Leishmania specific IFNγ, can readily be detected when a whole blood stimulation assay (WBA) is used. We sought to define the conditions that permit whole blood cells to respond to antigen stimulation, and clarify the biological role of the IFNγ found to be released by cells from VL patients. CD4+ T cells were found to be crucial for and the main source of the IFNγ production in Leishmania stimulated whole blood (WB) cultures. Complement, antibodies and red blood cells present in whole blood do not play a significant role in the IFNγ response. The IFNγ production was reduced by blockade of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, indicating that the response to leishmanial antigens observed in WB of active VL patients is a classical HLA- T cell receptor (TCR) driven reaction. Most importantly, blockade of IFNγ in ex-vivo splenic aspirate cultures demonstrated that despite the progressive nature of their disease, the endogenous IFNγ produced in patients with active VL serves to limit parasite growth.
","Our research aims to understand the immune failure underlying progression of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). A key immunological feature of VL patients is that their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) do not respond to stimulation with leishmanial antigen. Surprisingly, when employing a whole blood assay we discovered significant levels of IFNγ in response to soluble Leishmania donovani antigen (WBA) in VL patients. We were interested to understand the relevance of the IFNγ to the anti-parasitic response. Animal models and in vitro studies have shown that IFNγ is a key effector cytokine required for control of the infection, however, the role of endogenous IFNγ in control of parasites in VL patients, has not been demonstrated. Our results show that CD4 cells were required for and were the source of Leishmania specific IFNγ in WBA of VL patients. Optimal IFNγ response required interaction with HLA-DR, supporting that VL is not due to an intrinsic Th1 response defect per se. The Leishmania driven IFNγ appears to limit parasite growth in patients with active VL, since blockade of IFNγ ex-vivo in splenic aspirate cultures enhanced parasite survival. This suggests that IFNγ may have been prematurely dismissed as an adjunct therapy in treatment of VL.

"Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), the second most common subtype of lung cancer, is strongly associated with tobacco smoking and exhibits genomic instability. The cellular origins and molecular processes that contribute to SqCC formation are largely unexplored. Here we show that human basal stem cells (BSCs) isolated from heavy smokers proliferate extensively, whereas their alveolar progenitor cell counterparts have limited colony-forming capacity. We demonstrate that this difference arises in part because of the ability of BSCs to repair their DNA more efficiently than alveolar cells following ionizing radiation or chemical-induced DNA damage. Analysis of mice harbouring a mutation in the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a key enzyme in DNA damage repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), indicated that BSCs preferentially repair their DNA by this error-prone process. Interestingly, polyploidy, a phenomenon associated with genetically unstable cells, was only observed in the human BSC subset. Expression signature analysis indicated that BSCs are the likely cells of origin of human SqCC and that high levels of NHEJ genes in SqCC are correlated with increasing genomic instability. Hence, our results favour a model in which heavy smoking promotes proliferation of BSCs, and their predilection for error-prone NHEJ could lead to the high mutagenic burden that culminates in SqCC. Targeting DNA repair processes may therefore have a role in the prevention and therapy of SqCC.
","Human lungs are constantly exposed to inhaled chemicals that have the potential to damage cellular DNA. Lung stem cells must therefore have the ability to repair DNA damage to survive and achieve tissue homeostasis. Lung airways are composed of different types of cells, including basal cells, which have been proposed to be the stem cells of the lung. Here, we show that lung basal stem cells have a superior ability to resolve DNA damage compared to alveolar progenitor cells, thus allowing these cells to survive and proliferate after injury. Accordingly, basal stem cells isolated from patients with a long history of tobacco smoking had remarkable proliferative potential compared to those extracted from never smokers. However, we demonstrate that basal stem cells predominately use nonhomologous end joining to repair DNA double-strand breaks, a notoriously error-prone pathway. A subset of polyploid basal stem cells was observed in cigarette-smoking patients, pointing to the accumulation of genetic instability in these long-lived cells. Gene expression analyses revealed that lung squamous cell carcinoma, a subtype of lung cancer that almost exclusively occurs in smokers, carries a transcriptional fingerprint of basal cells, suggesting that lung basal stem cells could be the cells of origin of this subtype of lung cancer. We postulate that further unravelling of DNA repair in lung cells may lead to potential therapeutic targets in the prevention or treatment of lung diseases.

"Unlike in most pathogens, multiple-strain (polygenomic) infections of P. falciparum are frequently composed of genetic siblings. These genetic siblings are the result of sexual reproduction and can coinfect the same host when cotransmitted by the same mosquito. The degree with which coinfecting strains are related varies among infections and populations. Because sexual recombination occurs within the mosquito, the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could depend on transmission dynamics, but little is actually known of the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. Part of the uncertainty stems from an incomplete understanding of how within-host and within-vector dynamics affect cotransmission. Cotransmission is difficult to examine experimentally but can be explored using a computational model. We developed a malaria transmission model that simulates sexual reproduction in order to understand what determines the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. This study highlights how the relatedness of cotransmitted strains depends on both within-host and within-vector dynamics including the complexity of infection. We also used our transmission model to analyze the genetic relatedness of polygenomic infections following a series of multiple transmission events and examined the effects of superinfection. Understanding the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could lead to a better understanding of the population-genetic correlates of transmission and therefore be important for public health.
","Genomic studies of P. falciparum reveal that multi-strain infections can include genetically related strains. P. falciparum must reproduce sexually in the mosquito vector. One consequence of sexual reproduction is that parasites cotransmitted by the same mosquito are related to one another. The degree of genetic relatedness of these parasites can be as great as that of full-siblings. However, our understanding of the cotransmission process is incomplete, and little is known of the role of cotransmission in influencing population genomic processes. To help bridge this gap, we developed a simulation model to determine which of the steps involved in transmission have the greatest impact on the relatedness of parasites cotransmitted by a mosquito vector. The primary goal of this study is to characterize the outcomes of cotransmission following single or multiple transmission events. Our model yields new insights into the cotransmission process, which we believe will be useful for understanding the results from more complicated population models and epidemiological conditions. Such an understanding is important for the use of population genomics to inform public health decisions as well as for understanding of parasite evolution.

"The CDKN1B gene encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1, an atypical tumor suppressor playing a key role in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Impaired p27KIP1 expression and/or localization are often observed in tumor cells, further confirming its central role in regulating the cell cycle. Recently, germline mutations in CDKN1B have been associated with the inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 4, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by varying combinations of tumors affecting at least two endocrine organs. In this study we identified a 4-bp deletion in a highly conserved regulatory upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5′UTR of the CDKN1B gene in a patient with a pituitary adenoma and a well-differentiated pancreatic neoplasm. This deletion causes the shift of the uORF termination codon with the consequent lengthening of the uORF–encoded peptide and the drastic shortening of the intercistronic space. Our data on the immunohistochemical analysis of the patient's pancreatic lesion, functional studies based on dual-luciferase assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and on polysome profiling show a negative influence of this deletion on the translation reinitiation at the CDKN1B starting site, with a consequent reduction in p27KIP1 expression. Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to the previously described mechanisms leading to reduced p27KIP1 activity, such as degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway or non-covalent sequestration, p27KIP1 activity can also be modulated by an uORF and mutations affecting uORF could change p27KIP1 expression. This study adds the CDKN1B gene to the short list of genes for which mutations that either create, delete, or severely modify their regulatory uORFs have been associated with human diseases.
","Gene expression can be modulated at different steps on the way from DNA to protein including control of transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications. An abnormality in the regulation of mRNA and protein expression is a hallmark of many human diseases, including cancer. In some eukaryotic genes translation can be influenced by small DNA sequences termed upstream open reading frames (uORFs). These elements located upstream to the gene start codon may either negatively influence the ability of the translational machinery to reinitiate translation of the main protein or, much less frequently, stimulate protein translation by enabling the ribosomes to bypass cis-acting inhibitory elements. CDKN1B, which encodes the cell cycle inhibitor p27KIP1, includes an uORF in its 5′UTR sequence. p27KIP1 expression is often reduced in cancer, and germline mutations have been identified in CDKN1B in patients affected with a syndrome (MEN4) characterized by varying combinations of tumors in endocrine glands. Here we show that a small deletion in the uORF upstream to CDKN1B reduces translation reinitiation efficiency, leading to underexpression of p27KIP1 and coinciding with tumorigenesis. This study describes a novel mechanism by which p27KIP1 could be underexpressed in human tumors. In addition, our data provide a new insight to the unique pathogenic potential of uORFs in human diseases.

"Establishing the sources of reinfestation after residual insecticide spraying is crucial for vector elimination programs. Triatoma infestans, traditionally considered to be limited to domestic or peridomestic (abbreviated as D/PD) habitats throughout most of its range, is the target of an elimination program that has achieved limited success in the Gran Chaco region in South America.
During a two-year period we conducted semi-annual searches for triatomine bugs in every D/PD site and surrounding sylvatic habitats after full-coverage spraying of pyrethroid insecticides of all houses in a well-defined rural area in northwestern Argentina. We found six low-density sylvatic foci with 24 T. infestans in fallen or standing trees located 110–2,300 m from the nearest house or infested D/PD site detected after insecticide spraying, when house infestations were rare. Analysis of two mitochondrial gene fragments of 20 sylvatic specimens confirmed their species identity as T. infestans and showed that their composite haplotypes were the same as or closely related to D/PD haplotypes. Population studies with 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci and wing geometric morphometry consistently indicated the occurrence of unrestricted gene flow between local D/PD and sylvatic populations. Mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite sibship analyses in the most abundant sylvatic colony revealed descendents from five different females. Spatial analysis showed a significant association between two sylvatic foci and the nearest D/PD bug population found before insecticide spraying.
Our study shows that, despite of its high degree of domesticity, T. infestans has sylvatic colonies with normal chromatic characters (not melanic morphs) highly connected to D/PD conspecifics in the Argentinean Chaco. Sylvatic habitats may provide a transient or permanent refuge after control interventions, and function as sources for D/PD reinfestation. The occurrence of sylvatic foci of T. infestans in the Gran Chaco may pose additional threats to ongoing vector elimination efforts.
","Triatoma infestans, a highly domesticated species and historically the main vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, is the target of an insecticide-based elimination program in the southern cone countries of South America since 1991. Only limited success has been achieved in the Gran Chaco region due to repeated reinfestations. We conducted full-coverage spraying of pyrethroid insecticides of all houses in a well-defined rural area in northwestern Argentina, followed by intense monitoring of house reinfestation and searches for triatomine bugs in sylvatic habitats during the next two years, to establish the putative sources of new bug colonies. We found low-density sylvatic foci of T. infestans in trees located within the species' flight range from the nearest infested house detected before control interventions. Using multiple methods (fine-resolution satellite imagery, geographic information systems, spatial statistics, genetic markers and wing geometric morphometry), we corroborated the species identity of the sylvatic bugs as T. infestans and found they were indistinguishable from or closely related to local domestic or peridomestic bug populations. Two sylvatic foci were spatially associated to the nearest peridomestic bug populations found before interventions. Sylvatic habitats harbor hidden foci of T. infestans that may represent a threat to vector suppression attempts.

"Brucellosis is endemic in the bovine population in India and causes a loss of US$ 3·4 billion to the livestock industry besides having a significant human health impact.
We developed a stochastic simulation model to estimate the impact of three alternative vaccination strategies on the prevalence of Brucella infection in the bovine populations in India for the next two decades: (a) annual mass vaccination only for the replacement calves and (b) vaccination of both the adult and young population at the beginning of the program followed by an annual vaccination of the replacement calves and, (c) annual mass vaccination of replacements for a decade followed by a decade of a test and slaughter strategy.
For all interventions, our results indicate that the prevalence of Brucella infection will drop below 2% in cattle and, below 3% in buffalo after 20 years of the implementation of a disease control program. For cattle, the Net Present Value (NPV) was found to be US $ 4·16 billion for intervention (a), US $ 8·31 billion for intervention (b) and, US $ 4·26 for intervention (c). For buffalo, the corresponding NPVs were US $ 8·77 billion, US $ 13·42 and, US $ 7·66, respectively. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) for the first, second and the third intervention for cattle were 7·98, 10·62 and, 3·16, respectively. Corresponding BCR estimates for buffalo were 17·81, 21·27 and, 3·79, respectively.
These results suggest that all interventions will be cost-effective with the intervention (b), i.e. the vaccination of replacements with mass vaccination at the beginning of the program, being the most cost-effective choice. Further, sensitivity analysis revealed that all interventions will be cost-effective even at the 50% of the current prevalence estimates. The results advocate for the implementation of a disease control program for brucellosis in India.
","Brucellosis is an endemic zoonosis in India and recent studies demonstrate that the disease results in a median loss of US$ 3.43 billion in livestock populations. Lack of resources to compensate farmers and a ban on cow slaughter means that test and slaughter policy to control brucellosis cannot be implemented in India. This is the first systematic analysis of a brucellosis control program interventions for bovine brucellosis in India. The cost-benefit analysis was successfully conducted and indicated benefits of implementing the intervention policies. For each intervention, our results indicate that the prevalence of Brucella infection will drop below 2% in cattle after 20 years of the implementation of disease control program although some strategies were better than others. The expected net present value (NPV) was found to range from US $ 4·16 to $ 8·31 billion for cattle and from $ 7·66 to $ 13·42 billion in buffalo for the three strategies investigated. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) ranged from 3·16 to 10·62 for cattle and from 3·79 to 21·27 for buffalo. The results advocate for the implementation of a disease control program and will help development of an official health policy for the control of brucellosis in India.

"Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in S. cerevisiae, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all S. cerevisiae translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all S. cerevisiae mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the S. cerevisiae genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.
","Each cell contains a limited number of macromolecules and factors that participate in the gene expression process. These expression resources are shared between the different molecules that encode the genetic code, resulting in non-trivial couplings and competitions between the different gene expression stages. Such competitions should be considered when analyzing the cellular economy of the cell, the genome evolution, and the design of synthetic expression circuits. Here we study the effect of couplings and competitions for ribosomes by performing a whole-cell simulation of translation of S. cerevisiae, with parameters estimated from experimental data. We demonstrate that by periodically changing the mRNA levels of a single gene (endogenous or heterologous) or a set of genes, the translation of all S. cerevisiae genes are affected in a periodic manner. We numerically estimate the exact impact of the mRNA levels periodicity on the translation process dynamics, as well as on the dynamics of the free ribosomal pool and the way it is affected by parameters such as the codon composition of the oscillating gene, its initiation rate and mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that the codon compositions of synthetically highly expressed heterologous genes that are expected to oscillate must be carefully considered. For example, synonymous mutations resulting in “traffic jams” of ribosomes along the fluctuated mRNAs may cause significant fluctuations of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of all genes.

"Meiotic recombination is initiated by large numbers of developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), ranging from dozens to hundreds per cell depending on the organism. DSBs formed in single-copy sequences provoke recombination between allelic positions on homologous chromosomes, but DSBs can also form in and near repetitive elements such as retrotransposons. When they do, they create a risk for deleterious genome rearrangements in the germ line via recombination between non-allelic repeats. A prior study in budding yeast demonstrated that insertion of a Ty retrotransposon into a DSB hotspot can suppress meiotic break formation, but properties of Ty elements in their most common physiological contexts have not been addressed. Here we compile a comprehensive, high resolution map of all Ty elements in the rapidly and efficiently sporulating S. cerevisiae strain SK1 and examine DSB formation in and near these endogenous retrotransposable elements. SK1 has 30 Tys, all but one distinct from the 50 Tys in S288C, the source strain for the yeast reference genome. From whole-genome DSB maps and direct molecular assays, we find that DSB levels and chromatin structure within and near Tys vary widely between different elements and that local DSB suppression is not a universal feature of Ty presence. Surprisingly, deletion of two Ty elements weakened adjacent DSB hotspots, revealing that at least some Ty insertions promote rather than suppress nearby DSB formation. Given high strain-to-strain variability in Ty location and the high aggregate burden of Ty-proximal DSBs, we propose that meiotic recombination is an important component of host-Ty interactions and that Tys play critical roles in genome instability and evolution in both inbred and outcrossed sexual cycles.
","Meiosis is the cell division that generates gametes for sexual reproduction. During meiosis, homologous recombination occurs frequently, initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) made by Spo11. Meiotic recombination usually occurs between sequences at allelic positions on homologous chromosomes, but a DSB within a repetitive element (e.g., a retrotransposon) can provoke recombination between non-allelic sequences instead. This can create genomic havoc in the form of gross chromosomal rearrangements, which underlie many recurrent human mutations. It has been thought that cells minimize this risk by disfavoring DSB formation in repetitive elements, partly based on studies showing that presence of a Ty element (a yeast retrotransposon) can suppress nearby DSB activity. Whether this is a general feature of Tys has not been evaluated, however. Here, we generated a comprehensive map of Tys in the rapidly sporulating SK1 strain and examined DSB formation in and around all of these endogenous Ty elements. Remarkably, most natural Ty elements do not appear to suppress DSB formation nearby, and at least some of them increase local DSBs. These findings have implications for understanding the relationship between host and transposon, and for understanding the impact of retrotransposons on genome stability and evolution during sexual reproduction.

"ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a new method for genomewide mapping of protein binding sites on DNA. It has generated much excitement in functional genomics. To score data and determine adequate sequencing depth, both the genomic background and the binding sites must be properly modeled. To develop a computational foundation to tackle these issues, we first performed a study to characterize the observed statistical nature of this new type of high-throughput data. By linking sequence tags into clusters, we show that there are two components to the distribution of tag counts observed in a number of recent experiments: an initial power-law distribution and a subsequent long right tail. Then we develop in silico ChIP-seq, a computational method to simulate the experimental outcome by placing tags onto the genome according to particular assumed distributions for the actual binding sites and for the background genomic sequence. In contrast to current assumptions, our results show that both the background and the binding sites need to have a markedly nonuniform distribution in order to correctly model the observed ChIP-seq data, with, for instance, the background tag counts modeled by a gamma distribution. On the basis of these results, we extend an existing scoring approach by using a more realistic genomic-background model. This enables us to identify transcription-factor binding sites in ChIP-seq data in a statistically rigorous fashion.
","ChIP-seq is an apt combination of chromosome immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing to identify transcription factor binding sites in vivo on the whole-genome scale. Since its advent, this new method has generated much excitement in the field of functional genomics. Proper computational modeling of the ChIP-seq process is needed for both data scoring and determination of adequate sequencing depth, as it provides the computational foundation for analyzing ChIP-seq data. In our study, we show the characteristics of ChIP-seq data and present in silico ChIP sequencing, a computational method to simulate the experimental outcome. On the basis of our data characterization, we observed transcription factor binding sites with excessive enrichment of sequence tags. Our simulation results reveal that both the genomic background and the binding sites are not uniform. On the basis of our simulation results, we propose a statistical procedure using the more realistic genomic background model to identify binding sites in ChIP-seq data.

"In somatic cells, recombination between the homologous chromosomes followed by equational segregation leads to loss of heterozygosity events (LOH), allowing the expression of recessive alleles and the production of novel allele combinations that are potentially beneficial upon Darwinian selection. However, inter-homolog recombination in somatic cells is rare, thus reducing potential genetic variation. Here, we explored the property of S. cerevisiae to enter the meiotic developmental program, induce meiotic Spo11-dependent double-strand breaks genome-wide and return to mitotic growth, a process known as Return To Growth (RTG). Whole genome sequencing of 36 RTG strains derived from the hybrid S288c/SK1 diploid strain demonstrates that the RTGs are bona fide diploids with mosaic recombined genome, derived from either parental origin. Individual RTG genome-wide genotypes are comprised of 5 to 87 homozygous regions due to the loss of heterozygous (LOH) events of various lengths, varying between a few nucleotides up to several hundred kilobases. Furthermore, we show that reiteration of the RTG process shows incremental increases of homozygosity. Phenotype/genotype analysis of the RTG strains for the auxotrophic and arsenate resistance traits validates the potential of this procedure of genome diversification to rapidly map complex traits loci (QTLs) in diploid strains without undergoing sexual reproduction.
","The genetic diversity of eukaryotes relies on the diversification of the parental information, mostly occurring by recombination during gamete formation. Homologous chromosomes also recombine in somatic cells, though much less frequently. Here, we sequenced the genome of S. cerevisiae hybrid diploid cells that enter the processes of meiosis and Return To mitotic Growth (RTG). Remarkably, the RTG cells contain recombined diploid genomes derived from both parental origins. Each RTG cell is diversely recombined both in terms of the frequency and location, with important implications in genome evolution of the species. The generation of a diversely recombined diploid cell population has useful downstream genetic applications.

"Mycolactone is a macrolide produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, with cytotoxic, analgesic and immunomodulatory properties. The latter were recently shown to result from mycolactone blocking the Sec61-dependent production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells. Here we investigated whether mycolactone similarly affects the inflammatory responses of the nervous cell subsets involved in pain perception, transmission and maintenance. We also investigated the effects of mycolactone on the neuroinflammation that is associated with chronic pain in vivo.
Sensory neurons, Schwann cells and microglia were isolated from mice for ex vivo assessment of mycolactone cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory activity by measuring the production of proalgesic cytokines and chemokines. In all cell types studied, prolonged (>48h) exposure to mycolactone induced significant cell death at concentrations >10 ng/ml. Within the first 24h treatment, nanomolar concentrations of mycolactone efficiently suppressed the cell production of pro-inflammatory mediators, without affecting their viability. Notably, mycolactone also prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia. Since these cells critically contribute to neuroinflammation, we next tested if mycolactone impacts this pathogenic process in vivo. We used a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve. Here, mycolactone was injected daily for 3 days in the spinal canal, to ensure its proper delivery to spinal cord. While this treatment failed to prevent injury-induced neuroinflammation, it decreased significantly the local production of inflammatory cytokines without inducing detectable cytotoxicity.
The present study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence that mycolactone suppresses the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells and microglia, without affecting the cell viability. Together with previous studies using peripheral blood leukocytes, our work implies that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may, at least partially, be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties.
","Mycolactone is a complex macrolidic polyketide produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, with cytotoxic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Peripheral nerve destruction and activation of type 2 angiotensin II receptors on sensory neurons have been proposed to mediate bacteria-induced hypoesthesia in infected skin. In addition, mycolactone was recently shown to block the co-translational translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum in host cells, leading to defective inflammatory responses. Here we examined if this last mechanism may also contribute to inhibit neuro-inflammation and particularly in the context of neuropathic pain. Using a representative panel of primary cells from the central and peripheral nervous systems, we found that indeed, mycolactone potently inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Notably, mycolactone prevented the polarization and pro-inflammatory functions of cortical microglia, which are critical inducers of neuroinflammation. Consistent with our in vitro findings, mycolactone had potent anti-inflammatory effects on the spinal cord of rats injected in the spinal canal, with no apparent side effects. Our data show that mycolactone suppresses inflammatory responses in the nervous system similarly as in the immune system, suggesting that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may, at least partially, be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties.

"Wolbachia are required for filarial nematode survival and fertility and contribute to the immune responses associated with human filarial diseases. Here we developed whole-mount immunofluorescence techniques to characterize Wolbachia somatic and germline transmission patterns and tissue distribution in Brugia malayi, a nematode responsible for lymphatic filariasis. In the initial embryonic divisions, Wolbachia segregate asymmetrically such that they occupy only a small subset of cells in the developing embryo, facilitating their concentration in the adult hypodermal chords and female germline. Wolbachia are not found in male reproductive tissues and the absence of Wolbachia from embryonic germline precursors in half of the embryos indicates Wolbachia loss from the male germline may occur in early embryogenesis. Wolbachia rely on fusion of hypodermal cells to populate adult chords. Finally, we detect Wolbachia in the secretory canal lumen suggesting living worms may release bacteria and/or their products into their host.
","Filarial diseases affect over 150 million people in tropical countries. They are caused by parasitic nematodes like Brugia malayi that rely on their endosymbiont Wolbachia for their survival and fertility. These bacteria are a recognized drug target in the search for treatments killing adult worms. To understand the transmission of Wolbachia from the embryonic to adult stages, we developed new techniques to track these bacteria at the cellular and tissue levels. These techniques include immunofluorescence in whole mount adult tissues and embryos. We found that Wolbachia segregate asymetrically in specific cells, in a lineage-specific manner during early Brugia embryogenesis, and rely on cell fusion to subsequently populate the adult hypodermal chords. From the chords, the Wolbachia can be secreted in the secretory-excretory canal, suggesting that in addition to dead worms releasing the bacteria in the human body, living worms may also secrete Wolbachia, whose role in stimulating the immune system in filarial pathologies is now well established.

"The interactions between membrane receptors and extracellular ligands control cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, and environmental responsiveness by representing the initial steps of cell signaling pathways. These interactions can be spatial-temporally regulated when different extracellular ligands are tethered. The detailed mechanisms of this spatial-temporal regulation, including the competition between distinct ligands with overlapping binding sites and the conformational flexibility in multi-specific ligand assemblies have not been quantitatively evaluated. We present a new coarse-grained model to realistically simulate the binding process between multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors on cell surfaces. The model simplifies each receptor and each binding site in a multi-specific ligand as a rigid body. Different numbers or types of ligands are spatially organized together in the simulation. These designs were used to test the relation between the overall binding of a multi-specific ligand and the affinity of its cognate binding site. When a variety of ligands are exposed to cells expressing different densities of surface receptors, we demonstrated that ligands with reduced affinities have higher specificity to distinguish cells based on the relative concentrations of their receptors. Finally, modification of intramolecular flexibility was shown to play a role in optimizing the binding between receptors and ligands. In summary, our studies bring new insights to the general principles of ligand-receptor interactions. Future applications of our method will pave the way for new strategies to generate next-generation biologics.
","In order to adapt to surrounding environments, multiple signaling pathways have been evolved in cells. The first step of these pathways is to detect external stimuli, which is conducted by the dynamic interactions between cell surface receptors and extracellular ligands. As a result, recognition of extracellular ligands by cell surface receptors is an indispensable component of many physiological or pathological activities. In both natural selection and drug design, the presence of multiple binding sites in extracellular ligand complexes (so-called multi-specific ligands) is a common strategy to target different receptors on surface of the same cell. Such spatial organization of ligand binding sites can elaborately modulate the downstream signaling pathways. However, our understanding to the interactions between multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors is largely limited by the fact that these interactions are difficult to quantify and they have only been successfully measured in a very small number of cases in vivo. Using a simple computational model, we can realistically simulate the binding process between specially designed multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors on cell surfaces. This study therefore provides a useful pathway to unravel basic mechanisms of ligand-receptor interactions and design principles for new drug candidates.

"West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are mosquito-borne viral infections. Over the past few decades, WNV has been associated with several outbreaks involving high numbers of neuroinvasive diseases among humans. The recent re-emergence of ZIKV has been associated with congenital malformation and also with Guillain–Barre syndrome in adults. The geographic range of arthropod-borne viruses has been rapidly increasing in recent years. The objectives of this study were to determine the presence of IgG specific antibodies and the genome of WNV and ZIKV in human samples, as well as WNV and ZIKV genomes in wild-caught mosquitoes in urban and rural areas of the Hormozgan province, in southern Iran. A total of 494 serum samples were tested for the presence of WNV and ZIKV IgG antibodies using ELISA assays. One hundred and two (20.6%) samples were reactive for WNV IgG antibodies. All serum samples were negative for ZIKV IgG antibodies. Using the multivariable logistic analysis, age (45+ vs. 1–25; OR = 3.4, 95% C.I.: 1.8–6.3), occupation (mostly outdoor vs. mostly indoor; OR = 2.4, 95% C.I.: 1.1–5.2), and skin type(type I/II vs. type III/IV and type V/VI; OR = 4.3, 95% C.I.: 1.7–10.8 and OR = 2.7, 95% C.I.: 1.3–5.5 respectively, skin types based on Fitzpatrick scale) showed significant association with WNV seroreactivity. We collected 2,015 mosquitoes in 136 pools belonging to 5 genera and 14 species. Three pools of Culex pipiens complex were positive for WNV RNA using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR). ZIKV RNA was not detected in any of the pools. All WNV ELISA reactive serum samples were negative for WNV RNA. In conclusion, we provided evidence of the establishment of WNV in southern Iran and no proof of ZIKV in serum samples or in mosquito vectors. The establishment of an organized arbovirus surveillance system and active case finding strategies seems to be necessary.
","In recent decades mosquito-borne viruses have reached and adapted to new habitats, and now they can be found in nearly all continents. Facilitated goods transportation, live stock exchange, people travelling more easily, and most importantly world climate alterations, might be some of the reasons for this mosquito habitat spreading. Emergence of WNV in North America, Europe, and most Mediterranean countries like Turkey, Greece and Israel is evidence of this spreading. Furthermore, emergence and re-emergence of some of these mosquito borne viruses in new areas may be accompanied with changes in their pre-known pathogenesis. Re-emergence of ZIKV in the South Pacific and America from 2007 to 2016 was accompanied with an increase in neurovirulent diseases and congenital malformations. In this study, we evaluated the presence of WNV and ZIKV via serological and genome detection in human samples and mosquitoes (viral genome analysis) from southern Iran. This region is on the coast with a warm and tropical climate suitable for inhabitation and expansion of the vectors harboring these two viruses. We caught a large spectrum of mosquitoes from these areas. After classification, we analyzed the mosquitoes’ pools for WNV and ZIKV genomic RNA. Our results showed that 20.6% of the studied human samples were IgG reactive to WNV while no antibodies against ZIKV were detected. We found WNV RNA genome in three mosquitoes’ pools. The genomic analysis was negative for ZIKV in both human and mosquito samples. Based on the results WNV is notably circulating in southern Iran; while no evidence of ZIKV infection in people or circulation in any of the vectors was observed.

"Identification of blood sources of hematophagous arthropods is crucial for understanding the transmission cycles of vector-borne diseases. Many different approaches towards host determination were proposed, including precipitin test, ELISA, DNA- and mass spectrometry-based methods; yet all face certain complications and limitations, mostly related to blood degradation. This study presents a novel method for blood meal identification, peptide mass mapping (PMM) analysis of host-specific hemoglobin peptides using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
To identify blood meal source, proteins from abdomens of engorged sand fly females were extracted, cleaved by trypsin and peptide fragments of host hemoglobin were sequenced using MALDI-TOF MS. The method provided correct host identification of 100% experimentally fed sand flies until 36h post blood meal (PBM) and for 80% samples even 48h PBM. In females fed on two hosts, both blood meal sources were correctly assigned for 60% of specimens until 36h PBM. In a validation study on field-collected females, the method yielded unambiguous host determination for 96% of specimens. The suitability of PMM-based MALDI-TOF MS was proven experimentally also on lab-reared Culex mosquitoes.
PMM-based MALDI-TOF MS analysis targeting host specific hemoglobin peptides represents a sensitive and cost-effective method with a fast and simple preparation protocol. As demonstrated here on phlebotomine sand flies and mosquitoes, it allows reliable and rapid blood source determination even 48h PBM with minimal material input and provides more robust and specific results than other currently used methods. This approach was also successfully tested on field-caught engorged females and proved to be a promising useful tool for large-scale screening of host preferences studies. Unlike other methods including MALDI-TOF protein profiling, it allows correct identification of mixed blood meals as was demonstrated on both experimentally fed and field-collected sand flies.
","Leishmaniases belong among the most important and yet neglected vector-borne diseases, transmitted mostly by bite of female phlebotomine sand flies. To understand role of different reservoir hosts in the transmission cycles, it is important to determine blood meal sources of bloodfeeding females. Most of currently used methods face challenges due to tiny volumes of engorged blood, in case of mammals also enucleated, as well as quick progress of blood digestion which leads to rapid DNA and protein degradation. New approach towards blood source determination presented in this study is based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry that identifies unique peptide sequences of host hemoglobins, showing high precision and sensitivity together with a longer time period for successful host determination when compared to nowadays standardly used DNA sequencing. It was tested and verified on engorged phlebotomine sand flies from both laboratory colonies and natural endemic areas and also on Culex mosquitoes and shall be universal to hematophagous insects. Beside blood meal identification, it allows also the use of both morphological and molecular methods (DNA- or protein-based) for the species identification of the analysed specimen.

"Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are ion channels that regulate muscle contraction by releasing calcium ions from intracellular stores into the cytoplasm. Mutations in skeletal muscle RyR (RyR1) give rise to congenital diseases such as central core disease. The absence of high-resolution structures of RyR1 has limited our understanding of channel function and disease mechanisms at the molecular level. Here, we report a structural model of the pore-forming region of RyR1. Molecular dynamics simulations show high ion binding to putative pore residues D4899, E4900, D4938, and D4945, which are experimentally known to be critical for channel conductance and selectivity. We also observe preferential localization of Ca2+ over K+ in the selectivity filter of RyR1. Simulations of RyR1-D4899Q mutant show a loss of preference to Ca2+ in the selectivity filter as seen experimentally. Electrophysiological experiments on a central core disease mutant, RyR1-G4898R, show constitutively open channels that conduct K+ but not Ca2+. Our simulations with G4898R likewise show a decrease in the preference of Ca2+ over K+ in the selectivity filter. Together, the computational and experimental results shed light on ion conductance and selectivity of RyR1 at an atomistic level.
","Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are ion channels present in the membranes of an intracellular calcium storage organelle, the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Nerve impulse triggers the opening of RyR channels, thus increasing the cytoplasmic calcium levels, which subsequently leads to muscle contraction. Congenital mutations in a specific type of RyR that is present in skeletal muscles, RyR1, lead to central core disease (CCD), which leads to weakened muscle. RyR1 mutations also render patients to be highly susceptible to malignant hyperthermia, an adverse reaction to general anesthesia. Although it is generally known that CCD mutations abort RyR1 function, the molecular basis of RyR1 dysfunction remains largely unknown because of the lack of atomic-level structure. Here, we present a structural model of the RyR1 pore region, where many of the CCD mutations are located. Molecular dynamics simulations of the pore region confirm the positions of residues experimentally known to be relevant for function. Furthermore, electrophysiological experiments and simulations shed light on the loss of function of CCD mutant channels. The combined theoretical and experimental studies on RyR1 elucidate the ion conduction pathway of RyR1 and a potential molecular origin of muscle diseases.

"Genetic variation and rapid evolution are hallmarks of RNA viruses, the result of high mutation rates in RNA replication and selection of mutants that enhance viral adaptation, including the escape from host immune responses. Variability is uneven across the genome because mutations resulting in a deleterious effect on viral fitness are restricted. RNA viruses are thus marked by protein sites permissive to multiple mutations and sites critical to viral structure-function that are evolutionarily robust and highly conserved. Identification and characterization of the historical dynamics of the conserved sites have relevance to multiple applications, including potential targets for diagnosis, and prophylactic and therapeutic purposes.
We describe a large-scale identification and analysis of evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid sequences of the entire dengue virus (DENV) proteome, with a focus on sequences of 9 amino acids or more, and thus immune-relevant as potential T-cell determinants. DENV protein sequence data were collected from the NCBI Entrez protein database in 2005 (9,512 sequences) and again in 2007 (12,404 sequences). Forty-four (44) sequences (pan-DENV sequences), mainly those of nonstructural proteins and representing ∼15% of the DENV polyprotein length, were identical in 80% or more of all recorded DENV sequences. Of these 44 sequences, 34 (∼77%) were present in ≥95% of sequences of each DENV type, and 27 (∼61%) were conserved in other Flaviviruses. The frequencies of variants of the pan-DENV sequences were low (0 to ∼5%), as compared to variant frequencies of ∼60 to ∼85% in the non pan-DENV sequence regions. We further showed that the majority of the conserved sequences were immunologically relevant: 34 contained numerous predicted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertype-restricted peptide sequences, and 26 contained T-cell determinants identified by studies with HLA-transgenic mice and/or reported to be immunogenic in humans.
Forty-four (44) pan-DENV sequences of at least 9 amino acids were highly conserved and identical in 80% or more of all recorded DENV sequences, and the majority were found to be immune-relevant by their correspondence to known or putative HLA-restricted T-cell determinants. The conservation of these sequences through the entire recorded DENV genetic history supports their possible value for diagnosis, prophylactic and/or therapeutic applications. The combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches applied herein provides a framework for large-scale and systematic analysis of conserved and variable sequences of other pathogens, in particular, for rapidly mutating viruses, such as influenza A virus and HIV.
","Dengue viruses (DENVs) circulate in nature as a population of 4 distinct types, each with multiple genotypes and variants, and represent an increasing global public health issue with no prophylactic and therapeutic formulations currently available. Viral genomes contain sites that are evolutionarily stable and therefore highly conserved, presumably because changes in these sites have deleterious effects on viral fitness and survival. The identification and characterization of the historical dynamics of these sites in DENV have relevance to several applications such as diagnosis and drug and vaccine development. In this study, we have identified sequence fragments that were conserved across the majority of available DENV sequences, analyzed their historical dynamics, and evaluated their relevance as candidate vaccine targets, using various bioinformatics-based methods and immune assay in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) transgenic mice. This approach provides a framework for large-scale and systematic analysis of other human pathogens.

"Drug addiction is a serious worldwide problem with strong genetic and environmental influences. Different technologies have revealed a variety of genes and pathways underlying addiction; however, each individual technology can be biased and incomplete. We integrated 2,343 items of evidence from peer-reviewed publications between 1976 and 2006 linking genes and chromosome regions to addiction by single-gene strategies, microrray, proteomics, or genetic studies. We identified 1,500 human addiction-related genes and developed KARG (http://karg.cbi.pku.edu.cn), the first molecular database for addiction-related genes with extensive annotations and a friendly Web interface. We then performed a meta-analysis of 396 genes that were supported by two or more independent items of evidence to identify 18 molecular pathways that were statistically significantly enriched, covering both upstream signaling events and downstream effects. Five molecular pathways significantly enriched for all four different types of addictive drugs were identified as common pathways which may underlie shared rewarding and addictive actions, including two new ones, GnRH signaling pathway and gap junction. We connected the common pathways into a hypothetical common molecular network for addiction. We observed that fast and slow positive feedback loops were interlinked through CAMKII, which may provide clues to explain some of the irreversible features of addiction.
","Drug addiction has become one of the most serious problems in the world. It has been estimated that genetic factors contribute to 40%–60% of the vulnerability to drug addiction, and environmental factors provide the remainder. What are the genes and pathways underlying addiction? Is there a common molecular network underlying addiction to different abusive substances? Is there any network property that may explain the long-lived and often irreversible molecular and structural changes after addiction? These important questions were traditionally studied experimentally. The explosion of genomic and proteomic data in recent years both enabled and necessitated bioinformatic studies of addiction. We integrated data derived from multiple technology platforms and collected 2,343 items of evidence linking genes and chromosome regions to addiction. We identified 18 statistically significantly enriched molecular pathways. In particular, five of them were common for four types of addictive drugs, which may underlie shared rewarding and addictive actions, including two new ones, GnRH signaling pathway and gap junction. We connected the common pathways into a hypothetical common molecular network for addiction. We observed that fast and slow positive feedback loops were interlinked through CAMKII, which may provide clues to explain some of the irreversible features of addiction.

"Eumycetoma is a traumatic fungal infection in tropical and subtropical areas that may lead to severe disability. Madurella mycetomatis is one of the prevalent etiologic agents in arid Northeastern Africa. The source of infection has not been clarified. Subcutaneous inoculation from plant thorns has been hypothesized, but attempts to detect the fungus in relevant material have remained unsuccessful. The present study aims to find clues to reveal the natural habitat of Madurella species using a phylogenetic approach, i.e. by comparison of neighboring taxa with known ecology. Four species of Madurella were included in a large data set of species of Chaetomium, Chaetomidium, Thielavia, and Papulaspora (n = 128) using sequences of the universal fungal barcode gene rDNA ITS and the partial LSU gene sequence. Our study demonstrates that Madurella species are nested within the Chaetomiaceae, a family of fungi that mainly inhabit animal dung, enriched soil, and indoor environments. We hypothesize that cattle dung, ubiquitously present in rural East Africa, plays a significant role in the ecology of Madurella. If cow dung is an essential factor in inoculation by Madurella, preventative measures may involve the use of appropriate footwear in addition to restructuring of villages to reduce the frequency of contact with etiologic agents of mycetoma. On the other hand, the Chaetomiaceae possess a hidden clinical potential which needs to be explored.
","Eumycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis is a common subcutaneous, mutilating fungal infection endemic in arid climate zones. Still there are many controversies on the route of infection, but traumatic inoculation of the subcutaneous tissue with the thorn or soil causative organism through minor skin trauma is a popular theory. This is due to the fact that, the origin and natural habitat of Madurella species, the prevalent mycetoma agents are still unknown. In order to predict the natural habitat of M. mycetomatis we investigated its phylogenetic relationships to species with known ecology. Two genes phylogeny based on LSU and ITS was performed for the species of the genus Madurella and representative genera from the family of Chaetomiaceae. Our findings confirmed that Madurella species are phylogenetically member of the family Chaetomiaceae. Members of this family are often found in dung and manure-enriched soil. We therefore suggest that animal dung, abundantly present in endemic villages, could be a possible niche for Madurella and plays an essential role in the onset of eumycetoma. This will help in understanding the origin of the disease and could be a base for future in depth study to investigate the presence of Madurella in dung from endemic areas.

"Exome sequencing studies in complex diseases are challenged by the allelic heterogeneity, large number and modest effect sizes of associated variants on disease risk and the presence of large numbers of neutral variants, even in phenotypically relevant genes. Isolated populations with recent bottlenecks offer advantages for studying rare variants in complex diseases as they have deleterious variants that are present at higher frequencies as well as a substantial reduction in rare neutral variation. To explore the potential of the Finnish founder population for studying low-frequency (0.5–5%) variants in complex diseases, we compared exome sequence data on 3,000 Finns to the same number of non-Finnish Europeans and discovered that, despite having fewer variable sites overall, the average Finn has more low-frequency loss-of-function variants and complete gene knockouts. We then used several well-characterized Finnish population cohorts to study the phenotypic effects of 83 enriched loss-of-function variants across 60 phenotypes in 36,262 Finns. Using a deep set of quantitative traits collected on these cohorts, we show 5 associations (p<5×10−8) including splice variants in LPA that lowered plasma lipoprotein(a) levels (P = 1.5×10−117). Through accessing the national medical records of these participants, we evaluate the LPA finding via Mendelian randomization and confirm that these splice variants confer protection from cardiovascular disease (OR = 0.84, P = 3×10−4), demonstrating for the first time the correlation between very low levels of LPA in humans with potential therapeutic implications for cardiovascular diseases. More generally, this study articulates substantial advantages for studying the role of rare variation in complex phenotypes in founder populations like the Finns and by combining a unique population genetic history with data from large population cohorts and centralized research access to National Health Registers.
","We explored the coding regions of 3,000 Finnish individuals with 3,000 non-Finnish Europeans (NFEs) using whole-exome sequence data, in order to understand how an individual from a bottlenecked population might differ from an individual from an out-bred population. We provide empirical evidence that there are more rare and low-frequency deleterious alleles in Finns compared to NFEs, such that an average Finn has almost twice as many low-frequency complete knockouts of a gene. As such, we hypothesized that some of these low-frequency loss-of-function variants might have important medical consequences in humans and genotyped 83 of these variants in 36,000 Finns. In doing so, we discovered that completely knocking out the TSFM gene might result in inviability or a very severe phenotype in humans and that knocking out the LPA gene might confer protection against coronary heart diseases, suggesting that LPA is likely to be a good potential therapeutic target.

"Most filarial parasite species contain Wolbachia, obligatory bacterial endosymbionts that are crucial for filarial development and reproduction. They are targets for alternative chemotherapy, but their role in the biology of filarial nematodes is not well understood. Light microscopy provides important information on morphology, localization and potential function of these bacteria. Surprisingly, immunohistology and in situ hybridization techniques have not been widely used to monitor Wolbachia distribution during the filarial life cycle.
A monoclonal antibody directed against Wolbachia surface protein and in situ hybridization targeting Wolbachia 16S rRNA were used to monitor Wolbachia during the life cycle of B. malayi. In microfilariae and vector stage larvae only a few cells contain Wolbachia. In contrast, large numbers of Wolbachia were detected in the lateral chords of L4 larvae, but no endobacteria were detected in the genital primordium. In young adult worms (5 weeks p.i.), a massive expansion of Wolbachia was observed in the lateral chords adjacent to ovaries or testis, but no endobacteria were detected in the growth zone of the ovaries, uterus, the growth zone of the testis or the vas deferens. Confocal laser scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that numerous Wolbachia are aligned towards the developing ovaries and single endobacteria were detected in the germline. In inseminated females (8 weeks p.i.) Wolbachia were observed in the ovaries, embryos and in decreasing numbers in the lateral chords. In young males Wolbachia were found in distinct zones of the testis and in large numbers in the lateral chords in the vicinity of testicular tissue but never in mature spermatids or spermatozoa.
Immunohistology and in situ hybridization show distinct tissue and stage specific distribution patterns for Wolbachia in B. malayi. Extensive multiplication of Wolbachia occurs in the lateral chords of L4 and young adults adjacent to germline cells.

The process of overcoming tissue boundaries to ensure transovarial transmission of Wolbachia could be an Achilles heel in the life cycle of B. malayi.

"Chlamydia trachomatis remains one of the few major human pathogens for which there is no transformation system. C. trachomatis has a unique obligate intracellular developmental cycle. The extracellular infectious elementary body (EB) is an infectious, electron-dense structure that, following host cell infection, differentiates into a non-infectious replicative form known as a reticulate body (RB). Host cells infected by C. trachomatis that are treated with penicillin are not lysed because this antibiotic prevents the maturation of RBs into EBs. Instead the RBs fail to divide although DNA replication continues. We have exploited these observations to develop a transformation protocol based on expression of β-lactamase that utilizes rescue from the penicillin-induced phenotype. We constructed a vector which carries both the chlamydial endogenous plasmid and an E.coli plasmid origin of replication so that it can shuttle between these two bacterial recipients. The vector, when introduced into C. trachomatis L2 under selection conditions, cures the endogenous chlamydial plasmid. We have shown that foreign promoters operate in vivo in C. trachomatis and that active β-lactamase and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase are expressed. To demonstrate the technology we have isolated chlamydial transformants that express the green fluorescent protein (GFP). As proof of principle, we have shown that manipulation of chlamydial biochemistry is possible by transformation of a plasmid-free C. trachomatis recipient strain. The acquisition of the plasmid restores the ability of the plasmid-free C. trachomatis to synthesise and accumulate glycogen within inclusions. These findings pave the way for a comprehensive genetic study on chlamydial gene function that has hitherto not been possible. Application of this technology avoids the use of therapeutic antibiotics and therefore the procedures do not require high level containment and will allow the analysis of genome function by complementation.
","C. trachomatis is a major human pathogen for which there is no means of genetically manipulating its DNA. It is an obligate intracellular bacterium which has a complex developmental cycle that takes place in a specialized host cell cytoplasmic vacuole known as an inclusion. We have constructed a shuttle vector based on the chlamydial plasmid and developed a new approach to select genetically modified bacteria. It uses rescue by selection of stable infectious, penicillin-resistant C. trachomatis from a pool of non-dividing, non-infectious C. trachomatis (induced by penicillin arrest of the developmental cycle). The transformed C. trachomatis is also cured of its endogenous plasmid by the selection of the transforming vector. The vector was modified to express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in both Chlamydia and E. coli. We have genetically manipulated a plasmid-free recipient strain of C. trachomatis and shown restoration of the ability of this recipient strain to synthesize and accumulate glycogen within inclusions upon acquisition of the shuttle vector. The ability to transform and manipulate C. trachomatis using a complementation based vector is an important advance that opens up the field of Chlamydia research.

"Snakebite antivenom is a 120 years old invention based on polyclonal mixtures of antibodies purified from the blood of hyper-immunized animals. Knowledge on antibody recognition sites (epitopes) on snake venom proteins is limited, but may be used to provide molecular level explanations for antivenom cross-reactivity. In turn, this may help guide antivenom development by elucidating immunological biases in existing antivenoms. In this study, we have identified and characterized linear elements of B-cell epitopes from 870 pit viper venom protein sequences by employing a high-throughput methodology based on custom designed high-density peptide microarrays. By combining data on antibody-peptide interactions with multiple sequence alignments of homologous toxin sequences and protein modelling, we have determined linear elements of antibody binding sites for snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs), phospholipases A2s (PLA2s), and snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs). The studied antivenom antibodies were found to recognize linear elements in each of the three enzymatic toxin families. In contrast to a similar study of elapid (non-enzymatic) neurotoxins, these enzymatic toxins were generally not recognized at the catalytic active site responsible for toxicity, but instead at other sites, of which some are known for allosteric inhibition or for interaction with the tissue target. Antibody recognition was found to be preserved for several minor variations in the protein sequences, although the antibody-toxin interactions could often be eliminated completely by substitution of a single residue. This finding is likely to have large implications for the cross-reactivity of the antivenom and indicate that multiple different antibodies are likely to be needed for targeting an entire group of toxins in these recognized sites.
","Although snakebite antivenom is a 120-year-old invention, saving lives and limbs of thousands of snakebite victims every year, little is known about the mechanisms and molecular interactions of how antivenoms neutralize snake toxins. Antivenoms are produced by immunizing large animals with cocktails of snake venoms resulting in antibodies recognizing toxic as well as non-toxic venom proteins to variable degrees. As a result, high doses of antivenom are needed for treating a snakebite victim, causing more severe adverse reactions due to a high burden of heterologous antivenom proteins. For the first time, we have characterized the antibody recognition sites on hundreds of pit viper toxins using high-throughput peptide microarray technology and an antivenom specific for three pit vipers inflicting a high number of bites in Central America. Most pit viper toxins are enzymes known to have a catalytic site important for toxicity. However, our results suggest that the employed antivenom generally does not target such sites, but instead inhibits toxicity by binding to alternative sites, possibly causing conformational shifts in the toxin structures or interference with toxin-target recognition. The identification of these toxin-specific recognition sites may explain why the antivenom is effective against certain snakebites from pit vipers whose venoms are not part of the immunization mixture.

"Seed germination and subsequent seedling growth define crucial steps for entry into the plant life cycle. For those events to take place properly, seed developmental genes need to be silenced whereas vegetative growth genes are activated. Chromatin structure is generally known to play crucial roles in gene transcription control. However, the transition between active and repressive chromatin states during seed germination is still poorly characterized and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we identified the Arabidopsis PHD-domain H3K4me3-binding ALFIN1-like proteins (ALs) as novel interactors of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) core components AtBMI1b and AtRING1a. The interactions were confirmed by diverse in vitro and in vivo assays and were shown to require the AL6 N-terminus containing PAL domain conserved in the AL family proteins and the AtRING1a C-terminus containing RAWUL domain conserved in animal and plant PRC1 ring-finger proteins (including AtRNIG1a/b and AtBMI1a/b). By T-DNA insertion mutant analysis, we found that simultaneous loss of AL6 and AL7 as well as loss of AtBMI1a and AtBMI1b retards seed germination and causes transcriptional derepression and a delayed chromatin state switch from H3K4me3 to H3K27me3 enrichment of several seed developmental genes (e.g. ABI3, DOG1, CRU3, CHO1). We found that AL6 and the PRC1 H3K27me3-reader component LHP1 directly bind at ABI3 and DOG1 loci. In light of these data, we propose that AL PHD-PRC1 complexes, built around H3K4me3, lead to a switch from the H3K4me3-associated active to the H3K27me3-associated repressive transcription state of seed developmental genes during seed germination. Our finding of physical interactions between PHD-domain proteins and PRC1 is striking and has important implications for understanding the connection between the two functionally opposite chromatin marks: H3K4me3 in activation and H3K27me3 in repression of gene transcription.
","Seed germination is a key developmental transition during the plant life cycle. During this process, seed developmental genes are progressively turned off to allow proper seedling growth and development. Molecular mechanisms involved in establishing the repression state of seed developmental genes, however, are still poorly known.

Our study unravels a striking connection between PHD-domain proteins and PRC1, two types of readers for the functionally opposite chromatin marks. The newly uncovered mechanism is relevant to understand reprogramming of gene activity, which is at the heart of plant growth phase transitions and of cell differentiations in plants and other organisms.

"Recent studies using cell culture infection systems that recapitulate the entire life cycle of hepatitis C virus (HCV) indicate that several nonstructural viral proteins, including NS2, NS3, and NS5A, are involved in the process of viral assembly and release. Other recent work suggests that Ser-168 of NS2 is a target of CK2 kinase–mediated phosphorylation, and that this controls the stability of the genotype 1a NS2 protein. Here, we show that Ser-168 is a critical determinant in the production of infectious virus particles. Substitution of Ser-168 with Ala (or Gly) ablated production of infectious virus by cells transfected with a chimeric viral RNA (HJ3-5) containing core-NS2 sequences from the genotype 1a H77 virus within the background of genotype 2a JFH1 virus. An S168A substitution also impaired production of virus by cells transfected with JFH1 RNA. This mutation did not alter polyprotein processing or genome replication. This defect in virus production could be rescued by expression of wt NS2 in trans from an alphavirus replicon. The trans-complementing activities of NS2 from genotypes 1a and 2a demonstrated strong preferences for rescue of the homologous genotype. Importantly, the S168A mutation did not alter the association of core or NS5A proteins with host cell lipid droplets, nor prevent the assembly of core into particles with sedimentation and buoyant density properties similar to infectious virus, indicating that NS2 acts subsequent to the involvement of core, NS5A, and NS3 in particle assembly. Second-site mutations in NS2 as well as in NS5A can rescue the defect in virus production imposed by the S168G mutation. In aggregate, these results indicate that NS2 functions in trans, in a late-post assembly maturation step, perhaps in concert with NS5A, to confer infectivity to the HCV particle.
","Worldwide, more than 200 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and thus at risk for fatal liver disease. New, virus-specific therapies are under development by the pharmaceutical industry that target aspects of virus entry and genome replication. However, the process of viral assembly and release from the cell remains cloaked in mystery and thus difficult to target for drug development. Here we describe studies that reveal a previously unrecognized role for the nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) of HCV during a late step in this process. We show that mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of NS2 disrupt a maturation step that is required to convert a viral assembly intermediate to a fully infectious virus particle. Additional genetic evidence suggests that this maturation step occurs in concert with another nonstructural protein, NS5A. This study thus sheds new light on the role of nonstructural proteins in assembly and maturation of infectious HCV particles and suggests new targets for drug development.

"Malaria starts with the infection of the liver of the host by Plasmodium sporozoites, the parasite form transmitted by infected mosquitoes. Sporozoites migrate through several hepatocytes by breaching their plasma membranes before finally infecting one with the formation of an internalization vacuole. Migration through host cells induces apical regulated exocytosis in sporozoites. Here we show that apical regulated exocytosis is induced by increases in cAMP in sporozoites of rodent (P. yoelii and P. berghei) and human (P. falciparum) Plasmodium species. We have generated P. berghei parasites deficient in adenylyl cyclase α (ACα), a gene containing regions with high homology to adenylyl cyclases. PbACα-deficient sporozoites do not exocytose in response to migration through host cells and present more than 50% impaired hepatocyte infectivity in vivo. These effects are specific to ACα, as re-introduction of ACα in deficient parasites resulted in complete recovery of exocytosis and infection. Our findings indicate that ACα and increases in cAMP levels are required for sporozoite apical regulated exocytosis, which is involved in sporozoite infection of hepatocytes.
","Malaria is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito that deposits Plasmodium sporozoites under the skin. These sporozoites migrate from the skin into the circulation and then enter the liver to start a new infection inside hepatocytes. Sporozoites have the capacity to traverse mammalian cells. They breach their membranes and migrate through their cytosol. This process is required for infection of the liver and triggers the exposure of adhesive proteins in the apical end of sporozoites, a process that facilitates invasion of hepatocytes. We found that elevations of cAMP inside sporozoites mediate the exposure of adhesive proteins and therefore the infection process. Mutant sporozoites that do not express adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme that synthesizes cAMP, are not able to expose the adhesive proteins and their infectivity is reduced by half. Reinsertion of adenylyl cyclase gene in the mutant sporozoites recovers their capacity to expose adhesive proteins and to infect hepatocytes, confirming the specific role of this protein in infection. These results demonstrate the importance of cAMP and the exposure of adhesive proteins in sporozoites, but also show that Plasmodium sporozoites have other mechanisms to invade host hepatocytes that are not inhibited in the mutant parasites.

"Eukaryotic genomes contain significant amounts of transposons and repetitive DNA elements, which, if transcribed, can be detrimental to the organism. Expression of these elements is suppressed by establishment of repressive chromatin modifications. In Arabidopsis thaliana, they are silenced by the siRNA–mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway where long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) produced by RNA Polymerase V (Pol V) guide ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) to chromatin and attract enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications. It is unknown how chromatin modifying enzymes are recruited to chromatin. We show through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that SPT5L/KTF1, a silencing factor and a homolog of SPT5 elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcriptional silencing. Chromatin binding of SPT5L/KTF1 occurs downstream of RNA Polymerase V, but independently from the presence of 24-nt siRNA. We also show that SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and independently of each other. As shown using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, binding of both AGO4 and SPT5L/KTF1 is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications of several loci. We propose that the coordinate binding of SPT5L and AGO4 creates a platform for direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes.
","Transposons and other repetitive elements occupy vast areas of the eukaryotic genomes. They pose a threat to genome integrity but at the same time regulate expression of many genes and have been proposed to be a major factor contributing to genome evolution. One of the processes responsible for controlling activity of transposons and other repetitive elements is transcriptional gene silencing. This process uses small interfering RNA and long non-coding RNA to recruit enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications. Several proteins have been identified to be needed for siRNA–mediated transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana, however for many of them their position in the silencing pathway is unknown. One of those proteins is SPT5L/KTF1, a homolog of an elongation factor associated with RNA Polymerase II. Here we establish the position of SPT5L in the silencing pathway and propose the molecular mechanism of its function. This gives further knowledge of the mechanism of transcriptional gene silencing and is important to understand how transposons are controlled.

"Dysregulation of iron metabolism in cancer is well documented and it has been suggested that there is interdependence between excess iron and increased cancer incidence and progression. In an effort to better understand the linkages between iron metabolism and breast cancer, a predictive mathematical model of an expanded iron homeostasis pathway was constructed that includes species involved in iron utilization, oxidative stress response and oncogenic pathways. The model leads to three predictions. The first is that overexpression of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) recapitulates many aspects of the alterations in free iron and iron-related proteins in cancer cells without affecting the oxidative stress response or the oncogenic pathways included in the model. This prediction was validated by experimentation. The second prediction is that iron-related proteins are dramatically affected by mitochondrial ferritin overexpression. This prediction was validated by results in the pertinent literature not used for model construction. The third prediction is that oncogenic Ras pathways contribute to altered iron homeostasis in cancer cells. This prediction was validated by a combination of simulation experiments of Ras overexpression and catalase knockout in conjunction with the literature. The model successfully captures key aspects of iron metabolism in breast cancer cells and provides a framework upon which more detailed models can be built.
","Iron is required for cellular metabolism and growth, but can be toxic due to its ability to cause high oxidative stress and consequently DNA damage. To prevent damage, all organisms that require iron have developed mechanisms to tightly control iron levels. Dysregulation of iron metabolism is detrimental and can contribute to a wide range of diseases, including cancer. This paper presents a predictive mathematical model of iron regulation linked to iron utilization, oxidative stress, and the oncogenic response specific to normal breast epithelial cells. The model uses a discrete modeling framework to generate novel biological hypotheses for an investigation of how normal breast cells become malignant cells, capturing a breast cancer phenotype of iron homeostasis through overexpression and knockout simulations. The new biology discovered is (1) IRP2 overexpression alters the iron homeostasis pathway in breast cells, without affecting the oxidative stress response or oncogenic pathways, (2) an activated oncogenic pathway disrupts iron regulation in breast cancer cells.

"Within-population genetic diversity is greatest within Africa, while between-population genetic diversity is directly proportional to geographic distance. The most divergent contemporary human populations include the click-speaking forager peoples of southern Africa, broadly defined as Khoesan. Both intra- (Bantu expansion) and inter-continental migration (European-driven colonization) have resulted in complex patterns of admixture between ancient geographically isolated Khoesan and more recently diverged populations. Using gender-specific analysis and almost 1 million autosomal markers, we determine the significance of estimated ancestral contributions that have shaped five contemporary southern African populations in a cohort of 103 individuals. Limited by lack of available data for homogenous Khoesan representation, we identify the Ju/'hoan (n = 19) as a distinct early diverging human lineage with little to no significant non-Khoesan contribution. In contrast to the Ju/'hoan, we identify ancient signatures of Khoesan and Bantu unions resulting in significant Khoesan- and Bantu-derived contributions to the Southern Bantu amaXhosa (n = 15) and Khoesan !Xun (n = 14), respectively. Our data further suggests that contemporary !Xun represent distinct Khoesan prehistories. Khoesan assimilation with European settlement at the most southern tip of Africa resulted in significant ancestral Khoesan contributions to the Coloured (n = 25) and Baster (n = 30) populations. The latter populations were further impacted by 170 years of East Indian slave trade and intra-continental migrations resulting in a complex pattern of genetic variation (admixture). The populations of southern Africa provide a unique opportunity to investigate the genomic variability from some of the oldest human lineages to the implications of complex admixture patterns including ancient and recently diverged human lineages.
","The Khoesan have received recent attention, as they are the most genetically diverse contemporary human populations. However, Khoesan populations are poorly defined, while archeological evidence suggests a once broader dispersal of click-speaking southern African foragers. Migrations into the regions populated by contemporary Khoesan involved agro-pastoral Bantu around 1,500 years ago, followed over a millennium later by the arrival of European colonists establishing a halfway station for a maritime route between Europe and the East, which led to unions between diverse global populations. Using almost a million genetic markers for 103 individuals, we confirmed a significant Khoesan contribution to five southern African populations. The Ju/'hoan show genetic isolation (early divergence from all other modern humans), carry no significant non-Khoesan contributions, and unlike most global populations lack signatures of gene-based adaption to agriculture. The !Xun show two distinct Khoesan prehistories; while comparable to the female-derived Khoesan contribution to the amaXhosa Bantu, the male-derived Bantu contribution to the !Xun most likely represents cultural-driven gender-biased gene-flow. Emanating largely from male-derived European ancestral contributions, the Basters showed the highest maternal Khoesan contribution, while the Coloured showed the largest within population and regional-associated variability. The unique admixture fractions of the two latter populations reflect both early diverged and recently diverged human lineages.

"Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is causing severe economic losses worldwide in common and koi carp industries, and a safe and efficacious attenuated vaccine compatible with mass vaccination is needed. We produced single deleted recombinants using prokaryotic mutagenesis. When producing a recombinant lacking open reading frame 134 (ORF134), we unexpectedly obtained a clone with additional deletion of ORF56 and ORF57. This triple deleted recombinant replicated efficiently in vitro and expressed an in vivo safety/efficacy profile compatible with use as an attenuated vaccine. To determine the role of the double ORF56-57 deletion in the phenotype and to improve further the quality of the vaccine candidate, a series of deleted recombinants was produced and tested in vivo. These experiments led to the selection of a double deleted recombinant lacking ORF56 and ORF57 as a vaccine candidate. The safety and efficacy of this strain were studied using an in vivo bioluminescent imaging system (IVIS), qPCR, and histopathological examination, which demonstrated that it enters fish via skin infection similar to the wild type strain. However, compared to the parental wild type strain, the vaccine candidate replicated at lower levels and spread less efficiently to secondary sites of infection. Transmission experiments allowing water contamination with or without additional physical contact between fish demonstrated that the vaccine candidate has a reduced ability to spread from vaccinated fish to naïve sentinel cohabitants. Finally, IVIS analyses demonstrated that the vaccine candidate induces a protective mucosal immune response at the portal of entry. Thus, the present study is the first to report the rational development of a recombinant attenuated vaccine against CyHV-3 for mass vaccination of carp. We also demonstrated the relevance of the CyHV-3 carp model for studying alloherpesvirus transmission and mucosal immunity in teleost skin.
","Common carp, and its colorful ornamental variety koi, is one of the most economically valuable species in aquaculture. Since the late 1990s, the common and koi carp culture industries have suffered devastating worldwide losses due to cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3). In the present study, we report the development of an attenuated recombinant vaccine against CyHV-3. Two genes were deleted from the viral genome, leading to a recombinant virus that is no longer capable of causing the disease but can be propagated in cell culture (for vaccine production) and infect fish when added to the water, thereby immunizing the fish. This attenuated recombinant vaccine also had a drastic defect in spreading from vaccinated to non-vaccinated cohabitant fish. The vaccine induced a protective mucosal immune response capable of preventing the entry of virulent CyHV-3 and is compatible with the simultaneous vaccination of a large number of carp by simply immersing the fish in water containing the vaccine. This vaccine represents a promising tool for controlling the most dreadful disease ever encountered by the carp culture industries. In addition, the present study highlights the importance of the CyHV-3 - carp model for studying alloherpesvirus transmission and mucosal immunity in teleost skin.

"The encoding of sensory information in the human brain is thought to be optimised by two principal processes: ‘prediction’ uses stored information to guide the interpretation of forthcoming sensory events, and ‘attention’ prioritizes these events according to their behavioural relevance. Despite the ubiquitous contributions of attention and prediction to various aspects of perception and cognition, it remains unknown how they interact to modulate information processing in the brain. A recent extension of predictive coding theory suggests that attention optimises the expected precision of predictions by modulating the synaptic gain of prediction error units. Because prediction errors code for the difference between predictions and sensory signals, this model would suggest that attention increases the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to a surprising stimulus. Alternative predictive coding models propose that attention increases the activity of prediction (or ‘representation’) neurons and would therefore suggest that attention and prediction synergistically modulate selectivity for ‘feature information’ in the brain. Here, we applied forward encoding models to neural activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) as human observers performed a simple visual task to test for the effect of attention on both mismatch and feature information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. Participants attended or ignored a periodic stream of gratings, the orientations of which could be either predictable, surprising, or unpredictable. We found that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features, and that attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. These findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction modulate information processing in the brain, as well as support the theory that attention optimises precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.
","The human brain is theorised to operate like a sophisticated hypothesis tester, using past experience to generate a model of the external world, testing predictions of this model against incoming sensory evidence, and generating a ‘prediction error’ signal that updates the model when predictions and sensory evidence do not match. In addition to predicting the content of sensory signals, an optimal system should also predict the reliability (or ‘precision’) of those signals to minimise the influence of unreliable sensory information. It has been proposed that attention optimises this process by boosting prediction error signals, which are coded as the difference (or ‘mismatch’) between predicted and observed stimulus features. Accordingly, this theory predicts that attention should increase the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. We tested this hypothesis in human participants by training a decoding algorithm to identify ‘mismatch information’ in the brain, recorded by electroencephalography (EEG), following the presentation of surprising stimuli that were either attended or ignored. We found that attention did indeed increase the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response, supporting the notion that attention and prediction are intricately related processes.

"In spite of the importance of hyaluronan in host protection against infectious organisms in the alveolar spaces, its role in mycobacterial infection is unknown. In a previous study, we found that mycobacteria interact with hyaluronan on lung epithelial cells. Here, we have analyzed the role of hyaluronan after mycobacterial infection was established and found that pathogenic mycobacteria can grow by utilizing hyaluronan as a carbon source. Both mouse and human possess 3 kinds of hyaluronan synthases (HAS), designated HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3. Utilizing individual HAS-transfected cells, we show that HAS1 and HAS3 but not HAS2 support growth of mycobacteria. We found that the major hyaluronan synthase expressed in the lung is HAS1, and that its expression was increased after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that hyaluronan profoundly accumulated in the granulomatous legion of the lungs in M. tuberculosis-infected mice and rhesus monkeys that died from tuberculosis. We detected hyaluronidase activity in the lysate of mycobacteria and showed that it was critical for hyaluronan-dependent extracellular growth. Finally, we showed that L-Ascorbic acid 6-hexadecanoate, a hyaluronidase inhibitor, suppressed growth of mycobacteria in vivo. Taken together, our data show that pathogenic mycobacteria exploit an intrinsic host-protective molecule, hyaluronan, to grow in the respiratory tract and demonstrate the potential usefulness of hyaluronidase inhibitors against mycobacterial diseases.
","Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis are major bacterial pathogens that kill approximately 2 million people annually by causing tuberculosis. The M. tuberculosis complex has several strategies to parasitize the host. After infection is established, these pathogens are rarely eliminated from the host, and nowadays approximately a third of the world's human population is infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The elucidation of the parasitic mechanisms of the M. tuberculosis complex is important for the development of novel strategies against the disease. The major portal entry of M. tuberculosis complex is through the respiratory tract. On the surface of the airway, hyaluronan retains bactericidal enzymes so that they are “ready-to-use”, protecting tissues from invading pathogens. Furthermore, fragmented hyaluronan produced as a result of infection is used by the immune system as a sensor of infection. Thus, hyaluronan plays a pivotal role in host defenses in the respiratory tract. However, in this study, we observed that the M. tuberculosis complex utilizes hyaluronan as a carbon source for multiplication. We also found that the M. tuberculosis complex has hyaluronidase activity and showed that it is critical for hyaluronan-dependent growth of the M. tuberculosis complex. This study demonstrates a novel parasitic mechanism of the M. tuberculosis complex and suggests that mycobacterial hyaluronidase is a potential drug target.

"Riboswitches sense cellular concentrations of small molecules and use this information to adjust synthesis rates of related metabolites. Riboswitches include an aptamer domain to detect the ligand and an expression platform to control gene expression. Previous structural studies of riboswitches largely focused on aptamers, truncating the expression domain to suppress conformational switching. To link ligand/aptamer binding to conformational switching, we constructed models of an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-I riboswitch RNA segment incorporating elements of the expression platform, allowing formation of an antiterminator (AT) helix. Using Anton, a computer specially developed for long timescale Molecular Dynamics (MD), we simulated an extended (three microseconds) MD trajectory with SAM bound to a modeled riboswitch RNA segment. Remarkably, we observed a strand migration, converting three base pairs from an antiterminator (AT) helix, characteristic of the transcription ON state, to a P1 helix, characteristic of the OFF state. This conformational switching towards the OFF state is observed only in the presence of SAM. Among seven extended trajectories with three starting structures, the presence of SAM enhances the trend towards the OFF state for two out of three starting structures tested. Our simulation provides a visual demonstration of how a small molecule (<500 MW) binding to a limited surface can trigger a large scale conformational rearrangement in a 40 kDa RNA by perturbing the Free Energy Landscape. Such a mechanism can explain minimal requirements for SAM binding and transcription termination for SAM-I riboswitches previously reported experimentally.
","Folding dynamics is crucial for RNA function. Riboswitches are a classic example. A typical riboswitch senses the cellular concentration of a small molecule. By refolding itself into a new structure, the riboswitch converts that information into changes in rates for synthesis of related metabolites. Understanding how the small molecule physically changes RNA structure can help us to target riboswitches, which occur mainly in bacteria, for drug design, or to engineer new riboswitches. This understanding has been blocked because 1) we cannot view intermediate stages experimentally and 2) simulations cannot reach the timescale for the structural conversion. Recent advances in RNA structure modeling enable us to model intermediate states. A new computer specialized for long timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, called Anton, helps us to extend the simulation timescale. We modeled intermediate riboswitch structures, focusing on a reduced segment of the structure-switching region, in order to reduce the time required for a transition. We simulated an MD trajectory in which a small molecule converted the structure of this reduced switching region. Some steps in riboswitch structural transitions are therefore accessible to the newly extended MD timescale. Wider availability of resources like Anton can aid the advancement of riboswitch engineering and novel antibiotic design.

"Synaptic wiring of neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans is largely
                    invariable between animals. It has been suggested that this feature stems from
                    genetically encoded molecular markers that guide the neurons in the final stage
                    of synaptic formation. Identifying these markers and unraveling the logic by
                    which they direct synapse formation is a key challenge. Here, we address this
                    task by constructing a probabilistic model that attempts to explain the neuronal
                    connectivity diagram of C. elegans as a function of the
                    expression patterns of its neurons. By only considering neuron pairs that are
                    known to be connected by chemical or electrical synapses, we focus on the final
                    stage of synapse formation, in which neurons identify their designated partners.
                    Our results show that for many neurons the neuronal expression map of C.
                        elegans can be used to accurately predict the subset of adjacent
                    neurons that will be chosen as its postsynaptic partners. Notably, these
                    predictions can be achieved using the expression patterns of only a small number
                    of specific genes that interact in a combinatorial fashion.
","Synaptic wiring in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is
                    largely invariant between individuals, suggesting that this wiring is
                    genetically encoded. This is in essence the chemoaffinity hypothesis suggested
                    by Roger Sperry. However, proving this hypothesis in model organisms and
                    detecting the identities of the genes that determine the presence or absence of
                    synaptic connections is a major challenge. C. elegans provides
                    a unique opportunity to examine this hypothesis due to the availability of both
                    its neuronal wiring diagram and neuronal gene expression map. In this study we
                    show that the neuronal gene expression profiles can be used to predict the
                    subset of adjacent neurons that each neuron will connect to with good accuracy.
                    We further identify a small set of putative genes on both sides of the synapses
                    that interact in a combinatorial fashion and mediate the neuronal partner
                    selection process. The modular design in which a small set of components is
                    reutilized throughout the network is common with other known biological systems
                    and raises the possibility of a similar design in neuronal networks of more
                    complex organisms.

"Globally, about 1.5 billion people are infected with at least one species of soil-transmitted helminth (STH). Soil is a critical environmental reservoir of STH, yet there is no standard method for detecting STH eggs in soil. We developed a field method for enumerating STH eggs in soil and tested the method in Bangladesh and Kenya. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) method for enumerating Ascaris eggs in biosolids was modified through a series of recovery efficiency experiments; we seeded soil samples with a known number of Ascaris suum eggs and assessed the effect of protocol modifications on egg recovery. We found the use of 1% 7X as a surfactant compared to 0.1% Tween 80 significantly improved recovery efficiency (two-sided t-test, t = 5.03, p = 0.007) while other protocol modifications—including different agitation and flotation methods—did not have a significant impact. Soil texture affected the egg recovery efficiency; sandy samples resulted in higher recovery compared to loamy samples processed using the same method (two-sided t-test, t = 2.56, p = 0.083). We documented a recovery efficiency of 73% for the final improved method using loamy soil in the lab. To field test the improved method, we processed soil samples from 100 households in Bangladesh and 100 households in Kenya from June to November 2015. The prevalence of any STH (Ascaris, Trichuris or hookworm) egg in soil was 78% in Bangladesh and 37% in Kenya. The median concentration of STH eggs in soil in positive samples was 0.59 eggs/g dry soil in Bangladesh and 0.15 eggs/g dry soil in Kenya. The prevalence of STH eggs in soil was significantly higher in Bangladesh than Kenya (chi-square, χ2 = 34.39, p < 0.001) as was the concentration (Mann-Whitney, z = 7.10, p < 0.001). This new method allows for detecting STH eggs in soil in low-resource settings and could be used for standardizing soil STH detection globally.
","Intestinal worm infections are common in populations living in tropical, low-income countries. People primarily become infected when they consume intestinal worm eggs from contaminated water, hands, and food. Intestinal worm eggs are transmitted from infected people and spread through the environment, particularly via soil. There is no standard laboratory method for counting intestinal worm eggs in soil, which is a major barrier to comprehensive research on the transmission of infection. We tested different laboratory protocol steps to extract soil-transmitted helminth eggs, which is one type of intestinal worm, from soil and propose a new, fast, and efficient field method. We tested the method in Kenya and Bangladesh and found that soil contamination with helminth eggs was prevalent in both study areas. We propose that environmental contamination be included in discussions about intestinal worm transmission, control, and elimination, especially in areas with low infection prevalence. The method we propose will help researchers assess soil contamination, which can be used to examine the effectiveness of intestinal worm transmission control measures.

"The HLA-C gene appears to have evolved in higher primates to serve as a dominant source of ligands for the KIR2D family of inhibitory MHC class I receptors. The expression of NK cell-intrinsic MHC class I has been shown to regulate the murine Ly49 family of MHC class I receptors due to the interaction of these receptors with NK cell MHC in cis. However, cis interactions have not been demonstrated for the human KIR and HLA proteins. We report the discovery of an elaborate NK cell-specific system regulating HLA-C expression, indicating an important role for HLA-C in the development and function of NK cells. A large array of alternative transcripts with differences in intron/exon content are generated from an upstream NK-specific HLA-C promoter, and exon content varies between HLA-C alleles due to SNPs in splice donor/acceptor sites. Skipping of the first coding exon of HLA-C generates a subset of untranslatable mRNAs, and the proportion of untranslatable HLA-C mRNA decreases as NK cells mature, correlating with increased protein expression by mature NK cells. Polymorphism in a key Ets-binding site of the NK promoter has generated HLA-C alleles that lack significant promoter activity, resulting in reduced HLA-C expression and increased functional activity. The NK-intrinsic regulation of HLA-C thus represents a novel mechanism controlling the lytic activity of NK cells during development.
","It has been proposed that the human HLA-C gene evolved in higher primates to serve as a ligand for the KIR family of inhibitory receptors for MHC class I that are expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and regulate their activity. NK cell potential is determined by the level of MHC class I on surrounding cells and on the NK cell itself. We have uncovered a highly complex system regulating HLA-C expression in NK cells. A NK-specific promoter produces a large array of differentially-spliced transcripts that vary in their ability to be translated into HLA-C protein. As NK cells differentiate and become more cytotoxic, the level of HLA-C expression increases, and this correlates with an increased abundance of translatable HLA-C mRNAs. A subset of HLA-C alleles have a promoter polymorphism that abrogates its activity, resulting in NK cells that are unable to upregulate HLA-C levels, and consequently, possess increased functional activity. Overall, our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of NK cell development, as well as a method to identify individuals with high NK activity, that may provide superior outcomes in hematopoietic stem cell transfer.

"PRP4 encodes the only kinase among the spliceosome components. Although it is an essential gene in the fission yeast and other eukaryotic organisms, the Fgprp4 mutant was viable in the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum. Deletion of FgPRP4 did not block intron splicing but affected intron splicing efficiency in over 60% of the F. graminearum genes. The Fgprp4 mutant had severe growth defects and produced spontaneous suppressors that were recovered in growth rate. Suppressor mutations were identified in the PRP6, PRP31, BRR2, and PRP8 orthologs in nine suppressor strains by sequencing analysis with candidate tri-snRNP component genes. The Q86K mutation in FgMSL1 was identified by whole genome sequencing in suppressor mutant S3. Whereas two of the suppressor mutations in FgBrr2 and FgPrp8 were similar to those characterized in their orthologs in yeasts, suppressor mutations in Prp6 and Prp31 orthologs or FgMSL1 have not been reported. Interestingly, four and two suppressor mutations identified in FgPrp6 and FgPrp31, respectively, all are near the conserved Prp4-phosphorylation sites, suggesting that these mutations may have similar effects with phosphorylation by Prp4 kinase. In FgPrp31, the non-sense mutation at R464 resulted in the truncation of the C-terminal 130 aa region that contains all the conserved Prp4-phosphorylation sites. Deletion analysis showed that the N-terminal 310-aa rich in SR residues plays a critical role in the localization and functions of FgPrp4. We also conducted phosphoproteomics analysis with FgPrp4 and identified S289 as the phosphorylation site that is essential for its functions. These results indicated that FgPrp4 is critical for splicing efficiency but not essential for intron splicing, and FgPrp4 may regulate pre-mRNA splicing by phosphorylation of other components of the tri-snRNP although itself may be activated by phosphorylation at S289.
","In eukaryotic organisms, many genes containing introns that need to be spliced by the spliceosome after transcription. Among all the spliceosome components, Prp4 is the only protein kinase. Unlike other organisms, deletion of the FgPRP4 kinase gene was not lethal in the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum. In this study, we found that FgPRP4 is not essential for intron splicing but important for splicing efficiency. The Fgprp4 mutant was not stable and produced spontaneous suppressors recovered in growth rate. Suppressor mutations were identified in the PRP6, PRP31, BRR2, and PRP8 orthologs, key components of the U4/U6-U5 complex in the spliceosome and FgMSL1 by candidate gene or whole genome sequencing. We also showed that the N-terminal 310 amino acid region of FgPrp4 plays a critical role in its localization and functions of FgPrp4 and identified S289 as a critical phosphorylation site. Overall, our result indicated that FgPrp4 is important for splicing efficiency, possibly by phosphorylation of other spliceosome components.

"Phagocytosis requires locally coordinated cytoskeletal rearrangements driven by actin polymerization and myosin motor activity. How this actomyosin dynamics is dependent upon systems that provide access to ATP at phagosome microdomains has not been determined. We analyzed the role of brain-type creatine kinase (CK-B), an enzyme involved in high-energy phosphoryl transfer. We demonstrate that endogenous CK-B in macrophages is mobilized from the cytosolic pool and coaccumulates with F-actin at nascent phagosomes. Live cell imaging with XFP-tagged CK-B and β-actin revealed the transient and specific nature of this partitioning process. Overexpression of a catalytic dead CK-B or CK-specific cyclocreatine inhibition caused a significant reduction of actin accumulation in the phagocytic cup area, and reduced complement receptor–mediated, but not Fc-γR–mediated, ingestion capacity of macrophages. Finally, we found that inhibition of CK-B affected phagocytosis already at the stage of particle adhesion, most likely via effects on actin polymerization behavior. We propose that CK-B activity in macrophages contributes to complement-induced F-actin assembly events in early phagocytosis by providing local ATP supply.
","To do work, cells need energy in the form of ATP. High and sudden energy demand is seen during cell-shape change, a process in which ATP fuels the cytoskeletal machinery that drives cell-morphology alteration. How a cell organizes high-energy surges without disrupting global ATP homeostasis remains an important research question. One view proposes that ATP is heterogeneously distributed, but the cytoskeletal proteins actin and myosin receive regional and preferential access to ATP. Yet this model raises another question: how is ATP funneled to these proteins from distant sources? To address some of these questions, we studied the highly localized molecular events controlling actin dynamics around phagocytic activity of macrophages. We demonstrate that actin and creatine kinase-B (CK-B), a long-known enzyme involved in ATP supply, are simultaneously recruited into the sites of action during the early phases of particle ingestion. Local availability of CK-activity and local generation of ATP promotes on-site actin remodeling and particle capture efficiency, and thus supports successful initiation of the first phases of phagocytosis. Interestingly, this coupling between local CK-activity and actin regulation is only relevant for complement-mediated phagocytosis (used by immune cells to target specific particles for ingestion). We predict that our findings may also shed light on how shape dynamics is energized in other cell types.

"Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) is a method for analyzing multiple sequence alignments that was used to identify groups of coevolving residues termed “sectors”. The method applies spectral analysis to a matrix obtained by combining correlation information with sequence conservation. It has been asserted that the protein sectors identified by SCA are functionally significant, with different sectors controlling different biochemical properties of the protein. Here we reconsider the available experimental data and note that it involves almost exclusively proteins with a single sector. We show that in this case sequence conservation is the dominating factor in SCA, and can alone be used to make statistically equivalent functional predictions. Therefore, we suggest shifting the experimental focus to proteins for which SCA identifies several sectors. Correlations in protein alignments, which have been shown to be informative in a number of independent studies, would then be less dominated by sequence conservation.
","Statistical analyses of alignments of evolutionarily related protein sequences have been proposed as a method for obtaining information about protein structure and function. One such method, called statistical coupling analysis, identifies patterns of correlated mutations and uses them to find groups of coevolving residues. These groups, called protein sectors, have been reported to be relevant for various functional aspects, such as enzymatic efficiency, protein stability, or allostery. Here, we reanalyze existing data in order to assess the relative importance of two factors contributing to statistical coupling analysis, namely single-site amino acid frequencies and pairwise correlations. Although correlations have been shown to be informative in other studies, we point out that in existing large-scale data that has been analyzed with statistical coupling analysis, single-site statistics seems to be a dominating factor.

"Cells transition from spread to rounded morphologies in diverse physiological contexts including mitosis and mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transitions. When these drastic shape changes occur rapidly, cell volume and surface area are approximately conserved. Consequently, the rounded cells are suddenly presented with a several-fold excess of cell surface whose area far exceeds that of a smooth sphere enclosing the cell volume. This excess is stored in a population of bleb-like protrusions (BLiPs), whose size distribution is shown by electron micrographs to be skewed. We introduce three complementary models of rounded cell morphologies with a prescribed excess surface area. A 2D Hamiltonian model provides a mechanistic description of how discrete attachment points between the cell surface and cortex together with surface bending energy can generate a morphology that satisfies a prescribed excess area and BLiP number density. A 3D random seed-and-growth model simulates efficient packing of BLiPs over a primary rounded shape, demonstrating a pathway for skewed BLiP size distributions that recapitulate 3D morphologies. Finally, a phase field model (2D and 3D) posits energy-based constitutive laws for the cell membrane, nematic F-actin cortex, interior cytosol, and external aqueous medium. The cell surface is equipped with a spontaneous curvature function, a proxy for the cell surface-cortex couple, that is a priori unknown, which the model “learns” from the thin section transmission electron micrograph image (2D) or the “seed and growth” model image (3D). Converged phase field simulations predict self-consistent amplitudes and spatial localization of pressure and stress throughout the cell for any posited stationary morphology target and cell compartment constitutive properties. The models form a general framework for future studies of cell morphological dynamics in a variety of biological contexts.
","Individual cells must have the capability for rapid morphological transformations under various physiological conditions. One of the most drastic shape transformations occurs during the transition from spread to rounded morphologies. When this transition occurs rapidly, there is insufficient time for significant changes in surface area to occur, although the final size of the rounded cell indicates a significant reduction in apparent cell surface area at light microscope resolution. By contrast, high-resolution scanning electron micrographs of rapidly rounded cells reveal that a large amount of surface area is stored in a highly convoluted surface morphology consisting of bleb-like protrusions (BLiPs) and other small structures that are unrecognizable at lower resolution. This surface reserve is an important part of the mechanism that allows rapid and efficient large scale transformations of cell shape. Remarkably, although this convoluted morphology has been observed for decades, there has been very little effort recognizing and including this surface surplus in mathematical modeling of cell morphology and physiology. In this paper, we develop three complementary models to fill this void and lay the foundation for future investigations of the mechanisms that drive cellular morphological dynamics.

"Biomphalaria glabrata snails that display either resistant or susceptible phenotypes to the parasitic trematode, Schistosoma mansoni provide an invaluable resource towards elucidating the molecular basis of the snail-host/schistosome relationship. Previously, we showed that induction of stress genes either after heat-shock or parasite infection was a major feature distinguishing juvenile susceptible snails from their resistant counterparts. In order to examine this apparent association between heat stress and snail susceptibility, we investigated the effect of temperature modulation in the resistant snail stock, BS-90. Here, we show that, incubated for up to 4 hrs at 32°C prior to infection, these resistant snails became susceptible to infection, i.e. shedding cercariae at 5 weeks post exposure (PE) while unstressed resistant snails, as expected, remained resistant. This suggests that susceptibility to infection by this resistant snail phenotype is temperature-sensitive (ts). Additionally, resistant snails treated with the Hsp 90 specific inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA) after heat stress, were no longer susceptible to infection, retaining their resistant phenotype. Consistently, susceptible snail phenotypes treated with 100 mM GA before parasite exposure also remained uninfected. These results provide direct evidence for the induction of stress genes (heat shock proteins; Hsp 70, Hsp 90 and the reverse transcriptase [RT] domain of the nimbus non-LTR retrotransposon) in B. glabrata susceptibility to S. mansoni infection and characterize the resistant BS-90 snails as a temperature-sensitive phenotype. This study of reversing snail susceptibility phenotypes to S. mansoni provides an opportunity to directly track molecular pathway(s) that underlie the B. glabrata snail's ability to either sustain or destroy the S. mansoni parasite.
","Biomphalaria glabrata snails that are either resistant or susceptible to the parasite, Schistosoma mansoni, have been an invaluable resource in studies aimed at understanding the molecular basis of the snail/schistosome interaction. Schistosomes cause the chronic debilitating disease schistosomiasis. Thus, it is hoped that dissecting pathways that underlie the snail/schistosome relationship might translate into alternative control strategies that will include blocking transmission of the parasite at the snail-stage of its development. Induction of stress genes is a feature distinguishing early exposed juvenile susceptible NMRI snails from resistant BS-90 snail stocks. To further analyze this apparent involvement of stress induction and snail susceptibility, here we applied heat stress to the resistant BS-90 snail, enhancing induction of stress genes (Hsp 70, Hsp 90 and RT) prior to infection. Results showed these resistant snails became susceptible, indicating resistance as being a temperature sensitive phenotype in these snails. Stressed resistant snails treated with the Hsp 90 specific inhibitor, geldanamycin, prior to exposure, were, however, shown to maintain their refractory phenotype. Interestingly, inhibitor treated susceptible snails also became non-susceptible. Collectively, these data point to stress induction as an important early step in the ability of S. mansoni to infect juvenile B. glabrata snails.

"Challenges in maintaining high effectiveness of classic vector control in urban areas has renewed the interest in indoor residual spraying (IRS) as a promising approach for Aedes-borne disease prevention. While IRS has many benefits, application time and intrusive indoor applications make its scalability in urban areas difficult. Modifying IRS to account for Ae. aegypti resting behavior, named targeted IRS (TIRS, spraying walls below 1.5 m and under furniture) can reduce application time; however, an untested assumption is that modifications to IRS will not negatively impact entomological efficacy. We conducted a comparative experimental study evaluating the residual efficacy of classically-applied IRS (as developed for malaria control) compared to two TIRS application methods using a carbamate insecticide against a pyrethroid-resistant, field-derived Ae. aegypti strain. We performed our study within a novel experimental house setting (n = 9 houses) located in Merida (Mexico), with similar layouts and standardized contents. Classic IRS application (insecticide applied to full walls and under furniture) was compared to: a) TIRS: insecticide applied to walls below 1.5 m and under furniture, and b) Resting Site TIRS (RS-TIRS): insecticide applied only under furniture. Mosquito mortality was measured eight times post-application (out to six months post-application) by releasing 100 Ae. aegypti females /house and collecting live and dead individuals after 24 hrs exposure. Compared to Classic IRS, TIRS and RS-TIRS took less time to apply (31% and 82% reduction, respectively) and used less insecticide (38% and 85% reduction, respectively). Mortality of pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti did not significantly differ among the three IRS application methods up to two months post application, and did not significantly differ between Classic IRS and TIRS up to four months post application. These data illustrate that optimizing IRS to more efficiently target Ae. aegypti can both reduce application time and insecticide volume with no apparent reduction in entomological efficacy.
","Vector control is the primary strategy for managing Aedes aegypti and reducing transmission of Aedes-borne diseases; however, the indoor resting behavior of Ae. aegypti and the evolution of insecticide resistance reduces the effectiveness of many vector control tactics. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is effective against Ae. aegypti, but lengthy application time makes IRS difficult to scale within urban environments. We compared the application and entomological efficacy of Classic IRS against two novel Aedes-targeting IRS application methods (Targeted IRS [TIRS]- insecticide applied to walls below 1.5 m and under furniture and Resting Site TIRS [RS-TIRS]- insecticide applied only under furniture) within experimental houses using a carbamate insecticide. Both TIRS and RS-TIRS took less time to apply and used less insecticide compared to Classic IRS. Mortality of pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti did not differ among treatments out to two months post-application, and there was no difference in mortality between Classic IRS and TIRS out to four months post-application. These data provide evidence that IRS application methods can be improved to take less time and insecticide yet not lose entomological efficacy, making TIRS more scalable within urban environments. However, larger field studies with epidemiologic endpoints are needed to further assess the efficacy of these modified TIRS techniques.

"Dynamic modification of histone proteins plays a key role in regulating gene expression. However, histones themselves can also be dynamic, which potentially affects the stability of histone modifications. To determine the molecular mechanisms of histone turnover, we developed a parallel screening method for epigenetic regulators by analyzing chromatin states on DNA barcodes. Histone turnover was quantified by employing a genetic pulse-chase technique called RITE, which was combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing. In this screen, the NuB4/HAT-B complex, containing the conserved type B histone acetyltransferase Hat1, was found to promote histone turnover. Unexpectedly, the three members of this complex could be functionally separated from each other as well as from the known interacting factor and histone chaperone Asf1. Thus, systematic and direct interrogation of chromatin structure on DNA barcodes can lead to the discovery of genes and pathways involved in chromatin modification and dynamics.
","Packaging of eukaryotic genomes by the histone proteins influences many processes that use the DNA, such as transcription, repair, and replication. One well-known mechanism of regulation of histone function is the covalent modification of histone proteins. Replacement of modified histones by new histones has recently emerged as an additional layer of regulation (hereafter referred to as histone turnover). Although histone replacement can affect substantial parts of eukaryotic genomes, the mechanisms that control histone exchange are largely unknown. Here, we report a screening method for epigenetic regulators that we applied to search for histone exchange factors. The screening method is based on our finding that global chromatin changes in mutant cells can be inferred from chromatin states on short DNA barcodes. By analyzing the chromatin status of DNA barcodes of many yeast mutants in parallel, we identified positive and negative regulators of histone exchange. In particular, we find that the HAT-B complex promotes histone turnover. HAT-B is known to acetylate the tails of newly synthesized histones, but its role in chromatin assembly has been unclear. Hif1, the nuclear binding partner of HAT-B in the NuB4 complex, also promotes histone exchange but by non-overlapping mechanisms. These results provide a new perspective on pathways of histone exchange.

"Current climate change may be a major threat to global biodiversity, but the extent of species loss will depend on the details of how species respond to changing climates. For example, if most species can undergo rapid change in their climatic niches, then extinctions may be limited. Numerous studies have now documented shifts in the geographic ranges of species that were inferred to be related to climate change, especially shifts towards higher mean elevations and latitudes. Many of these studies contain valuable data on extinctions of local populations that have not yet been thoroughly explored. Specifically, overall range shifts can include range contractions at the “warm edges” of species’ ranges (i.e., lower latitudes and elevations), contractions which occur through local extinctions. Here, data on climate-related range shifts were used to test the frequency of local extinctions related to recent climate change. The results show that climate-related local extinctions have already occurred in hundreds of species, including 47% of the 976 species surveyed. This frequency of local extinctions was broadly similar across climatic zones, clades, and habitats but was significantly higher in tropical species than in temperate species (55% versus 39%), in animals than in plants (50% versus 39%), and in freshwater habitats relative to terrestrial and marine habitats (74% versus 46% versus 51%). Overall, these results suggest that local extinctions related to climate change are already widespread, even though levels of climate change so far are modest relative to those predicted in the next 100 years. These extinctions will presumably become much more prevalent as global warming increases further by roughly 2-fold to 5-fold over the coming decades.
","Climate change is an important threat to the world’s plant and animal species, including species on which humans depend. However, predicting how species will respond to future climate change is very difficult. In this study, I analyze the extinctions caused by the climate change that has already occurred. Numerous studies find that species are shifting their geographic ranges in response to climate change, typically moving to higher elevations and latitudes. These studies also contain valuable data on local extinctions, as they document the loss of populations at the “warm edge” of species’ ranges (lower elevations and latitudes). Here, I use these data to show that recent local extinctions related to climate change have already occurred in hundreds of species around the world. Specifically, among 976 species surveyed, local extinctions occurred in 47%. These extinctions are common across climatic zones, habitats, and groups of organisms but are especially common in tropical regions (which contain most of Earth’s species), in animals (relative to plants), and in freshwater habitats. In summary, this study reveals local extinctions in hundreds of species related to the limited global warming that has already occurred. These extinctions will almost certainly increase as global climate continues to warm in the coming decades.

"During quiet resting behavior, involuntary movements are suppressed. Such movement control is attributed to cortico-basal ganglia loops, yet population dynamics within these loops during resting and their relation to involuntary movements are not well characterized. Here, we show by recording cortical and striatal ongoing population activity in awake rats during quiet resting that intrastriatal inhibition maintains a low-correlation striatal resting state in the presence of cortical neuronal avalanches. Involuntary movements arise from disturbed striatal resting activity through two different population dynamics. Nonselectively reducing intrastriatal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-A inhibition synchronizes striatal dynamics, leading to involuntary movements at low rate. In contrast, reducing striatal interneuron (IN)-mediated inhibition maintains decorrelation and induces intermittent involuntary movements at high rate. This latter scenario was highly effective in modulating cortical dynamics at a subsecond timescale. To distinguish intrastriatal processing from loop dynamics, cortex-striatum-midbrain cultures, which lack feedback to cortex, were used. Cortical avalanches in vitro were accompanied by low-correlated resting activity in the striatum and nonselective reduction in striatal inhibition synchronized striatal neurons similar to in vivo. Importantly, reduction of inhibition from striatal INs maintained low correlations in the striatum while reorganizing functional connectivities among striatal neurons. Our results demonstrate the importance of two major striatal microcircuits in distinctly regulating striatal and cortical resting state dynamics. These findings suggest that specific functional connectivities of the striatum that are maintained by local inhibition are important in movement control.
","Even in the absence of apparent motor output, the brain produces a rich repertoire of neuronal activity patterns known as “resting state” activity. In the outer layer of the cortex, resting state patterns emerge as neuronal avalanches, precisely scale-invariant spatiotemporal bursts that often engage large populations of neurons. Little is known about how the brain suppresses involuntary movements during such activity. Here, we show that the striatum, which is part of the cortex-basal ganglia loop, maintains a low-correlation state during resting activity. By using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches with pharmacological manipulations, we demonstrate that the precise configuration of this low-correlation state effectively contributes to involuntary movements. Nonselective blockade of intra-striatal inhibition abolished the low-correlation striatal resting state, barely affected cortical avalanches, and led to involuntary movements at low rate. In contrast, selectively reducing striatal interneuron inhibition strongly affected cortical avalanches and triggered involuntary movements at high rate while maintaining a relatively decorrelated striatal resting state. Our results demonstrate the importance of different inhibitory striatal circuits in the suppression of involuntary movements and suggest that the precise spatiotemporal configuration of striatal activity plays an active role in the regulation of cortical resting state activity and motor control.

"Symptoms of schizophrenia may arise from a failure of cortical circuits to filter-out irrelevant inputs. Schizophrenia has also been linked to disruptions in cortical inhibitory interneurons, consistent with the possibility that in the normally functioning brain, these cells are in some part responsible for determining which sensory inputs are relevant versus irrelevant. Here, we develop a neural network model that demonstrates how the cortex may learn to ignore irrelevant inputs through plasticity processes affecting inhibition. The model is based on the proposal that the amount of excitatory output from a cortical circuit encodes the expected magnitude of reward or punishment (“relevance”), which can be trained using a temporal difference learning mechanism acting on feedforward inputs to inhibitory interneurons. In the model, irrelevant and blocked stimuli drive lower levels of excitatory activity compared with novel and relevant stimuli, and this difference in activity levels is lost following disruptions to inhibitory units. When excitatory units are connected to a competitive-learning output layer with a threshold, the relevance code can be shown to “gate” both learning and behavioral responses to irrelevant stimuli. Accordingly, the combined network is capable of recapitulating published experimental data linking inhibition in frontal cortex with fear learning and expression. Finally, the model demonstrates how relevance learning can take place in parallel with other types of learning, through plasticity rules involving inhibitory and excitatory components, respectively. Altogether, this work offers a theory of how the cortex learns to selectively inhibit inputs, providing insight into how relevance-assignment problems may emerge in schizophrenia.
","Individuals with schizophrenia have difficulty ignoring ideas and experiences that most people would treat as unimportant. There is evidence that this may be due to changes in neuronal inhibition, suggesting that inhibitory neurons may be involved in learning to ignore irrelevant inputs. By developing a computational model that learns relevance and irrelevance through changes in the strength of feedforward inhibition, we are able to simulate many specific effects of inhibitory neuron dysfunction on behavior. We also show two computational advantages to this mechanism: (1) if relevance is signaled by the level of excitatory activity, then downstream circuits can easily avoid learning from irrelevant stimuli, (2) relevance learning can occur simultaneously with other types of learning. The model therefore offers insight into the relationships between neural inhibition and behavior, including symptoms of schizophrenia.

"Levels of G1 cyclins fluctuate in response to environmental cues and couple mitotic signaling to cell cycle entry. The G1 cyclin Cln3 is a key regulator of cell size and cell cycle entry in budding yeast. Cln3 degradation is essential for proper cell cycle control; however, the mechanisms that control Cln3 degradation are largely unknown. Here we show that two SCF ubiquitin ligases, SCFCdc4 and SCFGrr1, redundantly target Cln3 for degradation. While the F-box proteins (FBPs) Cdc4 and Grr1 were previously thought to target non-overlapping sets of substrates, we find that Cdc4 and Grr1 each bind to all 3 G1 cyclins in cell extracts, yet only Cln3 is redundantly targeted in vivo, due in part to its nuclear localization. The related cyclin Cln2 is cytoplasmic and exclusively targeted by Grr1. However, Cdc4 can interact with Cdk-phosphorylated Cln2 and target it for degradation when cytoplasmic Cdc4 localization is forced in vivo. These findings suggest that Cdc4 and Grr1 may share additional redundant targets and, consistent with this possibility, grr1Δ cdc4-1 cells demonstrate a CLN3-independent synergistic growth defect. Our findings demonstrate that structurally distinct FBPs are capable of interacting with some of the same substrates; however, in vivo specificity is achieved in part by subcellular localization. Additionally, the FBPs Cdc4 and Grr1 are partially redundant for proliferation and viability, likely sharing additional redundant substrates whose degradation is important for cell cycle progression.
","Most cells only divide when they receive the proper cues. When a cell receives a signal to divide, levels of G1 cyclin proteins increase and drive entry into the cell division cycle. Overexpression of G1 cyclins can drive cells into the cell cycle inappropriately and thus may contribute to the hyperproliferation of cancer cells. Despite the importance of controlling G1 cyclin levels, the mechanisms regulating the degradation of these proteins are not well understood. We have now elucidated the mechanism of degradation of the yeast G1 cyclin Cln3. In contrast to related cyclins in yeast, Cln3 is targeted for degradation by two redundant pathways, which act to keep Cln3 levels extremely low. This finding may have implications for understanding how G1 cyclins are degraded in human cells and how expression of G1 cyclins may be misregulated during cancer development.

"Genomic instability associated with DNA replication stress is linked to cancer and genetic pathologies in humans. If not properly regulated, replication stress, such as fork stalling and collapse, can be induced at natural replication impediments present throughout the genome. The fork protection complex (FPC) is thought to play a critical role in stabilizing stalled replication forks at several known replication barriers including eukaryotic rDNA genes and the fission yeast mating-type locus. However, little is known about the role of the FPC at other natural impediments including telomeres. Telomeres are considered to be difficult to replicate due to the presence of repetitive GT-rich sequences and telomere-binding proteins. However, the regulatory mechanism that ensures telomere replication is not fully understood. Here, we report the role of the fission yeast Swi1Timeless, a subunit of the FPC, in telomere replication. Loss of Swi1 causes telomere shortening in a telomerase-independent manner. Our epistasis analyses suggest that heterochromatin and telomere-binding proteins are not major impediments for telomere replication in the absence of Swi1. Instead, repetitive DNA sequences impair telomere integrity in swi1Δ mutant cells, leading to the loss of repeat DNA. In the absence of Swi1, telomere shortening is accompanied with an increased recruitment of Rad52 recombinase and more frequent amplification of telomere/subtelomeres, reminiscent of tumor cells that utilize the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway (ALT) to maintain telomeres. These results suggest that Swi1 ensures telomere replication by suppressing recombination and repeat instability at telomeres. Our studies may also be relevant in understanding the potential role of Swi1Timeless in regulation of telomere stability in cancer cells.
","In every round of the cell cycle, cells must accurately replicate their full genetic information. This process is highly regulated, as defects during DNA replication cause genomic instability, leading to various genetic disorders including cancers. To thwart these problems, cells carry an array of complex mechanisms to deal with various obstacles found across the genome that can hamper DNA replication and cause DNA damage. Understanding how these mechanisms are regulated and orchestrated is of paramount importance in the field. In this report, we describe how Swi1, a Timeless-related protein in fission yeast, regulates efficient replication of telomeres, which are considered to be difficult to replicate due to the presence of repetitive DNA and telomere-binding proteins. We show that Swi1 prevents telomere damage and maintains telomere length by protecting integrity of telomeric repeats. Swi1-mediated telomere maintenance is independent of telomerase activity, and loss of Swi1 causes hyper-activation of recombination-based telomere maintenance, which generates heterogeneous telomeres. Similar telomerase-independent and recombination-dependent mechanism is utilized by approximately 15% of human cancers, linking telomere replication defects with cancer development. Thus, our study may be relevant in understanding the role of telomere replication defects in the development of cancers in humans.

"Several sequence based genotyping schemes have been developed for Leptospira spp. The objective of this study was to genotype a collection of clinical and reference isolates using the two most commonly used schemes and compare and contrast the results.
A total of 48 isolates consisting of L. interrogans (n = 40) and L. kirschneri (n = 8) were typed by the 7 locus MLST scheme described by Thaipadungpanit et al., and the 6 locus genotyping scheme described by Ahmed et al., (termed 7L and 6L, respectively). Two L. interrogans isolates were not typed using 6L because of a deletion of three nucleotides in lipL32. The remaining 46 isolates were resolved into 21 sequence types (STs) by 7L, and 30 genotypes by 6L. Overall nucleotide diversity (based on concatenated sequence) was 3.6% and 2.3% for 7L and 6L, respectively. The D value (discriminatory ability) of 7L and 6L were comparable, i.e. 92.0 (95% CI 87.5–96.5) vs. 93.5 (95% CI 88.6–98.4). The dN/dS ratios calculated for each locus indicated that none were under positive selection. Neighbor joining trees were reconstructed based on the concatenated sequences for each scheme. Both trees showed two distinct groups corresponding to L. interrogans and L. kirschneri, and both identified two clones containing 10 and 7 clinical isolates, respectively. There were six instances in which 6L split single STs as defined by 7L into closely related clusters. We noted two discrepancies between the trees in which the genetic relatedness between two pairs of strains were more closely related by 7L than by 6L.
This genetic analysis indicates that the two schemes are comparable. We discuss their practical advantages and disadvantages.
","Two independent multilocus sequence based genotyping schemes (denoted here as 7L and 6L for schemes with 7 and 6 loci, respectively) are in use for Leptospira spp., which has led to uncertainty as to which should be adopted by the scientific community. The purpose of this study was to apply the two schemes to a single collection of pathogenic Leptospira, evaluate their performance, and describe the practical advantages and disadvantages of each scheme. We used a variety of phylogenetic approaches to compare the output data and found that the two schemes gave very similar results. 7L has the advantage that it is a conventional multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST) scheme based on housekeeping genes and is supported by a publically accessible database by which genotypes can be readily assigned as known or new sequence types by any investigator, but is currently only applicable to L. interrogans and L. kirschneri. Conversely, 6L can be applied to all pathogenic Leptospira spp., but is not a conventional MLST scheme by design and is not available online. 6L sequences from 271 strains have been released into the public domain, and phylogenetic analysis of new sequences using this scheme requires their download and offline analysis.

"The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) protein kinase, encoded by ORF36, functions to phosphorylate cellular and viral targets important in the KSHV lifecycle and to activate the anti-viral prodrug ganciclovir. Unlike the vast majority of mapped KSHV genes, no viral transcript has been identified with ORF36 positioned as the 5′-proximal gene. Here we report that ORF36 is robustly translated as a downstream cistron from the ORF35–37 polycistronic transcript in a cap-dependent manner. We identified two short, upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within the 5′ UTR of the polycistronic mRNA. While both uORFs function as negative regulators of ORF35, unexpectedly, the second allows for the translation of the downstream ORF36 gene by a termination-reinitiation mechanism. Positional conservation of uORFs within a number of related viruses suggests that this may be a common γ-herpesviral adaptation of a host translational regulatory mechanism.
","Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of multicentric Castleman's disease, primary effusion lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. KSHV expresses a number of transcripts with the potential to generate multiple proteins, yet relies on the cellular translation machinery that is primed to synthesize only one protein per mRNA. Here we report that the viral transcript encompassing ORF35–37 is able to direct synthesis of two proteins and that the translational switch is regulated by two short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the native 5′ untranslated region. uORFs are elements commonly found upstream of mammalian genes that function to interfere with unrestrained ribosomal scanning and thus repress translation of the major ORF. The sequence of the viral uORF appears unimportant, and instead functions to position the translation machinery in a location that favors translation of the downstream major ORF, via a reinitiation mechanism. Thus, KSHV uses a host strategy generally reserved to repress translation to instead allow for the expression of an internal gene.

"Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is the only active autonomous retrotransposon in the human genome. To investigate the interplay between the L1 retrotransposition machinery and the host cell, we used co-immunoprecipitation in conjunction with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to identify cellular proteins that interact with the L1 first open reading frame-encoded protein, ORF1p. We identified 39 ORF1p-interacting candidate proteins including the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP or ZC3HAV1). Here we show that the interaction between ZAP and ORF1p requires RNA and that ZAP overexpression in HeLa cells inhibits the retrotransposition of engineered human L1 and Alu elements, an engineered mouse L1, and an engineered zebrafish LINE-2 element. Consistently, siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous ZAP in HeLa cells led to a ~2-fold increase in human L1 retrotransposition. Fluorescence microscopy in cultured human cells demonstrated that ZAP co-localizes with L1 RNA, ORF1p, and stress granule associated proteins in cytoplasmic foci. Finally, molecular genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that ZAP reduces the accumulation of full-length L1 RNA and the L1-encoded proteins, yielding mechanistic insight about how ZAP may inhibit L1 retrotransposition. Together, these data suggest that ZAP inhibits the retrotransposition of LINE and Alu elements.
","Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is the only active autonomous retrotransposon in the human genome. L1s comprise ~17% of human DNA and it is estimated that an average human genome has ~80–100 active L1s. L1 moves throughout the genome via a “copy-and-paste” mechanism known as retrotransposition. L1 retrotransposition is known to cause mutations; thus, it stands to reason that the host cell has evolved mechanisms to protect the cell from unabated retrotransposition. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) inhibits the retrotransposition of human L1 and Alu retrotransposons, as well as related retrotransposons from mice and zebrafish. Biochemical and genetic data suggest that ZAP interacts with L1 RNA. Fluorescent microscopy demonstrates that ZAP associates with L1 in cytoplasmic foci that co-localize with stress granule proteins. Mechanistic analyses suggest that ZAP reduces the expression of full-length L1 RNA and the L1-encoded proteins, thereby providing mechanistic insight for how ZAP may restricts retrotransposition. Importantly, these data suggest that ZAP initially may have evolved to combat endogenous retrotransposons and subsequently was co-opted as a viral restriction factor.

"How tightly packed chromatin is thoroughly inspected for DNA damage is one of the fundamental unanswered questions in biology. In particular, the effective excision of carcinogenic lesions caused by the ultraviolet (UV) radiation of sunlight depends on UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB), but the mechanism by which this DDB1-DDB2 heterodimer stimulates DNA repair remained enigmatic. We hypothesized that a distinctive function of this unique sensor is to coordinate damage recognition in the nucleosome repeat landscape of chromatin. Therefore, the nucleosomes of human cells have been dissected by micrococcal nuclease, thus revealing, to our knowledge for the first time, that UV-DDB associates preferentially with lesions in hypersensitive, hence, highly accessible internucleosomal sites joining the core particles. Surprisingly, the accompanying CUL4A ubiquitin ligase activity is necessary to retain the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) partner at such internucleosomal repair hotspots that undergo very fast excision kinetics. This CUL4A complex thereby counteracts an unexpected affinity of XPC for core particles that are less permissive than hypersensitive sites to downstream repair subunits. That UV-DDB also adopts a ubiquitin-independent function is evidenced by domain mapping and in situ protein dynamics studies, revealing direct but transient interactions that promote a thermodynamically unfavorable β-hairpin insertion of XPC into substrate DNA. We conclude that the evolutionary advent of UV-DDB correlates with the need for a spatiotemporal organizer of XPC positioning in higher eukaryotic chromatin.
","Like all molecules in living organisms, DNA undergoes spontaneous decay and is constantly under attack by endogenous and environmental agents. Unlike other molecules, however, DNA—the blueprint of heredity—cannot be re-created de novo; it can only be copied. The original blueprint must therefore remain pristine. All kinds of DNA damage pose a health hazard. DNA lesions induced by the ultraviolet (UV) component of sunlight, for example, can lead to skin aging and skin cancer. A repair process known as nucleotide excision repair (NER) is dedicated to correcting this UV damage. Although the enzymatic steps of this repair process are known in detail, we still do not understand how it copes with the native situation in the cell, where the DNA is tightly wrapped around protein spools called nucleosomes. Our study has revealed the molecular mechanism by which an enigmatic component of NER called UV-DDB stimulates excision of UV-induced lesions in the landscape of nucleosome-packaged DNA in human skin cells. In particular, we describe how this accessory protein prioritizes, in space and time, which UV lesions in packaged DNA to target for repair by NER complexes, thus optimizing the repair process.

"Push–pull networks, in which two antagonistic enzymes control the
                    activity of a messenger protein, are ubiquitous in signal transduction pathways.
                    A classical example is the chemotaxis system of the bacterium
                        Escherichia coli, in which the kinase CheA and the
                    phosphatase CheZ regulate the phosphorylation level of the messenger protein
                    CheY. Recent experiments suggest that both the kinase and the phosphatase are
                    localized at the receptor cluster, and Vaknin and Berg recently demonstrated
                    that the spatial distribution of the phosphatase can markedly affect the
                    dose–response curves. We argue, using mathematical modeling, that the
                    canonical model of the chemotaxis network cannot explain the experimental
                    observations of Vaknin and Berg. We present a new model, in which a small
                    fraction of the phosphatase is localized at the receptor cluster, while the
                    remainder freely diffuses in the cytoplasm; moreover, the phosphatase at the
                    cluster has a higher binding affinity for the messenger protein and a higher
                    catalytic activity than the phosphatase in the cytoplasm. This model is
                    consistent with a large body of experimental data and can explain many of the
                    experimental observations of Vaknin and Berg. More generally, the combination of
                    differential affinity and catalytic activity provides a generic mechanism for
                    amplifying signals that could be exploited in other two-component signaling
                    systems. If this model is correct, then a number of recent modeling studies,
                    which aim to explain the chemotactic gain in terms of the activity of the
                    receptor cluster, should be reconsidered.
","In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, extra- and intracellular signals are often
                    processed by biochemical networks in which two enzymes together control the
                    activity of a messenger protein via opposite modification reactions. A
                    well-known example is the chemotaxis network of Escherichia
                    coli that controls the swimming behavior of the bacterium in response
                    to chemical stimuli. Recent experiments suggest that the two counteracting
                    enzymes in this network are colocalized at the receptor cluster, while
                    experiments by Vaknin and Berg indicate that the spatial distribution of the
                    enzymes by itself can markedly affect the response of the network. We argue
                    using mathematical modeling that the most widely used model of the chemotaxis
                    network is inconsistent with these experimental observations. We then present an
                    alternative model in which part of one enzyme is colocalized with the other
                    enzyme at the receptor cluster, while the remainder freely diffuses in the
                    cytoplasm; moreover, the fraction at the cluster both binds more strongly to the
                    messenger protein and modifies it faster. This model is consistent with a large
                    number of experimental observations and provides a generic mechanism for
                    amplifying signals.

"Envenoming by coral snakes (Elapidae: Micrurus), although not abundant, represent a serious health threat in the Americas, especially because antivenoms are scarce. The development of adequate amounts of antielapidic serum for the treatment of accidents caused by snakes like Micrurus corallinus is a challenging task due to characteristics such as low venom yield, fossorial habit, relatively small sizes and ophiophagous diet. These features make it difficult to capture and keep these snakes in captivity for venom collection. Furthermore, there are reports of antivenom scarcity in USA, leading to an increase in morbidity and mortality, with patients needing to be intubated and ventilated while the toxin wears off. The development of an alternative method for the production of an antielapidic serum, with no need for snake collection and maintenance in captivity, would be a plausible solution for the antielapidic serum shortage.
In this work we describe the mapping, by the SPOT-synthesis technique, of potential B-cell epitopes from five putative toxins from M. corallinus, which were used to design two multiepitope DNA strings for the genetic immunisation of female BALB/c mice. Results demonstrate that sera obtained from animals that were genetically immunised with these multiepitope constructs, followed by booster doses of recombinant proteins lead to a 60% survival in a lethal dose neutralisation assay.
Here we describe that the genetic immunisation with a synthetic multiepitope gene followed by booster doses with recombinant protein is a promising approach to develop an alternative antielapidic serum against M. corallinus venom without the need of collection and the very challenging maintenance of these snakes in captivity.
","Coral snakes are a group of deadly venomous snakes that exhibit a characteristic red, yellow/white, and black coloured banding pattern. Accidents involving these snakes tend to be very severe or even lethal, causing peripheral nervous system depression with muscle paralysis and vasomotor instability. The only acceptable medical treatment for snakebite accidents is the administration of an antivenom, generally produced by immunising horses with the snake venom. Nonetheless, for what concerns the antielapidic serum production in Brazil, the total amount of venom available for horse immunisations is insufficient. This is mainly due to the small size of coral snake glands, their underground life style, combined with its very low survival rates in captivity. Moreover, cases of patients being intubated and ventilated as a consequence of antivenom shortage in USA have also been registered. In this work, we present an alternative method for the development of antielapidic serum, which does not rely upon snake capture. This serum was produced by a heterologous DNA prime—with a multiepitope DNA string coding for the most reactive epitopes from the most abundant toxins of M. corallinus, a coral snake which occupy highly populated areas in Brazil—followed by recombinant multiepitope protein boost immunisation of mice.

"Every year, ovarian cancer kills approximately 14,000 women in the United States and more than 140,000 women worldwide. Most of these deaths are caused by tumors of the serous histological type, which is rarely diagnosed before it has disseminated. By deep paired-end sequencing of mRNA from serous ovarian cancers, followed by deep sequencing of the corresponding genomic region, we identified a recurrent fusion transcript. The fusion transcript joins the 5′ exons of ESRRA, encoding a ligand-independent member of the nuclear-hormone receptor superfamily, to the 3′ exons of C11orf20, a conserved but uncharacterized gene located immediately upstream of ESRRA in the reference genome. To estimate the prevalence of the fusion, we tested 67 cases of serous ovarian cancer by RT-PCR and sequencing and confirmed its presence in 10 of these. Targeted resequencing of the corresponding genomic region from two fusion-positive tumor samples identified a nearly clonal chromosomal rearrangement positioning ESRRA upstream of C11orf20 in one tumor, and evidence of local copy number variation in the ESRRA locus in the second tumor. We hypothesize that the recurrent novel fusion transcript may play a role in pathogenesis of a substantial fraction of serous ovarian cancers and could provide a molecular marker for detection of the cancer. Gene fusions involving adjacent or nearby genes can readily escape detection but may play important roles in the development and progression of cancer.
","Serous ovarian cancer, the most common form of ovarian cancer, is especially lethal because it is usually only detected at a late stage in its progression, after the cancer has spread to other tissues. We searched for molecular markers of this cancer that might provide a better way to detect tumors at a curable stage and that might provide targets for new treatments. Chromosomal rearrangements that fuse two genes to produce a recombinant gene that enhances growth or spread of the cancer are particularly specific biomarkers and have been found in many cancers. By “deep” sequencing of the RNA molecules that carry genetic information in serous ovarian cancers, we discovered a rearrangement that fuses the same two neighboring genes in at least 15% of these tumors. The two fused genes are ESRRA, which encodes a key regulator of gene expression, and an essentially uncharacterized gene, C11orf20, that is normally adjacent to the ESRRA gene. Chromosomal rearrangements that recombine parts of two nearby genes or even parts of a single gene may be a common, important feature of the cancer genome that eludes detection by most approaches to characterizing cancer genomes.

"In a previous paper we have shown that, when DNA samples for cases and controls are prepared in different laboratories prior to high-throughput genotyping, scoring inaccuracies can lead to differential misclassification and, consequently, to increased false-positive rates. Different DNA sourcing is often unavoidable in large-scale disease association studies of multiple case and control sets. Here, we describe methodological improvements to minimise such biases. These fall into two categories: improvements to the basic clustering methods for identifying genotypes from fluorescence intensities, and use of “fuzzy” calls in association tests in order to make appropriate allowance for call uncertainty. We find that the main improvement is a modification of the calling algorithm that links the clustering of cases and controls while allowing for different DNA sourcing. We also find that, in the presence of different DNA sourcing, biases associated with missing data can increase the false-positive rate. Therefore, we propose the use of “fuzzy” calls to deal with uncertain genotypes that would otherwise be labeled as missing.
","Genome-wide disease association studies are becoming more common and involve genotyping cases and controls at a large number of SNP markers spread throughout the genome. We have shown previously that such studies can have an inflated false-positive rate, the result of genotype calling inaccuracies when DNA samples for cases and controls were prepared in different laboratories, prior to genotyping. Different DNA sourcing is often unavoidable in the large-scale association studies of multiple case and control sets. Here we describe methodological improvements to minimise such biases. These fall into two categories: improvements to the basic clustering methods for calling genotypes from fluorescence intensities, and use of “fuzzy” calls in association tests in order to make appropriate allowance for call uncertainty.

"CENP-A (CID in flies) is the histone H3 variant essential for centromere specification, kinetochore formation, and chromosome segregation during cell division. Recent studies have elucidated major cell cycle mechanisms and factors critical for CENP-A incorporation in mitosis, predominantly in cultured cells. However, we do not understand the roles, regulation, and cell cycle timing of CENP-A assembly in somatic tissues in multicellular organisms and in meiosis, the specialized cell division cycle that gives rise to haploid gametes. Here we investigate the timing and requirements for CID assembly in mitotic tissues and male and female meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster, using fixed and live imaging combined with genetic approaches. We find that CID assembly initiates at late telophase and continues during G1 phase in somatic tissues in the organism, later than the metaphase assembly observed in cultured cells. Furthermore, CID assembly occurs at two distinct cell cycle phases during male meiosis: prophase of meiosis I and after exit from meiosis II, in spermatids. CID assembly in prophase I is also conserved in female meiosis. Interestingly, we observe a novel decrease in CID levels after the end of meiosis I and before meiosis II, which correlates temporally with changes in kinetochore organization and orientation. We also demonstrate that CID is retained on mature sperm despite the gross chromatin remodeling that occurs during protamine exchange. Finally, we show that the centromere proteins CAL1 and CENP-C are both required for CID assembly in meiosis and normal progression through spermatogenesis. We conclude that the cell cycle timing of CID assembly in meiosis is different from mitosis and that the efficient propagation of CID through meiotic divisions and on sperm is likely to be important for centromere specification in the developing zygote.
","Centromeres are regions of eukaryotic chromosomes that recruit the kinetochores and are essential for faithful segregation of DNA during all cell divisions. The centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A accumulates at the centromere, defining this region, and is maintained throughout cellular generations by epigenetic mechanisms in most eukaryotes. Previous studies have discovered many factors regulating both the maintenance and assembly of CENP-A at centromeres during mitosis in cultured cells, but the mode of regulation of CENP-A assembly during meiosis and mitosis in animal tissues is unknown. In this study, we use Drosophila melanogaster as an organismal model to investigate the timing and requirements for assembly of CID, the fly CENP-A homolog. We find that that CID is loaded at centromeres during telophase/G1 phase in brain stem and nonstem cells. In male meiosis, CID is loaded in two phases, during the first stages of meiosis I and after the second meiotic division. Meiosis I loading time is also conserved in females. We also report an unprecedented drop in CID levels after meiosis I and before meiosis II, which correlates with the timing of kinetochore reorientation. Additionally, we find that two essential centromere proteins (CAL1 and CENP-C) are necessary for CID assembly and chromosome segregation during meiosis. Our data demonstrate novel differential timing for CENP-A assembly during mitosis and meiosis in the whole organism.

"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an important pathogen that causes food-borne gastroenteritis in humans. The type III secretion system encoded on chromosome 2 (T3SS2) plays a critical role in the enterotoxic activity of V. parahaemolyticus. Previous studies have demonstrated that T3SS2 induces actin stress fibers in various epithelial cell lines during infection. This stress fiber formation is strongly related to pathogenicity, but the mechanisms that underlie T3SS2-dependent actin stress fiber formation and the main effector have not been elucidated. In this study, we identified VopO as a critical T3SS2 effector protein that activates the RhoA-ROCK pathway, which is an essential pathway for the induction of the T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation. We also determined that GEF-H1, a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), directly binds VopO and is necessary for T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation. The GEF-H1-binding activity of VopO via an alpha helix region correlated well with its stress fiber-inducing capacity. Furthermore, we showed that VopO is involved in the T3SS2-dependent disruption of the epithelial barrier. Thus, VopO hijacks the RhoA-ROCK pathway in a different manner compared with previously reported bacterial toxins and effectors that modulate the Rho GTPase signaling pathway.
","Many bacterial pathogens manipulate the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells to establish pathogenesis via invasion, to evade killing by phagocytes, to disrupt a barrier function, and to induce inflammation caused by translocation type III secretion (T3S) effector proteins. We demonstrated that the T3S effector protein (VopO) of the enteric pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus induced robust actin stress fiber formation in infected host cells. Furthermore, this actin rearrangement induced barrier disruption in a colon epithelial cell line. Although many types of effector proteins have been reported, VopO does not share homology with previously reported effector proteins, and no putative functional motifs could be identified. Finally, we determined that the direct binding of VopO to a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) is a key step in the induction of stress fiber formation. These findings indicate that VopO plays a unique role in the pathogenicity of V. parahaemolyticus.

"Innate immune restriction factors represent important specialized barriers to zoonotic transmission of viruses. Significant consideration has been given to their possible use for therapeutic benefit. The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3) family of cytidine deaminases are potent immune defense molecules capable of efficiently restricting endogenous retroelements as well as a broad range of viruses including Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human Papilloma virus (HPV), and Human T Cell Leukemia virus (HTLV). The best characterized members of this family are APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) and their restriction of HIV. HIV has evolved to counteract these powerful restriction factors by encoding an accessory gene designated viral infectivity factor (vif). Here we demonstrate that APOBEC3 efficiently restricts CCR5-tropic HIV in the absence of Vif. However, our results also show that CXCR4-tropic HIV can escape from APOBEC3 restriction and replicate in vivo independent of Vif. Molecular analysis identified thymocytes as cells with reduced A3G and A3F expression. Direct injection of vif-defective HIV into the thymus resulted in viral replication and dissemination detected by plasma viral load analysis; however, vif-defective viruses remained sensitive to APOBEC3 restriction as extensive G to A mutation was observed in proviral DNA recovered from other organs. Remarkably, HIV replication persisted despite the inability of HIV to develop resistance to APOBEC3 in the absence of Vif. Our results provide novel insight into a highly specific subset of cells that potentially circumvent the action of APOBEC3; however our results also demonstrate the massive inactivation of CCR5-tropic HIV in the absence of Vif.
","The APOBEC3 family of proteins is a potent cellular defense mechanism capable of restricting a broad range of viruses including HIV. HIV requires a critical accessory protein, Vif, which targets APOBEC3 for degradation thereby shielding its genome from lethal mutagenesis. Previous in vitro studies have shown that in the absence of Vif, HIV can be hypermutated by APOBEC3. This potent restrictive function of APOBEC3 has generated strong interest in developing therapeutics based on the APOBEC3/Vif axis. Here we demonstrate in vivo that CCR5-tropic HIV can be efficiently restricted by APOBEC3. However, our results also show that CXCR4-tropic HIV can replicate independent of Vif and escape lethal restriction by APOBEC3. Specifically, we show that thymocytes have reduced expression of A3G and A3F and that direct injection of vif-defective HIV into the thymus results in viral replication and dissemination. Despite continued Vif-independent HIV replication, the virus remained sensitive to APOBEC3 mutagenesis and was rapidly restricted in tissues with higher A3G and A3F expression. Our results provide novel insight into the restriction of HIV in vivo and identify a potentially significant defect in the innate immune defenses that protect the host cell from pathogens.

"Pure populations of quiescent yeast can be obtained from stationary phase cultures that have ceased proliferation after exhausting glucose and other carbon sources from their environment. They are uniformly arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and display very high thermo-tolerance and longevity. We find that G1 arrest is initiated before all the glucose has been scavenged from the media. Maintaining G1 arrest requires transcriptional repression of the G1 cyclin, CLN3, by Xbp1. Xbp1 is induced as glucose is depleted and it is among the most abundant transcripts in quiescent cells. Xbp1 binds and represses CLN3 transcription and in the absence of Xbp1, or with extra copies of CLN3, cells undergo ectopic divisions and produce very small cells. The Rad53-mediated replication stress checkpoint reinforces the arrest and becomes essential when Cln3 is overproduced. The XBP1 transcript also undergoes metabolic oscillations under glucose limitation and we identified many additional transcripts that oscillate out of phase with XBP1 and have Xbp1 binding sites in their promoters. Further global analysis revealed that Xbp1 represses 15% of all yeast genes as they enter the quiescent state and over 500 of these transcripts contain Xbp1 binding sites in their promoters. Xbp1-repressed transcripts are highly enriched for genes involved in the regulation of cell growth, cell division and metabolism. Failure to repress some or all of these targets leads xbp1 cells to enter a permanent arrest or senescence with a shortened lifespan.
","Complex organisms depend on populations of non-dividing quiescent cells for their controlled growth, development and tissue renewal. These quiescent cells are maintained in a resting state, and divide only when stimulated to do so. Unscheduled exit or failure to enter this quiescent state results in uncontrolled proliferation and cancer. Yeast cells also enter a stable, protected and reversible quiescent state. As with higher cells, they exit the cell cycle from G1, reduce growth, conserve and recycle cellular contents. These similarities, and the fact that the mechanisms that start and stop the cell cycle are fundamentally conserved lead us to think that understanding how yeast enter, maintain and reverse quiescence could give important leads into the same processes in complex organisms. We show that yeast cells maintain G1 arrest by expressing a transcription factor that represses conserved activators (cyclins) and hundreds of other genes that are important for cell division and cell growth. Failure to repress some or all of these targets leads to extra cell divisions, prevents reversible arrest and shortens life span. Many Xbp1 targets are conserved cell cycle regulators and may also be actively repressed in the quiescent cells of more complex organisms.

"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants have been traditionally used as markers to trace ancient population migrations. Although experiments relying on model organisms and cytoplasmic hybrids, as well as disease association studies, have served to underline the functionality of certain mtDNA SNPs, only little is known of the regulatory impact of ancient mtDNA variants, especially in terms of gene expression. By analyzing RNA-seq data of 454 lymphoblast cell lines from the 1000 Genomes Project, we found that mtDNA variants defining the most common African genetic background, the L haplogroup, exhibit a distinct overall mtDNA gene expression pattern, which was independent of mtDNA copy numbers. Secondly, intra-population analysis revealed subtle, yet significant, expression differences in four tRNA genes. Strikingly, the more prominent African mtDNA gene expression pattern best correlated with the expression of nuclear DNA-encoded RNA-binding proteins, and with SNPs within the mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins PTCD1 and MRPS7. Our results thus support the concept of an ancient regulatory transition of mtDNA-encoded genes as humans left Africa to populate the rest of the world.
","The mitochondrion is an organelle found in all cells of our body and plays a significant role in the energy and heat production. This is the only organelle in animal cells harboring its own genome outside of the nucleus. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants have been traditionally used as neutral markers to trace ancient population migrations. As a result, the functional impact of human mtDNA population variants on gene regulation is poorly understood. To address this question, we analyzed available data of mtDNA gene expression pattern in a large group of individuals (454) from diverse human populations. Here, we show for the first time that the ancient migration of humans out of Africa correlated with differences in mitochondrial gene expression patterns, and could be explained by the activity of certain RNA-binding proteins. These findings suggest a major mitochondrial regulatory transition, as humans left Africa to populate the rest of the world.

"ChIP-based genome-wide assays of transcription factor (TF) occupancy have emerged as a powerful, high-throughput method to understand transcriptional regulation, especially on a global scale. This has led to great interest in the underlying biochemical mechanisms that direct TF-DNA binding, with the ultimate goal of computationally predicting a TF's occupancy profile in any cellular condition. In this study, we examined the influence of various potential determinants of TF-DNA binding on a much larger scale than previously undertaken. We used a thermodynamics-based model of TF-DNA binding, called “STAP,” to analyze 45 TF-ChIP data sets from Drosophila embryonic development. We built a cross-validation framework that compares a baseline model, based on the ChIP'ed (“primary”) TF's motif, to more complex models where binding by secondary TFs is hypothesized to influence the primary TF's occupancy. Candidates interacting TFs were chosen based on RNA-SEQ expression data from the time point of the ChIP experiment. We found widespread evidence of both cooperative and antagonistic effects by secondary TFs, and explicitly quantified these effects. We were able to identify multiple classes of interactions, including (1) long-range interactions between primary and secondary motifs (separated by ≤150 bp), suggestive of indirect effects such as chromatin remodeling, (2) short-range interactions with specific inter-site spacing biases, suggestive of direct physical interactions, and (3) overlapping binding sites suggesting competitive binding. Furthermore, by factoring out the previously reported strong correlation between TF occupancy and DNA accessibility, we were able to categorize the effects into those that are likely to be mediated by the secondary TF's effect on local accessibility and those that utilize accessibility-independent mechanisms. Finally, we conducted in vitro pull-down assays to test model-based predictions of short-range cooperative interactions, and found that seven of the eight TF pairs tested physically interact and that some of these interactions mediate cooperative binding to DNA.
","Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based genome-wide assays of transcription factor (TF) occupancy have emerged as a powerful, high throughput method to understand transcriptional regulation, especially on a global scale. Here, we utilize 45 ChIP-chip and ChIP-SEQ data sets from Drosophila to explore the underlying mechanisms of TF-DNA binding. For this, we employ a biophysically motivated computational model, in conjunction with over 300 TF motifs (binding specificities) as well as gene expression and DNA accessibility data from different developmental stages in Drosophila embryos. Our findings provide robust statistical evidence of the role played by TF-TF interactions in shaping genome-wide TF-DNA binding profiles, and thus in directing gene regulation. Our method allows us to go beyond simply recognizing the existence of such interactions, to quantifying their effects on TF occupancy. We are able to categorize the probable mechanisms of these effects as involving direct physical interactions versus accessibility-mediated indirect interactions, long-range versus short-range interactions, and cooperative versus antagonistic interactions. Our analysis reveals widespread evidence of combinatorial regulation present in recently generated ChIP data sets, and sets the stage for rich integrative models of the future that will predict cell type-specific TF occupancy values from sequence and expression data.

"Aberrant DNA methylation is an important cancer hallmark, yet the dynamics of DNA methylation changes in human carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored. Moreover, the role of DNA methylation for prediction of clinical outcome is still uncertain and confined to specific cancers. Here we perform the most comprehensive study of DNA methylation changes throughout human carcinogenesis, analysing 27,578 CpGs in each of 1,475 samples, ranging from normal cells in advance of non-invasive neoplastic transformation to non-invasive and invasive cancers and metastatic tissue. We demonstrate that hypermethylation at stem cell PolyComb Group Target genes (PCGTs) occurs in cytologically normal cells three years in advance of the first morphological neoplastic changes, while hypomethylation occurs preferentially at CpGs which are heavily Methylated in Embryonic Stem Cells (MESCs) and increases significantly with cancer invasion in both the epithelial and stromal tumour compartments. In contrast to PCGT hypermethylation, MESC hypomethylation progresses significantly from primary to metastatic cancer and defines a poor prognostic signature in four different gynaecological cancers. Finally, we associate expression of TET enzymes, which are involved in active DNA demethylation, to MESC hypomethylation in cancer. These findings have major implications for cancer and embryonic stem cell biology and establish the importance of systemic DNA hypomethylation for predicting prognosis in a wide range of different cancers.
","DNA methylation is an important chemical modification of DNA that can affect and regulate the activity of genes in human tissue. Abnormal DNA methylation and its subsequent effects on gene activity are a hallmark of cancer, yet when precisely these DNA methylation changes occur and how they contribute to the development of cancer remains largely unexplored. In this work we measure the methylation state of DNA at over 14,000 genes in over 1,475 samples, including normal and benign cells, invasive cancers, and metastatic cancer tissue. Using cervical cancer as a model, we show that gain of abnormal methylation at genes typically un-methylated in stem cells can be detected up to 3 years in advance of the appearance of pre-cancerous cells, while those genes typically methylated in stem cells lose this methylation progressively throughout cancer development. Furthermore, we discover that this process of methylation loss during cancer progression is a marker of poor disease outcome common to all four major women-specific cancers: breast, ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers. Finally we demonstrate the relationship between loss of methylation and cancer-specific over-production of a specific protein known to play an active role in removing methylation from DNA. Taken together these findings highlight the complex nature of DNA methylation dynamics in cancer development as well as their potential exploitation for clinical gain.

"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates multiple aspects of metazoan development and tissue homeostasis, and is constitutively active in numerous cancers. We identified Ubr3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a novel, positive regulator of Hh signaling in Drosophila and vertebrates. Hh signaling regulates the Ubr3-mediated poly-ubiquitination and degradation of Cos2, a central component of Hh signaling. In developing Drosophila eye discs, loss of ubr3 leads to a delayed differentiation of photoreceptors and a reduction in Hh signaling. In zebrafish, loss of Ubr3 causes a decrease in Shh signaling in the developing eyes, somites, and sensory neurons. However, not all tissues that require Hh signaling are affected in zebrafish. Mouse UBR3 poly-ubiquitinates Kif7, the mammalian homologue of Cos2. Finally, loss of UBR3 up-regulates Kif7 protein levels and decreases Hh signaling in cultured cells. In summary, our work identifies Ubr3 as a novel, evolutionarily conserved modulator of Hh signaling that boosts Hh in some tissues.
","Hedgehog signaling regulates many important biological processes and has been linked to developmental disorders, wound healing, and cancer. Although the major components in the pathway have been well studied in Drosophila and vertebrates, how the signaling is regulated by different modulators is not well understood. Here, we take advantage of a fly forward genetic screen to isolate Ubr3. We show that it is a novel modulator that regulates Hh signaling. Loss of ubr3 leads to Hh signaling defects in developing eyes of Drosophila, and affects eye, and somite and sensory neuron development in zebrafish. However, Hh signaling is not affected in all cells known to be dependent on Hh signaling as loss of ubr3 in the fly wing and zebrafish inner ear are not affected. This suggests that Ubr3 is a modulator that is only required in some Hh dependent organs/cells. We have shown that Ubr3 down-regulates the levels of Cos2 and its mammalian homolog Kif7, key negative regulators of Hh signaling, through poly-ubiquitination. The poly-ubiquitination of Cos2 by Ubr3 is enhanced by Hh activation, suggesting that it functions in a positive feedback that modulates Hh activation.

"Functional studies will facilitate characterization of role and essentiality of newly available genome sequences of the human schistosomes, Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum and S. haematobium. To develop transgenesis as a functional approach for these pathogens, we previously demonstrated that pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV) can transduce schistosomes leading to chromosomal integration of reporter transgenes and short hairpin RNA cassettes. Here we investigated vertical transmission of transgenes through the developmental cycle of S. mansoni after introducing transgenes into eggs. Although MLV infection of schistosome eggs from mouse livers was efficient in terms of snail infectivity, >10-fold higher transgene copy numbers were detected in cercariae derived from in vitro laid eggs (IVLE). After infecting snails with miracidia from eggs transduced by MLV, sequencing of genomic DNA from cercariae released from the snails also revealed the presence of transgenes, demonstrating that transgenes had been transmitted through the asexual developmental cycle, and thereby confirming germline transgenesis. High-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA from schistosome populations exposed to MLV mapped widespread and random insertion of transgenes throughout the genome, along each of the autosomes and sex chromosomes, validating the utility of this approach for insertional mutagenesis. In addition, the germline-transmitted transgene encoding neomycin phosphotransferase rescued cultured schistosomules from toxicity of the antibiotic G418, and PCR analysis of eggs resulting from sexual reproduction of the transgenic worms in mice confirmed that retroviral transgenes were transmitted to the next (F1) generation. These findings provide the first description of wide-scale, random insertional mutagenesis of chromosomes and of germline transmission of a transgene in schistosomes. Transgenic lines of schistosomes expressing antibiotic resistance could advance functional genomics for these significant human pathogens.
Sequence data from this study have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl) under accession number ERP000379.
","Schistosomes, or blood flukes, are responsible for the major neglected tropical disease called schistosomiasis, which afflicts over 200 million people in impoverished regions of the developing world. The genome sequence of these parasites has been decoded. Integration sites of retroviral transgenes into the chromosomes of schistosomes were investigated by high-throughput sequencing. Transgene integrations were mapped to the genome sequence of Schistosoma mansoni. Integrations were distributed apparently randomly across each of the eight chromosomes, including the seven autosomes and the sex chromosomes Z and W. Integration events of transgenes were characterized in chromosomes of cercariae that were progeny of schistosome eggs infected with pseudotyped virions. Also, transgenic cercariae were employed to infect mice and transgenes were detected in the F1 eggs. Together these findings confirmed vertical transmission of transgenes through the schistosome germline, through both the asexual and the sexual reproductive phases of the developmental cycle. Moreover, germline-transmitted retroviral transgenes encoding drug resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotics allowed schistosomes to survive toxic concentrations of the antibiotic G418. These findings represent the first reports of wide-scale insertional mutagenesis of schistosome chromosomes and vertical transmission of a transgene through the schistosome germline.

"The objectives of this work were the classification of dynamic metabolic biomarker candidates and the modeling and characterization of kinetic regulatory mechanisms in human metabolism with response to external perturbations by physical activity. Longitudinal metabolic concentration data of 47 individuals from 4 different groups were examined, obtained from a cycle ergometry cohort study. In total, 110 metabolites (within the classes of acylcarnitines, amino acids, and sugars) were measured through a targeted metabolomics approach, combining tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with the concept of stable isotope dilution (SID) for metabolite quantitation. Biomarker candidates were selected by combined analysis of maximum fold changes (MFCs) in concentrations and P-values resulting from statistical hypothesis testing. Characteristic kinetic signatures were identified through a mathematical modeling approach utilizing polynomial fitting. Modeled kinetic signatures were analyzed for groups with similar behavior by applying hierarchical cluster analysis. Kinetic shape templates were characterized, defining different forms of basic kinetic response patterns, such as sustained, early, late, and other forms, that can be used for metabolite classification. Acetylcarnitine (C2), showing a late response pattern and having the highest values in MFC and statistical significance, was classified as late marker and ranked as strong predictor (MFC = 1.97, P < 0.001). In the class of amino acids, highest values were shown for alanine (MFC = 1.42, P < 0.001), classified as late marker and strong predictor. Glucose yields a delayed response pattern, similar to a hockey stick function, being classified as delayed marker and ranked as moderate predictor (MFC = 1.32, P < 0.001). These findings coincide with existing knowledge on central metabolic pathways affected in exercise physiology, such as β-oxidation of fatty acids, glycolysis, and glycogenolysis. The presented modeling approach demonstrates high potential for dynamic biomarker identification and the investigation of kinetic mechanisms in disease or pharmacodynamics studies using MS data from longitudinal cohort studies.
","Human metabolism is controlled through basic kinetic regulatory mechanisms, where the overall system aims to maintain a state of homeostasis.

In total, 110 metabolites measured from blood samples of 47 individuals were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Dynamic biomarker candidates could be selected based on the amplitudes of changes in metabolite concentrations and the significance of statistical hypothesis testing. We were able to characterize specific kinetic patterns for groups of similarly behaving metabolites.

"The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) double-stranded DNA genome is reverse transcribed from its RNA pregenome (pgRNA) within the virus core (or capsid). Phosphorylation of the arginine-rich carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the HBV capsid protein (Cp183) is essential for pgRNA encapsidation and reverse transcription. However, the structure of the CTD remains poorly defined. Here we report sub-nanometer resolution cryo-EM structures of in vitro assembled empty and pgRNA-filled Cp183 capsids in unphosphorylated and phosphorylation-mimic states. In empty capsids, we found unexpected evidence of surface accessible CTD density partially occluding pores in the capsid surface. We also observed that CTD organization changed substantively as a function of phosphorylation. In RNA-filled capsids, unphosphorylated CTDs favored thick ropes of RNA, while the phosphorylation-mimic favored a mesh of thin, high-density strands suggestive of single stranded RNA. These results demonstrate that the CTD can regulate nucleic acid structure, supporting the hypothesis that the HBV capsid has a functional role as a nucleic acid chaperone.
","Many single stranded RNA virus encapsidate their genome through positively-charged domains of their capsid proteins. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a double stranded DNA virus which packages a single-stranded RNA pregenome (pgRNA) that is reverse transcribed within the capsid. RNA packaging requires a phosphorylated form of the HBV capsid protein's RNA-binding carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Although the capsid has been well studied, the internal structures, the CTDs and the packaged RNA, are poorly characterized. By using in vitro reassembly, we have generated empty and pgRNA-filled capsids using phosphorylation-mimic and unphosphorylated forms of the capsid protein. Using cryo-EM image reconstruction, we have been able to show the structure of encapsidated pgRNA and, independently, the CTD in the absence of RNA to visualize early stages of the HBV assembly. We showed that the structural organization of the CTD changes as a function of the phosphorylation. Changes in CTD structure affect the structure of the encapsidated pgRNA, changing it from thin segments of density in the phosphorylated state, suggestive of single-stranded RNA, to thick rope-like structures consistent with duplex nucleic acid in the unphosphorylated state.

"The acquisition of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor resistance by H5N1 influenza viruses has serious clinical implications, as this class of drugs can be an essential component of pandemic control measures. The continuous evolution of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses results in the emergence of natural NA gene variations whose impact on viral fitness and NA inhibitor susceptibility are poorly defined. We generated seven genetically stable recombinant clade 2.2 A/Turkey/15/06-like (H5N1) influenza viruses carrying NA mutations located either in the framework residues (E119A, H274Y, N294S) or in close proximity to the NA enzyme active site (V116A, I117V, K150N, Y252H). NA enzyme inhibition assays showed that NA mutations at positions 116, 117, 274, and 294 reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate (IC50s increased 5- to 940-fold). Importantly, the E119A NA mutation (previously reported to confer resistance in the N2 NA subtype) was stable in the clade 2.2 H5N1 virus background and induced cross-resistance to oseltamivir carboxylate and zanamivir. We demonstrated that Y252H NA mutation contributed for decreased susceptibility of clade 2.2 H5N1 viruses to oseltamivir carboxylate as compared to clade 1 viruses. The enzyme kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km and Ki) of the avian-like N1 NA glycoproteins were highly consistent with their IC50 values. None of the recombinant H5N1 viruses had attenuated virulence in ferrets inoculated with 106 EID50 dose. Most infected ferrets showed mild clinical disease signs that differed in duration. However, H5N1 viruses carrying the E119A or the N294S NA mutation were lethal to 1 of 3 inoculated animals and were associated with significantly higher virus titers (P<0.01) and inflammation in the lungs compared to the wild-type virus. Our results suggest that highly pathogenic H5N1 variants carrying mutations within the NA active site that decrease susceptibility to NA inhibitors may possess increased virulence in mammalian hosts compared to drug-sensitive viruses. There is a need for novel anti-influenza drugs that target different virus/host factors and can limit the emergence of resistance.
","Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses remain a potential pandemic threat. If vaccination is not available in the event of a pandemic, antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) will be crucial for disease control. However, the emergence of NA inhibitor–resistant virus mutations can significantly limit the effectiveness of treatment. We used reverse genetics techniques to study the impact of specific point mutations in the NA gene on the pathogenicity of clade 2.2 H5N1 influenza viruses in a ferret animal model. Seven recombinant H5N1 viruses (containing the mutations V116A, I117V, E119A, K150N, Y252H, H274Y, and N294S) were viable and genetically stable in MDCK cells. Three of the NA mutations were of particular significance: (1) E119A conferred resistance to both oseltamivir carboxylate and zanamivir and increased virus virulence in ferrets; (2) H274Y conferred a high level of resistance to oseltamivir carboxylate; and (3) N294S conferred moderate level of resistance to oseltamivir carboxylate and increased virus virulence in ferrets. Strategies to limit the emergence of drug resistance are urgently needed.

"Epigenetic variations of phenotypes, especially those associated with DNA methylation, are often inherited over multiple generations in plants. The active and inactive chromatin states are heritable and can be maintained or even be amplified by positive feedback in a transgenerational manner. However, mechanisms controlling the transgenerational DNA methylation dynamics are largely unknown. As an approach to understand the transgenerational dynamics, we examined long-term effect of impaired DNA methylation in Arabidopsis mutants of the chromatin remodeler gene DDM1 (Decrease in DNA Methylation 1) through whole genome DNA methylation sequencing. The ddm1 mutation induces a drastic decrease in DNA methylation of transposable elements (TEs) and repeats in the initial generation, while also inducing ectopic DNA methylation at hundreds of loci. Unexpectedly, this ectopic methylation can only be seen after repeated self-pollination. The ectopic cytosine methylation is found primarily in the non-CG context and starts from 3’ regions within transcription units and spreads upstream. Remarkably, when chromosomes with reduced DNA methylation were introduced from a ddm1 mutant into a DDM1 wild-type background, the ddm1-derived chromosomes also induced analogous de novo accumulation of DNA methylation in trans. These results lead us to propose a model to explain the transgenerational DNA methylation redistribution by genome-wide negative feedback. The global negative feedback, together with local positive feedback, would ensure robust and balanced differentiation of chromatin states within the genome.
","DNA methylation is important for controlling activity of transposable elements and genes. An intriguing feature of DNA methylation in plants is that its pattern can be inherited over multiple generations at high fidelity in a Mendelian manner. However, mechanisms controlling the trans-generational DNA methylation dynamics are largely unknown. Arabidopsis mutants of a chromatin remodeler gene DDM1 (Decrease in DNA Methylation 1) show drastic reduction of DNA methylation in transposons and repeats, and also show progressive changes in developmental phenotypes during propagation through self-pollination. We now show using whole genome DNA methylation sequencing that upon repeated selfing, the ddm1 mutation induces an ectopic accumulation of DNA methylation at hundreds of loci. Remarkably, even in the wild type background, the analogous de novo increase of DNA methylation can be induced in trans by chromosomes with reduced DNA methylation. Collectively, our findings support a model to explain the transgenerational DNA methylation redistribution by genome-wide negative feedback, which should be important for balanced differentiation of DNA methylation states within the genome.

"Tsetse (Glossina sensu stricto) are cyclical vectors of human and animal trypanosomoses, that are presently targeted by the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) coordinated by the African Union. In order to achieve effective control of tsetse, there is need to produce elaborate plans to guide intervention programmes. A model intended to aid in the planning of intervention programmes and assist a fuller understanding of tsetse distribution was applied, in a pilot study in the Masoka area, Mid-Zambezi valley in Zimbabwe, and targeting two savannah species, Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes.
The field study was conducted between March and December 2015 in 105 sites following a standardized grid sampling frame. Presence data were used to study habitat suitability of both species based on climatic and environmental data derived from MODIS and SPOT 5 satellite images. Factors influencing distribution were studied using an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) whilst habitat suitability was predicted using a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model at a spatial resolution of 250 m. Area Under the Curve (AUC), an indicator of model performance, was 0.89 for G. m. morsitans and 0.96 for G. pallidipes. We then used the predicted suitable areas to calculate the probability that flies were really absent from the grid cells where they were not captured during the study based on a probability model using a risk threshold of 0.05. Apart from grid cells where G. m. morsitans and G. pallidipes were captured, there was a high probability of presence in an additional 128 km2 and 144 km2 respectively.
The modelling process promised to be useful in optimizing the outputs of presence/absence surveys, allowing the definition of tsetse infested areas with improved accuracy. The methodology proposed here can be extended to all the tsetse infested parts of Zimbabwe and may also be useful for other PATTEC national initiatives in other African countries.
","Tse-tse flies are vectors of human and animal trypanosomoses, that are presently targeted by the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) coordinated by the African Union. In Zimbabwe, the government has devoted a full section of the veterinary services to tsetse and trypanosomosis control but the delimitation of tsetse infested areas, which is a pre-requisite to achieve effective control still requires improvement. Here we present a methodology that could help delimit target areas throughout the country, in a pilot study area located in the Masoka area, Mid-Zambezi valley in Zimbabwe, and targeting two savannah species, Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes. The study, which was carried out in preparation for a vector control campaign, allowed to discriminate areas where tsetse presence was certain, likely or unlikely Habitat degradation due to agricultural activities seemed to play a pivotal role in determining the infestation by tsetse since settled areas had low probabilities for both species which was expected in this group. Application of this model will help reduce the cost of delineating tsetse infested areas in other parts of Zimbabwe and may also be useful for other PATTEC national initiatives in other African countries at a time when funding for tsetse control programmes is reduced.

"Conflict between the sexes over reproductive interests can drive rapid evolution of reproductive traits and promote speciation. Here we show that inter-species mating between Caenorhabditis nematodes sterilizes maternal individuals. The principal effectors of male-induced harm are sperm cells, which induce sterility and shorten lifespan by displacing conspecific sperm, invading the ovary, and sometimes breaching the gonad to infiltrate other tissues. This sperm-mediated harm is pervasive across species, but idiosyncrasies in its magnitude implicate both independent histories of sexually antagonistic coevolution within species and differences in reproductive mode (self-fertilizing hermaphrodites versus females) in determining its severity. Consistent with this conclusion, in androdioecious species the hermaphrodites are more vulnerable, the males more benign, or both. Patterns of assortative mating and a low incidence of invasive sperm occurring with conspecific mating are indicative of ongoing intra-specific sexual conflict that results in inter-species reproductive incompatibility.
","The sexes have divergent reproductive interests, and conflict arising from this disparity can drive the rapid evolution of reproductive traits and promote speciation. Here we describe a unique reproductive barrier in Caenorhabditis nematodes that is induced by sperm. We found that mating between species can sterilize maternal worms and even cause premature death, and we were able to attribute this phenomenon directly to the sperm themselves. Sperm from other species can displace sperm from the same species and, in some cases, can invade inappropriate parts of the maternal reproductive system and even their non-reproductive tissues. We find that mating to males of another species harms females far more than does within-species mating. Overall, our observations are consistent with ongoing sexual conflict between the sexes within species, arising as a byproduct of sperm competition among the gametes of different males. Finally, patterns of assortative mating indicate that mating behaviours that reduce the likelihood of costly inter-species mating have evolved in this group of animals. These findings support an important role of sexual selection and gametic interactions contributing to reproductive boundaries between species, as predicted by evolutionary theory.

"The inability of Mycobacterium leprae to grow on axenic media has necessitated specialized techniques in order to determine viability of this organism. The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and sensitive molecular assay for determining M. leprae viability directly from infected tissues.
Two M. leprae-specific quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays based on the expression levels of esxA, encoding the ESAT-6 protein, and hsp18, encoding the heat shock 18 kDa protein, were developed and tested using infected footpad (FP) tissues of both immunocompetent and immunocompromised (athymic nu/nu) mice. In addition, the ability of these assays to detect the effects of anti-leprosy drug treatment on M. leprae viability was determined using rifampin and rifapentine, each at 10 mg/kg for 1, 5, or 20 daily doses, in the athymic nu/nu FP model. Molecular enumeration (RLEP PCR) and viability determinations (qRT-PCR) were performed via Taqman methodology on DNA and RNA, respectively, purified from ethanol-fixed FP tissue and compared with conventional enumeration (microscopic counting of acid fast bacilli) and viability assays (radiorespirometry, viability staining) which utilized bacilli freshly harvested from the contralateral FP. Both molecular and conventional assays demonstrated growth and high viability of M. leprae in nu/nu FPs over a 4 month infection period. In contrast, viability was markedly decreased by 8 weeks in immunocompetent mice. Rifapentine significantly reduced bacterial viability after 5 treatments, whereas rifampin required up to 20 treatments for the same efficacy. Neither drug was effective after a single treatment. In addition, host gene expression was monitored with the same RNA preparations.
hsp18 and esxA qRT-PCR are sensitive molecular indicators, reliably detecting viability of M. leprae in tissues without the need for bacterial isolation or immediate processing, making these assays applicable for in vivo drug screening and promising for clinical and field applications.
","M. leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, cannot be grown on laboratory culture media. This characteristic, along with its extremely long generation time of 12–14 days, makes the study of the pathogenicity of this organism and the experimental testing of new drugs for the treatment of leprosy extremely difficult. We developed two M. leprae-specific quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays and tested their utility as biological markers of M. leprae viability in tissue specimens. These assays could detect high viability of bacilli growing in immunosuppressed mice as well as the inhibitory effects of anti-leprosy drug treatment, or of the host immune system in immunocompetent mice. The RNA preparations were also successfully used for detection of host gene expression. The application of these assays to various experimental models would benefit characterization of the infection or novel drug screening. Furthermore, because these assays utilize fixed tissues, their potential application to clinical and field settings could enable monitoring of M. leprae viability in conjunction with the host immune response during treatment.

"M. tuberculosis N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmUMtb) is a bi-functional enzyme engaged in the synthesis of two metabolic intermediates N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) and UDP-GlcNAc, catalyzed by the C- and N-terminal domains respectively. UDP-GlcNAc is a key metabolite essential for the synthesis of peptidoglycan, disaccharide linker, arabinogalactan and mycothiols. While glmUMtb was predicted to be an essential gene, till date the role of GlmUMtb in modulating the in vitro growth of Mtb or its role in survival of pathogen ex vivo / in vivo have not been deciphered. Here we present the results of a comprehensive study dissecting the role of GlmUMtb in arbitrating the survival of the pathogen both in vitro and in vivo. We find that absence of GlmUMtb leads to extensive perturbation of bacterial morphology and substantial reduction in cell wall thickness under normoxic as well as hypoxic conditions. Complementation studies show that the acetyl- and uridyl- transferase activities of GlmUMtb are independently essential for bacterial survival in vitro, and GlmUMtb is also found to be essential for mycobacterial survival in THP-1 cells as well as in guinea pigs. Depletion of GlmUMtb from infected murine lungs, four weeks post infection, led to significant reduction in the bacillary load. The administration of Oxa33, a novel oxazolidine derivative that specifically inhibits GlmUMtb, to infected mice resulted in significant decrease in the bacillary load. Thus our study establishes GlmUMtb as a strong candidate for intervention measures against established tuberculosis infections.
","The synthesis of the Mtb cell wall involves a cascade of reactions catalyzed by cytosolic and cell membrane-bound enzymes. The reaction catalyzed by GlmUMtb (an enzyme with acetyltransferase and uridyltransferase activities) generates UDP-GlcNAc, a central nucleotide-sugar building block of the cell wall. Apart from cell wall synthesis UDP-GlcNAc is an essential metabolite participating in other cellular processes including disaccharide linker and mycothiol biosynthesis. GlmUMtb shares very little sequence similarity with eukaryotic acetyltransferase and uridyltransferase enzymes. Many pathogens have alternative pathway(s) for foraging GlcNAc from the host. The present study was undertaken to see the effects of depleting GlmUMtb on pathogen survival in the host animal. We have generated a conditional gene replacement mutant of glmUMtb and find that depletion of GlmUMtb at any stage of bacterial growth or in mice infected with Mtb including a well-established infection, results in irreversible bacterial death due to perturbation of cell wall synthesis. We have developed a novel anti-GlmUMtb inhibitor (Oxa33), identified its binding site on GlmUMtb, and shown its specificity for GlmUMtb. The study demonstrates that GlmUMtb is a promising target for therapeutic intervention and Oxa33 can be pursued as a lead molecule.

"The microenvironment of lymphoid organs can aid healthy immune function through provision of both structural and molecular support. In mice, fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) create an essential T-cell support structure within lymph nodes, while human FRCs are largely unstudied. Here, we show that FRCs create a regulatory checkpoint in human peripheral T-cell activation through 4 mechanisms simultaneously utilised. Human tonsil and lymph node–derived FRCs constrained the proliferation of both naïve and pre-activated T cells, skewing their differentiation away from a central memory T-cell phenotype. FRCs acted unilaterally without requiring T-cell feedback, imposing suppression via indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, adenosine 2A Receptor, prostaglandin E2, and transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFβR). Each mechanistic pathway was druggable, and a cocktail of inhibitors, targeting all 4 mechanisms, entirely reversed the suppressive effect of FRCs. T cells were not permanently anergised by FRCs, and studies using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells showed that immunotherapeutic T cells retained effector functions in the presence of FRCs. Since mice were not suitable as a proof-of-concept model, we instead developed a novel human tissue–based in situ assay. Human T cells stimulated using standard methods within fresh tonsil slices did not proliferate except in the presence of inhibitors described above. Collectively, we define a 4-part molecular mechanism by which FRCs regulate the T-cell response to strongly activating events in secondary lymphoid organs while permitting activated and CAR T cells to utilise effector functions. Our results define 4 feasible strategies, used alone or in combinations, to boost primary T-cell responses to infection or cancer by pharmacologically targeting FRCs.
","The lymph node microenvironment contains an abundance of immune cells that interact with and within an intricate structural framework created by fibroblastic reticular cells. In mice, fibroblastic reticular cells are known to regulate T-cell activation, proliferation, and function, but in humans, they are poorly understood. We investigated interactions between human T cells and human fibroblastic reticular cells from tonsils and lymph nodes. When T cells were activated in the presence of human fibroblastic reticular cells, their proliferation and differentiation were reduced, without altering effector T-cell function, shown through cytokine production. We identified 4 molecular mechanisms that were responsible, concurrently used by all human fibroblast donors tested, and reversible upon addition of specific inhibitors to the cocultures. To establish the relevance of this finding outside of in vitro coculture, we showed that T-cell proliferation was increased in live human tonsil tissue slices when the fibroblastic reticular cell inhibitors were added. This work demonstrates that human fibroblastic reticular cells regulate T-cell activation and provides new information on the mechanisms used, which may be useful to design clinical strategies that improve T-cell responses.

"In mice, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and natural killer (NK) cells both contribute to resistance to systemic infections with herpes viruses including mouse Cytomegalovirus (MCMV). pDCs are the major source of type I IFN (IFN-I) during MCMV infection. This response requires pDC-intrinsic MyD88-dependent signaling by Toll-Like Receptors 7 and 9. Provided that they express appropriate recognition receptors such as Ly49H, NK cells can directly sense and kill MCMV-infected cells. The loss of any one of these responses increases susceptibility to infection. However, the relative importance of these antiviral immune responses and how they are related remain unclear. In humans, while IFN-I responses are essential, MyD88 is dispensable for antiviral immunity. Hence, a higher redundancy has been proposed in the mechanisms promoting protective immune responses against systemic infections by herpes viruses during natural infections in humans. It has been assumed, but not proven, that mice fail to mount protective MyD88-independent IFN-I responses. In humans, the mechanism that compensates MyD88 deficiency has not been elucidated. To address these issues, we compared resistance to MCMV infection and immune responses between mouse strains deficient for MyD88, the IFN-I receptor and/or Ly49H. We show that selective depletion of pDC or genetic deficiencies for MyD88 or TLR9 drastically decreased production of IFN-I, but not the protective antiviral responses. Moreover, MyD88, but not IFN-I receptor, deficiency could largely be compensated by Ly49H-mediated antiviral NK cell responses. Thus, contrary to the current dogma but consistent with the situation in humans, we conclude that, in mice, in our experimental settings, MyD88 is redundant for IFN-I responses and overall defense against a systemic herpes virus infection. Moreover, we identified direct NK cell sensing of infected cells as one mechanism able to compensate for MyD88 deficiency in mice. Similar mechanisms likely contribute to protect MyD88- or IRAK4-deficient patients from viral infections.
","Type I interferons (IFN-I) are innate cytokines crucial for vertebrate antiviral defenses. IFN-I exert antiviral effector functions and orchestrate antiviral immunity. IFN-I are induced early after infection, upon sensing of viral particles or infected cells by immune receptors. Intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLR) are selectively expressed in specialized immune cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), enabling them to copiously produce IFN-I upon detection of engulfed viral nucleic acids. pDC or intracellular TLR have been reported to be crucial for resistance to experimental infections with many viruses in mice but dispensable for resistance to natural infections in humans. Our aim was to investigate this puzzling difference. Mice deficient for TLR activity mounted strong IFN-I responses despite producing very low IFN-I levels and controlled the infection by a moderate dose of murine cytomegalovirus much better than mice deficient for IFN-I responses. Deficient TLR responses could be compensated by direct recognition of infected cells by natural killer cells. Hence, we identified experimental conditions in mice mimicking the lack of requirement of TLR functions for antiviral defense observed in humans. We used these experimental models to advance our basic understanding of antiviral immunity in a way that might help improve treatments for patients.

"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are severely depleted during chronic HIV-1 infection by unclear mechanisms. We report here that human ILC1s comprising of CD4+ and CD4- subpopulations were present in various human lymphoid organs but with different transcription programs and functions. Importantly, CD4+ ILC1s expressed HIV-1 co-receptors and were productively infected by HIV-1 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, chronic HIV-1 infection activated and depleted both CD4+ and CD4- ILC1s, and impaired their cytokine production activity. Highly active antiretroviral (HAART) therapy in HIV-1 patients efficiently rescued the ILC1 numbers and reduced their activation, but failed to restore their functionality. We also found that blocking type-I interferon (IFN-I) signaling during HIV-1 infection in vivo in humanized mice prevented HIV-1 induced depletion or apoptosis of ILC1 cells. Therefore, we have identified the CD4+ ILC1 cells as a new target population for HIV-1 infection, and revealed that IFN-I contributes to the depletion of ILC1s during HIV-1 infection.
","Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), including ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 populations, represent a novel cellular family of the immune system and have potentials to produce large amounts of T cell-associated cytokines in response to innate stimulation in the absence of specific antigen stimulation. ILCs have emerged as central players in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, and correlated with the pathogenesis and progression of multiple human diseases. It is reported that ILCs are depleted in HIV-1 infected patients. However, it is not clear whether HIV-1 can infect ILCs and how ILCs are depleted during HIV-1 infection. Here, we find that ILC1s consist CD4+ and CD4- subsets and both are present in various human lymphoid organs. We show that HIV-1 can directly infect CD4+ ILC1s. HIV-1 infection leads to activation, depletion and functional impairment of ILC1s in humans and in humanized mice in vivo. Blocking IFN-I signaling prevents HIV-1-induced apoptosis of ILC1s both in vitro and in humanized mice in vivo. Our study reveals the CD4+ ILC1 population as a new target for HIV-1 infection and identifies an IFN-I mediated mechanism of ILC1 depletion during chronic HIV-1 infection.

"Considering the short lifetime of IgA antibodies in serum and the key advantages of antibody detection ELISAs in terms of sensitivity and specificity, Bio-Rad has just developed a new ELISA test based on the detection of specific anti-dengue IgA. This study has been carried out to assess the performance of this Platelia Dengue IgA Capture assay for dengue infection detection. A total of 184 well-characterized samples provided by the French Guiana NRC sera collection (Laboratory of Virology, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana) were selected among samples collected between 2002 and 2013 from patients exhibiting a dengue-like syndrome. A first group included 134 sera from confirmed dengue-infected patients, and a second included 50 sera from non-dengue infected patients, all collected between day 3 and day 15 after the onset of fever. Dengue infection diagnoses were all confirmed using reference assays by direct virological identification using RT-PCR or virus culture on acute sera samples or on paired acute-phase sera samples of selected convalescent sera. This study revealed: i) a good overall sensitivity and specificity of the IgA index test, i.e., 93% and 88% respectively, indicating its good correlation to acute dengue diagnosis; and ii) a good concordance with the Panbio IgM capture ELISA. Because of the shorter persistence of dengue virus-specific IgA than IgM, these results underlined the relevance of this new test, which could significantly improve dengue diagnosis accuracy, especially in countries where dengue virus is (hyper-) endemic. It would allow for additional refinement of dengue diagnostic strategy.
","Dengue disease has become a major global public health concern, but an ideal diagnostic test that permits early and rapid diagnosis is not yet available. Improving diagnostic performance in this area is a major challenge and necessitates the development and evaluation of new efficient, accurate methods. According to the kinetics of dengue infection in serum, virus isolation and nucleic acid or antigen detection are the most specific diagnostic methods during the early acute stage of disease; serology is often used for diagnosis later in the course of infection. In order to provide an earlier and reliable dating of the dengue infection, few recent studies showed that the detection of specific IgA in the serum is a useful diagnostic parameter. Exploring that new approach, this study was carried out to assess the performance of a Platelia Dengue IgA Capture assay for dengue infection detection, newly developed by Bio-Rad, using 184 well-characterized samples provided by the French Guiana NRC sera collection of the Institut Pasteur in French Guiana. This study revealed good overall performances of this test, constituting promising assistance in dengue diagnosis, especially in hyper-endemic countries.

"Measureable rates of genome evolution are well documented in human pathogens but are less well understood in bacterial pathogens in the wild, particularly during and after host switches. Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is a pathogenic bacterium that has evolved predominantly in poultry and recently jumped to wild house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), a common North American songbird. For the first time we characterize the genome and measure rates of genome evolution in House Finch isolates of MG, as well as in poultry outgroups. Using whole-genome sequences of 12 House Finch isolates across a 13-year serial sample and an additional four newly sequenced poultry strains, we estimate a nucleotide diversity in House Finch isolates of only ∼2% of ancestral poultry strains and a nucleotide substitution rate of 0.8−1.2×10−5 per site per year both in poultry and in House Finches, an exceptionally fast rate rivaling some of the highest estimates reported thus far for bacteria. We also found high diversity and complete turnover of CRISPR arrays in poultry MG strains prior to the switch to the House Finch host, but after the invasion of House Finches there is progressive loss of CRISPR repeat diversity, and recruitment of novel CRISPR repeats ceases. Recent (2007) House Finch MG strains retain only ∼50% of the CRISPR repertoire founding (1994–95) strains and have lost the CRISPR–associated genes required for CRISPR function. Our results suggest that genome evolution in bacterial pathogens of wild birds can be extremely rapid and in this case is accompanied by apparent functional loss of CRISPRs.
","Documenting the evolutionary changes occurring in pathogens when they switch hosts is important for understanding mechanisms of adaptation and rates of evolution. We took advantage of a novel host–pathogen system involving a bacterial pathogen (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, or MG) and a songbird host, the House Finch, to study genome-wide changes during a host-shift. Around 1994, biologists noticed that House Finches were contracting conjunctivitis and MG from poultry was discovered to be the cause. The resulting epizootic was one of the best documented for a wildlife species, partly as a result of thousands of citizen science observers. We sequenced the genomes of 12 House Finch MG strains sampled throughout the epizootic, from 1994–2007, as well as four additional putatively ancestral poultry MG strains. Using this serial sample, we estimate a remarkably high rate of substitution, consistent with past implications that mycoplasmas are among the fastest evolving bacteria. We also find that an array of likely phage-derived sequences known as CRISPRs has degraded and ceased to recruit new repeats in the House Finch MG strains, as compared to the poultry strains in which it is diverse and rapidly evolving. This suggests that phage dynamics might be important in the dynamics of MG infection.

"Folate-sensitive fragile sites (FSFS) are a rare cytogenetically visible subset of dynamic mutations. Of the eight molecularly characterized FSFS, four are associated with intellectual disability (ID). Cytogenetic expression results from CGG tri-nucleotide-repeat expansion mutation associated with local CpG hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. The best studied is the FRAXA site in the FMR1 gene, where large expansions cause fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited ID syndrome. Here we studied three families with FRA2A expression at 2q11 associated with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. We identified a polymorphic CGG repeat in a conserved, brain-active alternative promoter of the AFF3 gene, an autosomal homolog of the X-linked AFF2/FMR2 gene: Expansion of the AFF2 CGG repeat causes FRAXE ID. We found that FRA2A-expressing individuals have mosaic expansions of the AFF3 CGG repeat in the range of several hundred repeat units. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing both suggest AFF3 promoter hypermethylation. cSNP-analysis demonstrates monoallelic expression of the AFF3 gene in FRA2A carriers thus predicting that FRA2A expression results in functional haploinsufficiency for AFF3 at least in a subset of tissues. By whole-mount in situ hybridization the mouse AFF3 ortholog shows strong regional expression in the developing brain, somites and limb buds in 9.5–12.5dpc mouse embryos. Our data suggest that there may be an association between FRA2A and a delay in the acquisition of motor and language skills in the families studied here. However, additional cases are required to firmly establish a causal relationship.
","Some human genetic diseases are caused by dynamic mutations, or expansions of a short repeated sequence in the genome that can be unstably passed on from generation to generation. A subset of these dynamic mutations known as fragile sites can be seen as a break or gap on the chromosome when cells are cultured under specific conditions. To date eight folate-sensitive fragile sites (FSFS) have been characterized, and all are due to CGG-repeat expansions within the 5′ UTR or promoter region of the respective gene. When the repeat expands in size, it becomes hypermethylated and the adjacent gene or genes are transcriptionally silenced. For at least four of the eight known fragile sites this silencing of the associated gene(s) lead to intellectual disability syndromes such as fragile X. In this work we describe molecular characterization of an autosomal FSFS called FRA2A on chromosome 2. As the molecular cause of FRA2A, we identify an expansion of a CGG repeat which subsequently results in silencing of the neighbouring gene AFF3. This gene is one of the four autosomal paralogss of the AFF2/FMR2 gene which, when mutated, is the cause of the FRAXE syndrome. We find that FRA2A expression is associated with highly variable developmental anomalies in the three FRA2A families studied.

"Immune response against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) includes a set of persistent cytotoxic NK and CD8 T cells devoted to eliminate infected cells and to prevent reactivation. CD8 T cells against HCMV antigens (pp65, IE1) presented by HLA class-I molecules are well characterized and they associate with efficient virus control. HLA-E-restricted CD8 T cells targeting HCMV UL40 signal peptides (HLA-EUL40) have recently emerged as a non-conventional T-cell response also observed in some hosts. The occurrence, specificity and features of HLA-EUL40 CD8 T-cell responses remain mostly unknown. Here, we detected and quantified these responses in blood samples from healthy blood donors (n = 25) and kidney transplant recipients (n = 121) and we investigated the biological determinants involved in their occurrence. Longitudinal and phenotype ex vivo analyses were performed in comparison to HLA-A*02/pp65-specific CD8 T cells. Using a set of 11 HLA-E/UL40 peptide tetramers we demonstrated the presence of HLA-EUL40 CD8 αβT cells in up to 32% of seropositive HCMV+ hosts that may represent up to 38% of total circulating CD8 T-cells at a time point suggesting a strong expansion post-infection. Host’s HLA-A*02 allele, HLA-E *01:01/*01:03 genotype and sequence of the UL40 peptide from the infecting strain are major factors affecting the incidence of HLA-EUL40 CD8 T cells. These cells are effector memory CD8 (CD45RAhighROlow, CCR7-, CD27-, CD28-) characterized by a low level of PD-1 expression. HLA-EUL40 responses appear early post-infection and display a broad, unbiased, Vβ repertoire. Although induced in HCMV strain-dependent, UL4015-23-specific manner, HLA-EUL40 CD8 T cells are reactive toward a broader set of nonapeptides varying in 1–3 residues including most HLA-I signal peptides. Thus, HCMV induces strong and life-long lasting HLA-EUL40 CD8 T cells with potential allogeneic or/and autologous reactivity that take place selectively in at least a third of infections according to virus strain and host HLA concordance.
","Understanding the mechanisms of immune control of viral infection is crucial to improve diagnosis and to design efficient immunotherapies. CD8 T lymphocytes are key components of the cellular immunity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread pathogen that cause severe illness and poor outcome in immunocompromised hosts such as transplant recipients and HIV-infected patients. In this study we characterized a population of non-conventional CD8 T lymphocytes directed against the viral protein UL40 and presented by the non-classical HLA-E molecules in blood samples from HCMV seropositive hosts. This immune response was detectable in around 30% of hosts, may represent up to 38% of total blood CD8 T lymphocytes, persists for life and thus seems to belong to the common immune arsenal against HCMV. Genetic factors related to the host and to the different strains of HCMV are critical parameters for the existence of this immune subset. Although specifically induced in response to HCMV infection, a key feature of these cells is their potential ability to be also responsive against multiple HLA molecules. In conclusion, HCMV infection frequently leads to the long-term persistence of a large subset of lymphocytes with potential side effect requiring attention in contexts such as autoimmunity and transplantation.

"The development of a vaccine against dengue faces unique challenges, including the complexity of the immune responses to the four antigenically distinct serotypes. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling provides insight into the pathways and molecular features that underlie responses to immune system stimulation, and may facilitate predictions of immune protection.
In this study, we measured early transcriptional responses in the peripheral blood of cynomolgus macaques following vaccination with a live, attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate, TDV, which is based on a DENV-2 backbone. Different doses and routes of vaccine administration were used, and viral load and neutralizing antibody titers were measured at different time-points following vaccination. All 30 vaccinated animals developed a neutralizing antibody response to each of the four dengue serotypes, and only 3 of these animals had detectable serum viral RNA after challenge with wild-type dengue virus (DENV), suggesting protection of vaccinated animals to DENV infection. The vaccine induced statistically significant changes in 595 gene transcripts on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 as compared with baseline and placebo-treated animals. Genes involved in the type I interferon (IFN) response, including IFI44, DDX58, MX1 and OASL, exhibited the highest fold-change in transcript abundance, and this response was strongest following double dose and subcutaneous (versus intradermal) vaccine administration. In addition, modules of genes involved in antigen presentation, dendritic cell activation, and T cell activation and signaling were enriched following vaccination. Increased abundance of gene transcripts related to T cell activation on day 5, and the type I IFN response on day 7, were significantly correlated with the development of high neutralizing antibody titers on day 30.
These results suggest that early transcriptional responses may be predictive of development of adaptive immunity to TDV vaccination in cynomolgus macaques, and will inform studies of human responses to dengue vaccines.
","Dengue has become the leading cause of mosquito-borne virus infections worldwide. Despite considerable effort, development of a successful vaccine against dengue virus (DENV) has been challenging due to the co-circulation of the four DENV serotypes in endemic areas—to which humans develop distinct immune responses, and the increased risk of severe disease in those with pre-existing immunity to one serotype when they are infected with a different serotype. In this study, we investigated the responses in macaques to vaccination with the tetravalent, live-attenuated vaccine, TDV, by different doses and routes of vaccine administration. We identify changes in macaque gene expression that occurred in the days immediately following vaccination with TDV, a time-period that is difficult to study during natural infection. The gene expression response was characterized by features of the innate immune response to virus, notably the type I interferon response, and began the day after TDV vaccination. This response correlated with the development of neutralizing antibodies, which means that it might serve as an early indicator of a subsequent protective immune response to dengue vaccines.

"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear proteins EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C interact with the cell DNA binding protein RBPJ and regulate cell and viral genes. Repression of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene products p16INK4A and p14ARF by EBNA3A and EBNA3C is critical for EBV mediated transformation of resting B lymphocytes into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). To define the composition of endogenous EBNA3 protein complexes, we generated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) expressing flag-HA tagged EBNA3A, EBNA3B, or EBNA3C and used tandem affinity purification to isolate each EBNA3 complex. Our results demonstrated that each EBNA3 protein forms a distinct complex with RBPJ. Mass-spectrometry revealed that the EBNA3A and EBNA3B complexes also contained the deubquitylation complex consisting of WDR48, WDR20, and USP46 (or its paralog USP12) and that EBNA3C complexes contained WDR48. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C association with the USP46 complex. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that WDR48 and USP46 are recruited to the p14ARF promoter in an EBNA3C dependent manner. Mapping studies were consistent with WDR48 being the primary mediator of EBNA3 association with the DUB complex. By ChIP assay, WDR48 was recruited to the p14ARF promoter in an EBNA3C dependent manner. Importantly, WDR48 associated with EBNA3A and EBNA3C domains that are critical for LCL growth, suggesting a role for USP46/USP12 in EBV induced growth transformation.
","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gammaherpesvirus implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple malignancies, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. EBV infection of resting B-lymphocytes drives them to proliferate as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), an in vitro model of PTLD. LCLs express a limited EBV gene repertoire, including six nuclear proteins (EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and LP), three integral membrane proteins (LMP1, 2A, and 2B), and more than 30 micro RNAs. EBNA2 and the EBNA3 proteins are transcription factors that regulate viral and cell gene expression through the cell DNA binding protein RBPJ. In this study, we established LCLs transformed by recombinant EBV genomes in which a Flag-HA epitope tag is fused in-frame to the C-terminus of EBNA3A, EBNA3B or EBNA3C. Using these LCLs, we purified endogenous EBNA3 complexes and identified the USP46 deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and its associated chaperones WDR48 and WDR20 as EBNA3 binding proteins. We find that EBNA3s interact primarily with the WDR48 protein and that loss of WDR48 interaction with EBNA3A or EBNA3C impairs LCL growth. This study represents the first characterization of EBNA3 complexes from LCLs and implicates the USP46 DUB complex in EBNA3 mediated gene regulation.

"Sphingolipids have essential roles as structural components of cell membranes and in cell signalling, and disruption of their metabolism causes several diseases, with diverse neurological, psychiatric, and metabolic consequences. Increasingly, variants within a few of the genes that encode enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism are being associated with complex disease phenotypes. Direct experimental evidence supports a role of specific sphingolipid species in several common complex chronic disease processes including atherosclerotic plaque formation, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiomyopathy, pancreatic β-cell failure, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, sphingolipids represent novel and important intermediate phenotypes for genetic analysis, yet little is known about the major genetic variants that influence their circulating levels in the general population. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) between 318,237 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and levels of circulating sphingomyelin (SM), dihydrosphingomyelin (Dih-SM), ceramide (Cer), and glucosylceramide (GluCer) single lipid species (33 traits); and 43 matched metabolite ratios measured in 4,400 subjects from five diverse European populations. Associated variants (32) in five genomic regions were identified with genome-wide significant corrected p-values ranging down to 9.08×10−66. The strongest associations were observed in or near 7 genes functionally involved in ceramide biosynthesis and trafficking: SPTLC3, LASS4, SGPP1, ATP10D, and FADS1–3. Variants in 3 loci (ATP10D, FADS3, and SPTLC3) associate with MI in a series of three German MI studies. An additional 70 variants across 23 candidate genes involved in sphingolipid-metabolizing pathways also demonstrate association (p = 10−4 or less). Circulating concentrations of several key components in sphingolipid metabolism are thus under strong genetic control, and variants in these loci can be tested for a role in the development of common cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric diseases.
","Although several rare monogenic diseases are caused by defects in enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolism, little is known about the major variants that control the circulating levels of these important bioactive molecules. As well as being essential components of plasma membranes and endosomes, sphingolipids play critical roles in cell surface protection, protein and lipid transport and sorting, and cellular signalling cascades. Experimental evidence supports a role for sphingolipids in several common complex chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, or neurological disease processes. Therefore, sphingolipids represent novel and important intermediate phenotypes for genetic analysis, and discovering the genetic variants that influence their circulating concentrations is an important step towards understanding how the genetic control of sphingolipids might contribute to common human disease. We have identified 32 variants in 7 genes that have a strong effect on the circulating plasma levels of 33 distinct sphingolipids, and 43 matched metabolite ratios. In a series of 3 German MI studies, we see association with MI for variants in 3 of the genes tested. Further cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric disease associations can be tested with the variants described here, which may identify additional disease risk and potentially useful therapeutic targets.

"The disease burden of Wuchereria bancrofti and Plasmodium falciparum malaria is high, particularly in Africa, and co-infection is common. However, the effects of filarial infection on the risk of severe malaria are unknown. We used the remaining serum samples from a large cohort study in Muheza, Tanzania to describe vector-borne filarial sero-reactivity among young children and to identify associations between exposure to filarial parasites and subsequent severe malaria infections. We identified positive filarial antibody responses (as well as positive antibody responses to Strongyloides stercoralis) among infants as young as six months. In addition, we found a significant association between filarial seropositivity at six months of age and subsequent severe malaria. Specifically, infants who developed severe malaria by one year of age were 3.9 times more likely (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 13.0) to have been seropositive for filarial antigen at six months of age compared with infants who did not develop severe malaria.
","In this paper, we used a multiplexed, serologic assessment to identify children with previous or current exposure to or infection with filarial parasites or S. stercoralis (a soil transmitted helminth), enhancing our understanding of co-infections in early childhood. We identified an increasing prevalence of filarial antibodies over time in a population of children as young as 6 months old. In addition, we found a significant association between filarial seropositivity at six months of age and subsequent severe malaria.

"Parasitic roundworm infections plague more than 2 billion people (1/3 of humanity) and cause drastic losses in crops and livestock. New anthelmintic drugs are urgently needed as new drug resistance and environmental concerns arise. A “chokepoint reaction” is defined as a reaction that either consumes a unique substrate or produces a unique product. A chokepoint analysis provides a systematic method of identifying novel potential drug targets. Chokepoint enzymes were identified in the genomes of 10 nematode species, and the intersection and union of all chokepoint enzymes were found. By studying and experimentally testing available compounds known to target proteins orthologous to nematode chokepoint proteins in public databases, this study uncovers features of chokepoints that make them successful drug targets. Chemogenomic screening was performed on drug-like compounds from public drug databases to find existing compounds that target homologs of nematode chokepoints. The compounds were prioritized based on chemical properties frequently found in successful drugs and were experimentally tested using Caenorhabditis elegans. Several drugs that are already known anthelmintic drugs and novel candidate targets were identified. Seven of the compounds were tested in Caenorhabditis elegans and three yielded a detrimental phenotype. One of these three drug-like compounds, Perhexiline, also yielded a deleterious effect in Haemonchus contortus and Onchocerca lienalis, two nematodes with divergent forms of parasitism. Perhexiline, known to affect the fatty acid oxidation pathway in mammals, caused a reduction in oxygen consumption rates in C. elegans and genome-wide gene expression profiles provided an additional confirmation of its mode of action. Computational modeling of Perhexiline and its target provided structural insights regarding its binding mode and specificity. Our lists of prioritized drug targets and drug-like compounds have potential to expedite the discovery of new anthelmintic drugs with broad-spectrum efficacy.
","The World Health Organization estimates that 2.9 million people are infected with parasitic roundworms, causing high-morbidity and mortality rates, developmental delays in children, and low productivity of affected individuals. The agricultural industry experiences drastic losses in crop and livestock due to parasitic worm infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new targets and drugs to fight parasitic nematode infection. This study identified metabolic chokepoint compounds that were either produced or consumed by a single reaction and elucidated the chokepoint enzyme that drives the reaction. If the enzyme that catalyzes that reaction is blocked, a toxic build-up of a compound or lack of compound necessary for subsequent reaction will occur, potentially causing adverse effects to the parasite organism. Compounds that target some of the chokepoint enzymes were tested in C. elegans and several compounds showed efficacy. One drug-like compound, Perhexiline, showed efficacy in two different parasitic worms and yielded expected physiological effects, indicating that this drug-like compound may have efficacy on a pan-phylum level through the predicted mode of action. The methodology to find and prioritize metabolic chokepoint targets and prioritize compounds could be applied to other parasites.

"Pandemics of vector-borne human and plant diseases often depend on the behaviors of their arthropod vectors. Arboviruses, including many bunyaviruses, manipulate vector behavior to accelerate their own transmission to vertebrates, birds, insects, and plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this manipulation remains elusive. Here, we report that the non-structural protein NSs of Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus, a prototype of the Tospoviridae family and the Orthotospovirus genus, is a key viral factor that indirectly modifies vector preference and increases vector performance. NSs suppresses the biosynthesis of plant volatile monoterpenes, which serve as repellents of the vector western flower thrips (WFT, Frankliniella occidentalis). NSs directly interacts with MYC2, the jasmonate (JA) signaling master regulator and its two close homologs MYC3 and MYC4, to disable JA-mediated activation of terpene synthase genes. The dysfunction of the MYCs subsequently attenuates host defenses, increases the attraction of thrips, and improves thrips fitness. Moreover, MYC2 associated with NSs of Tomato zonate spot orthotospovirus, another Euro/Asian-type orthotospovirus, suggesting that MYC2 is an evolutionarily conserved target of Orthotospovirus species for suppression of terpene-based resistance to promote vector performance. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which an orthotospovirus indirectly manipulates vector behaviors and therefore facilitates pathogen transmission. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which Orthotospovirus NSs counteracts plant immunity for pathogen transmission.
","Most bunyaviruses are transmitted by arthropod vectors, and some of them can modify the behaviors of their arthropod vectors to increase transmission to mammals, birds, and plants. NSs is a non-structural bunyavirus protein with multiple functions that acts as an avirulence determinant and silencing suppressor. In this study, we identified a new function of NSs as a conserved manipulator of vector behavior via plant. NSs suppresses jasmonate-mediated plant immunity against thrips by directly interacting with several homologs of MYC transcription factors, the core regulators of the jasmonate-signaling pathway. This hijacking by NSs enhances thrips preference and performance. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that MYC2 is a convergent target that plant pathogens manipulate to promote their survival in plants.

"Oral transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is the most important route of infection in Brazilian Amazon and Venezuela. Other South American countries have also reported outbreaks associated with food consumption. A recent study showed the importance of parasite contact with oral cavity to induce a highly severe acute disease in mice. However, it remains uncertain the primary site of parasite entry and multiplication due to an oral infection. Here, we evaluated the presence of T. cruzi Dm28c luciferase (Dm28c-luc) parasites in orally infected mice, by bioluminescence and quantitative real-time PCR. In vivo bioluminescent images indicated the nasomaxillary region as the site of parasite invasion in the host, becoming consistently infected throughout the acute phase. At later moments, 7 and 21 days post-infection (dpi), luminescent signal is denser in the thorax, abdomen and genital region, because of parasite dissemination in different tissues. Ex vivo analysis demonstrated that the nasomaxillary region, heart, mandibular lymph nodes, liver, spleen, brain, epididymal fat associated to male sex organs, salivary glands, cheek muscle, mesenteric fat and lymph nodes, stomach, esophagus, small and large intestine are target tissues at latter moments of infection. In the same line, amastigote nests of Dm28c GFP T. cruzi were detected in the nasal cavity of 6 dpi mice. Parasite quantification by real-time qPCR at 7 and 21 dpi showed predominant T. cruzi detection and expansion in mouse nasal cavity. Moreover, T. cruzi DNA was also observed in the mandibular lymph nodes, pituitary gland, heart, liver, small intestine and spleen at 7 dpi, and further, disseminated to other tissues, such as the brain, stomach, esophagus and large intestine at 21 dpi. Our results clearly demonstrated that oral cavity and adjacent compartments is the main target region in oral T. cruzi infection leading to parasite multiplication at the nasal cavity.
","Oral transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi associated with food/beverage consumption is presently an important route of infection in Brazil and Venezuela. Colombia, Bolivia, Argentina and Ecuador have also reported to have acute cases of Chagas disease transmission through the oral route. Significant studies about this form of T. cruzi infection are largely lacking. In addition to the classic cardiac involvement, orally-infected patient progress to a highly symptomatic disease and increased mortality rate (8–35%), surpassing the calculated mortality produced by the disease resulting from the biting of infected insect vectors (5–10%). Here, we explored by in vivo bioluminescent images, qPCR and fluorescence microscopy the primary site of parasite entry and multiplication in oral infection (OI). Our results clearly demonstrated that the oral cavity is the main T. cruzi target region in OI, leading to parasite multiplication at the nasal cavity and parasite dissemination to the brain and peripheral tissues. Interestingly, facial edema, paraesthesia of the tongue, gingivitis and dry cough were already described in affected patients. These findings might be associated to our present data, which describe for the first time the nasomaxillary region as the main target tissue following oral T. cruzi infection.

"Although leprosy is efficiently treated by multidrug therapy, resistance to first-line (dapsone, rifampin) and to second-line drugs (fluoroquinolones) was described worldwide. Since Mycobacterium leprae is not growing in vitro, phenotypic susceptibility testing requires a one year experiment in the mouse model and this is rarely performed. Genetics on antibiotic resistance provide the basis for molecular tests able to detect for antibiotic resistance in leprosy.
A reverse hybridization DNA strip test was developed as the GenoType LepraeDR test. It includes DNA probes for the wild-type sequence of regions of rpoB, gyrA and folP genes and probes for the prevalent mutations involved in acquired resistance to rifampin, fluoroquinolones and dapsone, respectively. The performances of the GenoType LepraeDR test were evaluated by comparing its results on 120 M. leprae strains, previously studied for resistance by the reference drug in vivo susceptibility method in the mouse footpad and for mutations in the gene regions described above by PCR-sequencing. The results of the test were 100% concordant with those of PCR sequencing and the mouse footpad test for the resistant strains: 16 strains resistant to rifampin, 22 to dapsone and 4 to ofloxacin with mutations (numbering system of the M. leprae genome) in rpoB (10 S456L, 1 S456F, 1 S456M + L458V, 1 H451Y, 1 G432S + H451D, 1 T433I + D441Y and 1 Q438V), in folP1 (8 P55L, 3 P55R, 7 T53I, 3 T53A, 1 T53V) and gyrA (4 A91V), respectively. Concordance was 98.3% for the susceptible strains, two strains showing a mutation at the codon 447 that in fact was not conferring resistance as shown by the in vivo method.
The GenoType LepraeDR test is a commercially available test that accurately detects for antibiotic resistance in leprosy cases. The test is easy to perform and could be implemented in endemic countries.
","Although leprosy is a curable disease using a combination of antibiotics for one year, the transmission is still active with 230,000 new cases in 2010. Drug resistance has been described and may prevent eradication of the disease. The infectious agent causing leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae, is not growing in vitro and antibiotic susceptibility testing is possible only in the mouse footpad model that requires a one year experiment. Consequently this testing is rarely done and antibiotic resistance rates in leprosy are unknown. This is the reason why we endeavored to set a new diagnosis test that detects for antibiotic resistance in M. leprae. The test is based on the method of a DNA strip test with a multiplex PCR followed by reverse hybridization. It was developed as an easy-to-use test and it will be available in endemic countries, where these kinds of strip tests are already used for detection of drug resistance in tuberculosis. The results of the new test, Genotype LepraeDR, performed on 120 M. leprae strains were concordant with those of the standard PCR sequencing and mouse footpad susceptibility testing.

"The nuclear lamina is a major obstacle encountered by herpesvirus nucleocapsids in their passage from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (nuclear egress). We found that the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoded protein kinase UL97, which is required for efficient nuclear egress, phosphorylates the nuclear lamina component lamin A/C in vitro on sites targeted by Cdc2/cyclin-dependent kinase 1, the enzyme that is responsible for breaking down the nuclear lamina during mitosis. Quantitative mass spectrometry analyses, comparing lamin A/C isolated from cells infected with viruses either expressing or lacking UL97 activity, revealed UL97-dependent phosphorylation of lamin A/C on the serine at residue 22 (Ser22). Transient treatment of HCMV-infected cells with maribavir, an inhibitor of UL97 kinase activity, reduced lamin A/C phosphorylation by approximately 50%, consistent with UL97 directly phosphorylating lamin A/C during HCMV replication. Phosphorylation of lamin A/C during viral replication was accompanied by changes in the shape of the nucleus, as well as thinning, invaginations, and discrete breaks in the nuclear lamina, all of which required UL97 activity. As Ser22 is a phosphorylation site of particularly strong relevance for lamin A/C disassembly, our data support a model wherein viral mimicry of a mitotic host cell kinase activity promotes nuclear egress while accommodating viral arrest of the cell cycle.
","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes life-threatening disease in transplant patients and people with AIDS, and is also an important cause of birth defects. Like all viruses, HCMV must have a way to leave the host cell, so that it can infect new cells. Moreover, as a member of the herpesvirus family, HCMV replicates its DNA in the nucleus, so it must have mechanisms to ensure that its genetic material can exit from the nucleus (nuclear egress). HCMV encodes a protein kinase, UL97, which is required for efficient nuclear egress. We found that UL97 aids nuclear egress by mimicking a host cell enzyme that normally helps break down a protein meshwork in the nucleus during cell division. The enzyme activity of UL97 pokes holes in the meshwork that allow nascent HCMV virions to gain access to the nuclear membrane. UL97 is also an important target for drugs for treating HCMV disease. This work not only helps explain how these drugs act, but also highlights the potential of targeting nuclear egress for the discovery of new drugs.

"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a powerful regulator of neovascularization. VEGF binding to its cognate receptor, VEGFR2, activates a number of signaling pathways including ERK1/2. Activation of ERK1/2 is experimentally shown to involve sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) activation and its calcium-dependent translocation downstream of ERK1/2. Here we construct a rule-based computational model of signaling downstream of VEGFR2, by including SphK1 and calcium positive feedback mechanisms, and investigate their consequences on ERK1/2 activation. The model predicts the existence of VEGF threshold in ERK1/2 activation that can be continuously tuned by cellular concentrations of SphK1 and sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P). The computer model also predicts powerful effects of perturbations in plasma and ER calcium pump rates and the current through the CRAC channels on ERK1/2 activation dynamics, highlighting the critical role of intracellular calcium in shaping the pERK1/2 signal. The model is then utilized to simulate anti-angiogenic therapeutic interventions targeting VEGFR2-ERK1/2 axis. Simulations indicate that monotherapies that exclusively target VEGFR2 phosphorylation, VEGF, or VEGFR2 are ineffective in shutting down signaling to ERK1/2. By simulating therapeutic strategies that target multiple nodes of the pathway such as Raf and SphK1, we conclude that combination therapy should be much more effective in blocking VEGF signaling to EKR1/2. The model has important implications for interventions that target signaling pathways in angiogenesis relevant to cancer, vascular diseases, and wound healing.
","Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is a potent regulator of angiogenesis, the growth and development of new vessels out of a preexisting vascular network. Angiogenesis requires enhanced survival, proliferation, and motility of the vascular endothelial cells. Crucial signaling endpoints in VEGF-mediated angiogenic response include elevation in intracellular calcium and the activation of the proteins ERK1 and 2 (ERK1/2). In this study, we have developed a novel computer model for the activation of ERK1/2 and calcium downstream of VEGF receptor type 2 (VEGFR2). Our model is the first of its kind to incorporate and investigate the consequences of calcium elevation and the role of a cellular lipid modifier known as sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1). We also utilize the model to simulate therapeutic strategies targeting VEGF signaling to ERK1/2 indicating inefficiency of single therapies known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target receptor phosphorylation. Computer simulations indicate that combination therapy is essential for effective blockade of this important pathway. Our results have important implications for human diseases such as cancer where plethora of anti-VEGF therapies are currently employed. Overall, our computer model sheds new light on a complex feedback involving SphK1 and calcium that radically alters the response of cells to VEGF.

"Tuberculosis is a global health problem and at least one-third of the world’s population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). MTB is a successful pathogen that enhances its own intracellular survival by inhibiting inflammation and arresting phago-lysosomal fusion. We previously demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) dense granule antigen (GRA) 7 interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 via Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, enabling innate immune responses in macrophages. To extend these studies, we found that GRA7 interacts with host proteins involved in antimicrobial host defense mechanisms as a therapeutic strategy for tuberculosis. Here, we show that protein kinase C (PKC)α-mediated phosphorylation of T. gondii GRA7-I (Ser52) regulates the interaction of GRA7 with PYD domain of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a carboxy-terminal CARD, which is capable of oligomerization and inflammasome activation can lead to antimicrobial defense against MTB. Furthermore, GRA7-III interacted with the PX domain of phospholipase D1, facilitating its enzyme activity, phago-lysosomal maturation, and subsequent antimicrobial activity in a GRA7-III (Ser135) phosphorylation-dependent manner via PKCα. Taken together, these results underscore a previously unrecognized role of GRA7 in modulating antimicrobial host defense mechanism during mycobacterial infection.
","We previously demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) dense granule antigen (GRA) 7 interacts with TRAF6 via MyD88, enabling innate immune responses in macrophages and effective protection against T. gondii infection in vivo. However, its exact role and how it regulates host innate immune responses have not been fully explained. Herein, we show that PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of GRA7 is essential for the interaction between GRA7 and ASC or PLD1, which can promote antimicrobial defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Notably, PKCα specifically phosphorylated Ser52 and Ser135 of GRA7 in vitro and in vivo, indicating that GRA7 is a substrate of PKCα. The N-terminal of GRA7 (GRA7-I) was sufficient for interaction with the PYD domain of ASC, which is capable of ASC oligomerization and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, GRA7-III interacted with the PX domain of PLD1, facilitating its enzyme activity, phago-lysosomal maturation, and subsequent antimicrobial activity in a GRA7 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Interestingly, phosphomimetic mutation in GRA7 overcame the need for PKCα. Collectively, these results provide novel insight into how GRA7 can promote ASC and PLD1 activation in a PKCα-dependent manner as an antimicrobial host defense mechanism.

"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes latency in trigeminal ganglia (TG) sensory neurons of infected individuals. The commitment of infected neurons toward the viral lytic or latent transcriptional program is likely to depend on both viral and cellular factors, and to differ among individual neurons. In this study, we used a mouse model of HSV-1 infection to investigate the relationship between viral genomes and the nuclear environment in terms of the establishment of latency. During acute infection, viral genomes show two major patterns: replication compartments or multiple spots distributed in the nucleoplasm (namely “multiple-acute”). Viral genomes in the “multiple-acute” pattern are systematically associated with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein in structures designated viral DNA-containing PML nuclear bodies (vDCP-NBs). To investigate the viral and cellular features that favor the acquisition of the latency-associated viral genome patterns, we infected mouse primary TG neurons from wild type (wt) mice or knock-out mice for type 1 interferon (IFN) receptor with wt or a mutant HSV-1, which is unable to replicate due to the synthesis of a non-functional ICP4, the major virus transactivator. We found that the inability of the virus to initiate the lytic program combined to its inability to synthesize a functional ICP0, are the two viral features leading to the formation of vDCP-NBs. The formation of the “multiple-latency” pattern is favored by the type 1 IFN signaling pathway in the context of neurons infected by a virus able to replicate through the expression of a functional ICP4 but unable to express functional VP16 and ICP0. Analyses of TGs harvested from HSV-1 latently infected humans showed that viral genomes and PML occupy similar nuclear areas in infected neurons, eventually forming vDCP-NB-like structures. Overall our study designates PML protein and PML-NBs to be major cellular components involved in the control of HSV-1 latency, probably during the entire life of an individual.
","Establishment of latency of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) at the cellular level results from the combination of a series of complex molecular events involving cellular and viral-associated features. HSV-1 establishes latency in trigeminal ganglia (TG) sensory neurons. HSV-1 genomes remain as extrachromosomal DNA; their initial interaction with the nuclear architecture is likely to determine commitment toward the lytic or the latent transcriptional program. Among the major nuclear components that influence the infection process the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) play a major role as nuclear relays of the intrinsic antiviral response. In this study, using infected mice and cultured mouse primary TG neuron models, as well as human TGs, we investigated the interaction between HSV-1 genomes and the nuclear environment in individual neurons. We found that the inability of HSV-1 to initiate a lytic program at the initial stages of infection led to the formation of latency-associated viral DNA-containing PML-NBs (vDCP-NBs), or another pattern if the type 1 interferon pathway was activated prior to infection. vDCP-NB–like structures were also present in neurons of latently infected human TGs, designating PML-NBs as major nuclear components involved in the control of HSV-1 latency for the entire life of an individual.

"In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria communicate with chemical signal molecules called autoinducers to control collective behaviors. In pathogenic vibrios, including Vibrio cholerae, the accumulation of autoinducers triggers repression of genes responsible for virulence factor production and biofilm formation. The vibrio autoinducer molecules bind to transmembrane receptors of the two-component histidine sensor kinase family. Autoinducer binding inactivates the receptors’ kinase activities, leading to dephosphorylation and inhibition of the downstream response regulator LuxO. Here, we report the X-ray structure of LuxO in its unphosphorylated, autoinhibited state. Our structure reveals that LuxO, a bacterial enhancer-binding protein of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, is inhibited by an unprecedented mechanism in which a linker that connects the catalytic and regulatory receiver domains occupies the ATPase active site. The conformational change that accompanies receiver domain phosphorylation likely disrupts this interaction, providing a mechanistic rationale for LuxO activation. We also determined the crystal structure of the LuxO catalytic domain bound to a broad-spectrum inhibitor. The inhibitor binds in the ATPase active site and recapitulates elements of the natural regulatory mechanism. Remarkably, a single inhibitor molecule may be capable of inhibiting an entire LuxO oligomer.
","Bacteria communicate with one another and orchestrate group behaviors using a process called quorum sensing. The types of behaviors controlled by quorum sensing are typically unproductive when performed by a single bacterium acting alone but become effective when undertaken in unison by the group. Importantly, quorum sensing controls virulence and biofilm formation in many globally important pathogens. Thus, small molecules that modulate quorum sensing could be promising new antimicrobials. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to study LuxO, the central quorum sensing regulator in Vibrio cholerae and related bacteria. We find that LuxO activity is controlled during quorum sensing by a mechanism that entails occlusion of the LuxO active site by a linker region within the protein. The small molecule AzaU also inhibits LuxO and, in so doing, down-regulates V. cholerae virulence. Our studies show that AzaU binds to the LuxO active site, unexpectedly mimicking aspects of the natural regulatory mechanism.

"For efficient polarity and migration, cells need to regulate the magnitude and spatial distribution of actin assembly. This process is coordinated by reciprocal interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and mechanical forces. Actin polymerization-based protrusion increases tension in the plasma membrane, which in turn acts as a long-range inhibitor of actin assembly. These interactions form a negative feedback circuit that limits the magnitude of membrane tension in neutrophils and prevents expansion of the existing front and the formation of secondary fronts. It has been suggested that the plasma membrane directly inhibits actin assembly by serving as a physical barrier that opposes protrusion. Here we show that efficient control of actin polymerization-based protrusion requires an additional mechanosensory feedback cascade that indirectly links membrane tension with actin assembly. Specifically, elevated membrane tension acts through phospholipase D2 (PLD2) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) to limit actin nucleation. In the absence of this pathway, neutrophils exhibit larger leading edges, higher membrane tension, and profoundly defective chemotaxis. Mathematical modeling suggests roles for both the direct (mechanical) and indirect (biochemical via PLD2 and mTORC2) feedback loops in organizing cell polarity and motility—the indirect loop is better suited to enable competition between fronts, whereas the direct loop helps spatially organize actin nucleation for efficient leading edge formation and cell movement. This circuit is essential for polarity, motility, and the control of membrane tension.
","How cells regulate the size and number of their protrusions for efficient polarity and motility is a fundamental question in cell biology. We recently found that immune cells known as neutrophils use physical forces to regulate this process. Actin polymerization-based protrusion stretches the plasma membrane, and this increased membrane tension acts as a long-range inhibitor of actin-based protrusions elsewhere in the cell. Here we investigate how membrane tension limits protrusion. We demonstrate that the magnitude of actin network assembly in neutrophils is determined by a mechanosensory biochemical cascade that converts increases in membrane tension into decreases in protrusion. Specifically, we show that increasing plasma membrane tension acts through a pathway containing the phospholipase D2 (PLD2) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) to limit actin network assembly. Without this negative feedback pathway, neutrophils exhibit larger leading edges, higher membrane tension, and profoundly defective chemotaxis. Mathematical modeling indicates that this feedback circuit is a favorable topology to enable competition between protrusions during neutrophil polarization. Our work shows how biochemical signals, physical forces, and the cytoskeleton can collaborate to generate large-scale cellular organization.

"People learn modality-independent, conceptual representations from modality-specific sensory signals. Here, we hypothesize that any system that accomplishes this feat will include three components: a representational language for characterizing modality-independent representations, a set of sensory-specific forward models for mapping from modality-independent representations to sensory signals, and an inference algorithm for inverting forward models—that is, an algorithm for using sensory signals to infer modality-independent representations. To evaluate this hypothesis, we instantiate it in the form of a computational model that learns object shape representations from visual and/or haptic signals. The model uses a probabilistic grammar to characterize modality-independent representations of object shape, uses a computer graphics toolkit and a human hand simulator to map from object representations to visual and haptic features, respectively, and uses a Bayesian inference algorithm to infer modality-independent object representations from visual and/or haptic signals. Simulation results show that the model infers identical object representations when an object is viewed, grasped, or both. That is, the model’s percepts are modality invariant. We also report the results of an experiment in which different subjects rated the similarity of pairs of objects in different sensory conditions, and show that the model provides a very accurate account of subjects’ ratings. Conceptually, this research significantly contributes to our understanding of modality invariance, an important type of perceptual constancy, by demonstrating how modality-independent representations can be acquired and used. Methodologically, it provides an important contribution to cognitive modeling, particularly an emerging probabilistic language-of-thought approach, by showing how symbolic and statistical approaches can be combined in order to understand aspects of human perception.
","When viewing an object, people perceive the object’s shape. Similarly, when grasping the same object, they also perceive its shape. In general, the perceived shape is identical in these two scenarios, illustrating modality invariance, an important type of perceptual constancy. Modality invariance suggests that people infer a modality-independent, conceptual representation that is the same regardless of the modality used to sense the environment. If so, how do people infer modality-independent representations from modality-specific sensory signals? We present a hypothesis about the components that any system will include if it infers modality-independent representations from sensory signals. This hypothesis is instantiated in a computational model that infers object shape representations from visual or haptic (i.e., active touch) signals. The model shows perfect modality invariance—it infers the same shape representations regardless of the sensory modality used to sense objects. The model also provides a highly accurate account of data collected in an experiment in which people judged the similarity of pairs of objects that were viewed, grasped, or both. Conceptually, our research contributes to our understanding of modality invariance. Methodologically, it contributes to cognitive modeling by showing how symbolic and statistical approaches can be combined in order to understand aspects of human perception.

"Since the first discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents along the Galápagos Rift in 1977, numerous vent sites and endemic faunal assemblages have been found along mid-ocean ridges and back-arc basins at low to mid latitudes. These discoveries have suggested the existence of separate biogeographic provinces in the Atlantic and the North West Pacific, the existence of a province including the South West Pacific and Indian Ocean, and a separation of the North East Pacific, North East Pacific Rise, and South East Pacific Rise. The Southern Ocean is known to be a region of high deep-sea species diversity and centre of origin for the global deep-sea fauna. It has also been proposed as a gateway connecting hydrothermal vents in different oceans but is little explored because of extreme conditions. Since 2009 we have explored two segments of the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) in the Southern Ocean using a remotely operated vehicle. In each segment we located deep-sea hydrothermal vents hosting high-temperature black smokers up to 382.8°C and diffuse venting. The chemosynthetic ecosystems hosted by these vents are dominated by a new yeti crab (Kiwa n. sp.), stalked barnacles, limpets, peltospiroid gastropods, anemones, and a predatory sea star. Taxa abundant in vent ecosystems in other oceans, including polychaete worms (Siboglinidae), bathymodiolid mussels, and alvinocaridid shrimps, are absent from the ESR vents. These groups, except the Siboglinidae, possess planktotrophic larvae, rare in Antarctic marine invertebrates, suggesting that the environmental conditions of the Southern Ocean may act as a dispersal filter for vent taxa. Evidence from the distinctive fauna, the unique community structure, and multivariate analyses suggest that the Antarctic vent ecosystems represent a new vent biogeographic province. However, multivariate analyses of species present at the ESR and at other deep-sea hydrothermal vents globally indicate that vent biogeography is more complex than previously recognised.
","Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are mainly associated with seafloor spreading at mid-ocean ridges and in basins near volcanic island arcs. They host animals found nowhere else that derive their energy not from the sun but from bacterial oxidation of chemicals in the vent fluids, particularly hydrogen sulphide. Hydrothermal vents and their communities of organisms have become important models for understanding the origins and limits of life as well as evolution of island-like communities in the deep ocean. We describe the fauna associated with high-temperature hydrothermal vents on the East Scotia Ridge, Southern Ocean, to our knowledge the first to be discovered in Antarctic waters. These communities are dominated by a new species of yeti crab, stalked barnacles, limpets and snails, sea anemones, and a predatory seven-armed starfish. Animals commonly found in hydrothermal vents of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, including giant Riftia tubeworms, annelid worms, vent mussels, vent crabs, and vent shrimps, were not present at the Southern Ocean vents. These discoveries suggest that the environmental conditions of the Southern Ocean may act as a barrier to some vent animals and that the East Scotia Ridge communities form a new biogeographic province with a unique species composition and structure.

"A major component of obesity-related insulin resistance is the establishment of a chronic inflammatory state with invasion of white adipose tissue by mononuclear cells. This results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn leads to insulin resistance in target tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver. To determine the role of insulin action in macrophages and monocytes in obesity-associated insulin resistance, we conditionally inactivated the insulin receptor (IR) gene in myeloid lineage cells in mice (IRΔmyel-mice). While these animals exhibit unaltered glucose metabolism on a normal diet, they are protected from the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance upon high fat feeding. Euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp studies demonstrate that this results from decreased basal hepatic glucose production and from increased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, IRΔmyel-mice exhibit decreased concentrations of circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and thus reduced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in skeletal muscle upon high fat feeding, reflecting a dramatic reduction of the chronic and systemic low-grade inflammatory state associated with obesity. This is paralleled by a reduced accumulation of macrophages in white adipose tissue due to a pronounced impairment of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 expression and activity in these cells. These data indicate that insulin action in myeloid cells plays an unexpected, critical role in the regulation of macrophage invasion into white adipose tissue and in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance.
","Obesity represents a major health burden with steadily increasing incidence. While it is associated with numerous co-morbidities, type 2 diabetes mellitus represents one of the major life-threatening, obesity-related conditions. Over the last years, it has become clear that during the course of obesity development not only does fat mass increase, but also fat composition changes qualitatively, leading to an influx of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, into adipose tissue. Macrophages in turn secrete inflammatory mediators, which inhibit insulin action in skeletal muscle, liver, and even the central nervous system to ultimately cause insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. However, the effect of insulin action and resistance in these inflammatory cell types themselves has not been addressed. To this end, we have generated and analyzed mice with inactivation of the insulin receptor specifically in myeloid cell-derived, inflammatory cells. Surprisingly, these animals are protected from the development of obesity-associated deterioration of glucose metabolism, thereby defining insulin action in inflammatory cells as a novel and promising target for therapeutic intervention against obesity-associated diabetes mellitus.

"Yaws is a non-venereal treponemal infection caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue. The WHO has launched a worldwide control programme, which aims to eradicate yaws by 2020. The development of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for serological diagnosis in the isolated communities affected by yaws is a key requirement for the successful implementation of the WHO strategy. We conducted a study to evaluate the utility of the DPP test in screening for yaws, utilizing samples collected as part of a community prevalence survey conducted in the Solomon Islands. 415 serum samples were tested using both traditional syphilis serology (TPPA and quantitative RPR) and the Chembio DPP Syphilis Screen and Confirm RDT. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT as compared to gold standard serology. The sensitivity of the RDT against TPPA was 58.5% and the specificity was 97.6%. The sensitivity of the RDT against RPR was 41.7% and the specificity was 95.2%. The sensitivity of the DPP was strongly related to the RPR titre with a sensitivity of 92.0% for an RPR titre of >1/16. Wider access to DPP testing would improve our understanding of worldwide yaws case reporting and the test may play a key role in assessing patients presenting with yaws like lesions in a post-mass drug administration (MDA) setting.
","Yaws is a bacterial infection closely related to syphilis. The WHO has launched a worldwide campaign to eradicate yaws by 2020. If this goal is to be achieved, programme managers and clinical staff will need access to a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for yaws that can be used in the remote communities where the disease is found. In this study, we present data evaluating one possible RDT for yaws as part of a community survey in the Solomon Islands. The test performed reasonably well—there were some false negatives but few false positives. The performance of the test was best in individuals with more active disease suggesting the test may be most appropriately used for confirming clinically diagnosed cases. These findings should prompt consideration of the use of this RDT as part of worldwide yaws control efforts.

"Influenza A virus (IAV) defective RNAs are generated as byproducts of error-prone viral RNA replication. They are commonly derived from the larger segments of the viral genome and harbor deletions of various sizes resulting in the generation of replication incompatible viral particles. Furthermore, small subgenomic RNAs are known to be strong inducers of pattern recognition receptor RIG-I-dependent type I interferon (IFN) responses. The present study identifies a novel IAV-induced defective RNA derived from the PB2 segment of A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004 (H5N1). It encodes a 10 kDa protein (PB2∆) sharing the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the parental PB2 protein followed by frame shift after internal deletion. PB2∆ induces the expression of IFNβ and IFN-stimulated genes by direct interaction with the cellular adapter protein MAVS, thereby reducing viral replication of IFN-sensitive viruses such as IAV or vesicular stomatitis virus. This induction of IFN is completely independent of the defective RNA itself that usually serves as pathogen-associated pattern and thus does not require the cytoplasmic sensor RIG-I. These data suggest that not only defective RNAs, but also some defective RNA-encoded proteins can act immunostimulatory. In this particular case, the KAN-1-induced defective RNA-encoded protein PB2∆ enhances the overwhelming immune response characteristic for highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, leading to a more severe phenotype in vivo.
","Error-prone polymerase function of RNA viruses can result in expression of defective RNAs harboring internal deletions of various sizes. Small subgenomic RNAs are strong inducers of the antiviral response by serving as pathogen-associated patterns that are predominantly detected by cellular sensors. Recently, it has been shown that influenza A virus defective RNAs are not only generated upon passages in cell culture, but also in infected humans, indicating that these subgenomic RNAs may also be relevant in infections in vivo. Here, we characterize a novel defective RNA derived from the PB2 segment of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. This RNA encodes a 10 kDa peptide (PB2Δ) which activates type I interferon (IFN) responses through direct interaction with the adapter protein MAVS, a key component of the RIG-I-dependent IFN induction. This is the first time that such a function was described for a defective RNA-encoded protein, a finding that has several important implications with regard to deciphering viral protein functions and options for immunostimulatory approaches. Furthermore, this is an example of how influenza viruses may acquire novel polypeptides with altered functions from its limited genome.

"Germline stem cells in the Drosophila ovary are maintained by a somatic niche. The niche is structurally and functionally complex and contains four cell types, the escort, cap, and terminal filament cells and the newly identified transition cell. We find that the large Maf transcription factor Traffic jam (Tj) is essential for determining niche cell fates and architecture, enabling each niche in the ovary to support a normal complement of 2–3 germline stem cells. In particular, we focused on the question of how cap cells form. Cap cells express Tj and are considered the key component of a mature germline stem cell niche. We conclude that Tj controls the specification of cap cells, as the complete loss of Tj function caused the development of additional terminal filament cells at the expense of cap cells, and terminal filament cells developed cap cell characteristics when induced to express Tj. Further, we propose that Tj controls the morphogenetic behavior of cap cells as they adopted the shape and spatial organization of terminal filament cells but otherwise appeared to retain their fate when Tj expression was only partially reduced. Our data indicate that Tj contributes to the establishment of germline stem cells by promoting the cap cell fate, and controls the stem cell-carrying capacity of the niche by regulating niche architecture. Analysis of the interactions between Tj and the Notch (N) pathway indicates that Tj and N have distinct functions in the cap cell specification program. We propose that formation of cap cells depends on the combined activities of Tj and the N pathway, with Tj promoting the cap cell fate by blocking the terminal filament cell fate, and N supporting cap cells by preventing the escort cell fate and/or controlling the number of cap cell precursors.
","Establishment and maintenance of stem cells often depends on associated niche cells. The germline stem cell niche of the Drosophila ovary has been a long-standing model for the analysis of the interactions between stem cells and niche cells. Surprisingly little is known, however, about the mechanisms that pattern this niche, leading to the specification of different niche cell types and to their distinct arrangement around the stem cells. The observation that Tj is expressed at different levels in the different cell types of the niche motivated us to ask what contribution this transcription factor makes to the formation of the niche. Our data suggest that Tj activity is needed for the presence of escort cells and for the correct specification of cap cells but appears to be dispensable for the formation of terminal filament cells in the germline stem cell niche. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the establishment of the cap cell fate depends on the cooperation between Tj and the N signaling pathway. We conclude that Tj regulates the germline stem cell carrying capacity of the niche by controlling the fate and the spatial arrangement of niche cells.

"Aedes aegypti poses a serious risk to human health due to its wide global distribution, high vector competence for several arboviruses, frequent human biting, and ability to thrive in urban environments. Pyrethroid insecticides remain the primary means of controlling adult A. aegypti populations during disease outbreaks. As a result of decades of use, pyrethroid resistance is a global problem. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP)-mediated detoxification is one of the primary mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance. However, the specific CYP(s) responsible for resistance have not been unequivocally determined. We introgressed the resistance alleles from the resistant A. aegypti strain, Singapore (SP), into the genetic background of the susceptible ROCK strain. The resulting strain (CKR) was congenic to ROCK. Our primary goal was to determine which CYPs in SP are linked to resistance. To do this, we first determined which CYPs overexpressed in SP are also overexpressed in CKR, with the assumption that only the CYPs linked to resistance will be overexpressed in CKR relative to ROCK. Next, we determined whether any of the overexpressed CYPs were genetically linked to resistance (cis-regulated) or not (trans-regulated). We found that CYP6BB2, CYP6Z8, CYP9M5 and CYP9M6 were overexpressed in SP as well as in CKR. Based on the genomic sequences and polymorphisms of five single copy CYPs (CYP4C50, 6BB2, 6F2, 6F3 and 6Z8) in each strain, none of these genes were linked to resistance, except for CYP6BB2, which was partially linked to the resistance locus. Hence, overexpression of these four CYPs is due to a trans-regulatory factor(s). Knowledge on the specific CYPs and their regulators involved in resistance is critical for resistance management strategies because it aids in the development of new control chemicals, provides information on potential environmental modulators of resistance, and allows for the detection of resistance markers before resistance becomes fixed in the population.
","Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are one of the most important mechanism of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. These CYP enzymes break down insecticides into non-toxic forms that can be readily excreted. An increase of CYP-mediated detoxification is commonly found in pyrethroid resistant Aedes aegypti, however the link between specific CYPs and the resistance loci have not been clearly established for this species. In this study, we measured the expression levels of nine candidate CYPs in two strains highly resistant to permethrin: SP, a field collected strain that was selected with permethrin for high levels of resistance and CKR, a strain that contains the resistance mechanisms from SP, but that is congenic (i.e. has the genetic background) to the insecticide susceptible strain, ROCK. We found seven overexpressed CYPs in SP and four in CKR, confirming their involvement in resistance. Next, we sequenced the CYP genes (with the exception of the duplicated ones) to determine if the genes themselves are located in the resistance locus (meaning their expression is cis-regulated) or not (meaning their expression is trans-regulated). We found no reduced polymorphisms in any of the resistant strain (SP) CYPs, suggesting that the overexpression of these CYPs (and thus CYP-mediated resistance) is trans-regulated.

"Networks play a crucial role in computational biology, yet their analysis and representation is still an open problem. Power Graph Analysis is a lossless transformation of biological networks into a compact, less redundant representation, exploiting the abundance of cliques and bicliques as elementary topological motifs. We demonstrate with five examples the advantages of Power Graph Analysis. Investigating protein-protein interaction networks, we show how the catalytic subunits of the casein kinase II complex are distinguishable from the regulatory subunits, how interaction profiles and sequence phylogeny of SH3 domains correlate, and how false positive interactions among high-throughput interactions are spotted. Additionally, we demonstrate the generality of Power Graph Analysis by applying it to two other types of networks. We show how power graphs induce a clustering of both transcription factors and target genes in bipartite transcription networks, and how the erosion of a phosphatase domain in type 22 non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases is detected. We apply Power Graph Analysis to high-throughput protein interaction networks and show that up to 85% (56% on average) of the information is redundant. Experimental networks are more compressible than rewired ones of same degree distribution, indicating that experimental networks are rich in cliques and bicliques. Power Graphs are a novel representation of networks, which reduces network complexity by explicitly representing re-occurring network motifs. Power Graphs compress up to 85% of the edges in protein interaction networks and are applicable to all types of networks such as protein interactions, regulatory networks, or homology networks.
","Networks play a crucial role in biology and are often used as a way to represent experimental results. Yet, their analysis and representation is still an open problem. Recent experimental and computational progress yields networks of increased size and complexity. There are, for example, small- and large-scale interaction networks, regulatory networks, genetic networks, protein-ligand interaction networks, and homology networks analyzed and published regularly. A common way to access the information in a network is though direct visualization, but this fails as it often just results in “fur balls” from which little insight can be gathered. On the other hand, clustering techniques manage to avoid the problems caused by the large number of nodes and even larger number of edges by coarse-graining the networks and thus abstracting details. But these also fail, since, in fact, much of the biology lies in the details. This work presents a novel methodology for analyzing and representing networks. Power Graphs are a lossless representation of networks, which reduces network complexity by explicitly representing re-occurring network motifs. Moreover, power graphs can be clearly visualized: they compress up to 90% of the edges in biological networks and are applicable to all types of networks such as protein interaction, regulatory networks, or homology networks.

"Plasmodium knowlesi is now recognised as a leading cause of malaria in Malaysia. As humans come into increasing contact with the reservoir host (long-tailed macaques) as a consequence of deforestation, assessing the potential for a shift from zoonotic to sustained P. knowlesi transmission between humans is critical.
A multi-host, multi-site transmission model was developed, taking into account the three areas (forest, farm, and village) where transmission is thought to occur. Latin hypercube sampling of model parameters was used to identify parameter sets consistent with possible prevalence in macaques and humans inferred from observed data. We then explore the consequences of increasing human-macaque contact in the farm, the likely impact of rapid treatment, and the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in preventing wider spread of this emerging infection.
Identified model parameters were consistent with transmission being sustained by the macaques with spill over infections into the human population and with high overall basic reproduction numbers (up to 2267). The extent to which macaques forage in the farms had a non-linear relationship with human infection prevalence, the highest prevalence occurring when macaques forage in the farms but return frequently to the forest where they experience higher contact with vectors and hence sustain transmission. Only one of 1,046 parameter sets was consistent with sustained human-to-human transmission in the absence of macaques, although with a low human reproduction number (R0H = 1.04). Simulations showed LLINs and rapid treatment provide personal protection to humans with maximal estimated reductions in human prevalence of 42% and 95%, respectively.
This model simulates conditions where P. knowlesi transmission may occur and the potential impact of control measures. Predictions suggest that conventional control measures are sufficient at reducing the risk of infection in humans, but they must be actively implemented if P. knowlesi is to be controlled.
","Plasmodium knowlesi is a malaria of macaques which is now recognised as a leading cause of human malaria in Malaysia. Although current human infections are a result of human-macaque contact, there is a potential for P. knowlesi to be transmitted solely among humans. The authors developed a multi-host, multi-site transmission model to assess the likelihood of this happening due to increased human-macaque contact as a consequence of deforestation, population growth, and land-use change. How effective currently available malaria control measures were against P. knowlesi was also an important issue that was explored using the model. Although the model predicts that conventional control measures will be sufficient against P. knowlesi, with the push to eliminate malaria by the end of 2015, it is crucial to be aware of zoonotic malarias which may undermine such efforts.

"Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells have emerged as a powerful immunotherapy for various forms of cancer and show promise in treating HIV-1 infection. However, significant limitations are persistence and whether peripheral T cell-based products can respond to malignant or infected cells that may reappear months or years after treatment remains unclear. Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) are capable of long-term engraftment and have the potential to overcome these limitations. Here, we report the use of a protective CD4 chimeric antigen receptor (C46CD4CAR) to redirect HSPC-derived T-cells against simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in pigtail macaques. CAR-containing cells persisted for more than 2 years without any measurable toxicity and were capable of multilineage engraftment. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) treatment followed by cART withdrawal resulted in lower viral rebound in CAR animals relative to controls, and demonstrated an immune memory-like response. We found CAR-expressing cells in multiple lymphoid tissues, decreased tissue-associated SHIV RNA levels, and substantially higher CD4/CD8 ratios in the gut as compared to controls. These results show that HSPC-derived CAR T-cells are capable of long-term engraftment and immune surveillance. This study demonstrates for the first time the safety and feasibility of HSPC-based CAR therapy in a large animal preclinical model.
","Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cell (HSPC) based gene therapy can be used to treat many infectious and genetic diseases. Here, we used an HSPC-based approach to redirect and enhance host immunity against HIV-1. We engineered HSPCs to carry chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) genes that detect and destroy HIV-infected cells. CAR therapy has shown huge potential in the treatment of cancer, but has only been applied in peripheral blood T-cells. HSPC-based CAR therapy has several benefits over T cell gene therapy, as it allows for normal T cell development, selection, and persistence of the engineered cells for the lifetime of the patient. We used a CAR molecule that hijacks the essential interaction between the virus and the cell surface molecule CD4 to redirect HSPC-derived T-cells against infected cells. We observed >2 years of stable production of CAR-expressing cells without any adverse events, and wide distribution of these cells in lymphoid tissues and gastrointestinal tract, which are major anatomic sites for HIV replication and persistence in suppressed patients. Most importantly, HSPC-derived CAR T-cells functionally responded to infected cells. This study demonstrates for the first time the safety and feasibility of HSPC based therapy utilizing an HIV-specific CAR for suppressed HIV infection.

"Transcription factors are grouped into families based on sequence similarity within functional domains, particularly DNA-binding domains. The Specificity proteins Sp1, Sp2 and Sp3 are paradigmatic of closely related transcription factors. They share amino-terminal glutamine-rich regions and a conserved carboxy-terminal zinc finger domain that can bind to GC rich motifs in vitro. All three Sp proteins are ubiquitously expressed; yet they carry out unique functions in vivo raising the question of how specificity is achieved. Crucially, it is unknown whether they bind to distinct genomic sites and, if so, how binding site selection is accomplished. In this study, we have examined the genomic binding patterns of Sp1, Sp2 and Sp3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts by ChIP-seq. Sp1 and Sp3 essentially occupy the same promoters and localize to GC boxes. The genomic binding pattern of Sp2 is different; Sp2 primarily localizes at CCAAT motifs. Consistently, re-expression of Sp2 and Sp3 mutants in corresponding knockout MEFs revealed strikingly different modes of genomic binding site selection. Most significantly, while the zinc fingers dictate genomic binding of Sp3, they are completely dispensable for binding of Sp2. Instead, the glutamine-rich amino-terminal region is sufficient for recruitment of Sp2 to its target promoters in vivo. We have identified the trimeric histone-fold CCAAT box binding transcription factor Nf-y as the major partner for Sp2-chromatin interaction. Nf-y is critical for recruitment of Sp2 to co-occupied regulatory elements. Equally, Sp2 potentiates binding of Nf-y to shared sites indicating the existence of an extensive Sp2-Nf-y interaction network. Our results unveil strikingly different recruitment mechanisms of Sp1/Sp2/Sp3 transcription factor members uncovering an unexpected layer of complexity in their binding to chromatin in vivo.
","A major question in eukaryotic gene regulation is how transcription factors with similar structural features elicit specific biological responses. We used the three transcription factors Sp1, Sp2 and Sp3 as a paradigm for investigating this question. All three proteins are ubiquitously expressed, and they share glutamine-rich domains as well as a conserved bona fide zinc finger DNA binding domain. Yet, each of the three proteins carries out unique functions in vivo, and each is absolutely essential for mouse development. By genome-wide binding analysis, we found that Sp1 and Sp3 on the one hand, and Sp2 on the other hand engage completely different protein domains for their genomic binding site selection. Most strikingly, the zinc finger domain of Sp2 is dispensable for recruitment to its target sites in vivo. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that the histone-fold protein Nf-y is necessary for recruitment of Sp2. Conversely, Sp2 potentiates Nf-y binding showing that binding of Sp2 and Nf-y to shared sites is mutually dependent. Our findings uncover an unexpected mechanistic diversity in promoter recognition by seemingly similar transcription factors. This work has broader implications for our understanding of how members of other multi-protein transcription factor families could achieve specificity.

"Metabolic control of gene expression coordinates the levels of specific gene products to meet cellular demand for their activities. This control can be exerted by metabolites acting as regulatory signals and/or a class of metabolic enzymes with dual functions as regulators of gene expression. However, little is known about how metabolic signals affect the balance between enzymatic and regulatory roles of these dual functional proteins. We previously described the RNA binding activity of a 63 kDa chloroplast protein from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which has been implicated in expression of the psbA mRNA, encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II. Here, we identify this factor as dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (DLA2), a subunit of the chloroplast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (cpPDC), which is known to provide acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. Analyses of RNAi lines revealed that DLA2 is involved in the synthesis of both D1 and acetyl-CoA. Gel filtration analyses demonstrated an RNP complex containing DLA2 and the chloroplast psbA mRNA specifically in cells metabolizing acetate. An intrinsic RNA binding activity of DLA2 was confirmed by in vitro RNA binding assays. Results of fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation experiments support a role of DLA2 in acetate-dependent localization of the psbA mRNA to a translation zone within the chloroplast. Reciprocally, the activity of the cpPDC was specifically affected by binding of psbA mRNA. Beyond that, in silico analysis and in vitro RNA binding studies using recombinant proteins support the possibility that RNA binding is an ancient feature of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferases. Our results suggest a regulatory function of DLA2 in response to growth on reduced carbon energy sources. This raises the intriguing possibility that this regulation functions to coordinate the synthesis of lipids and proteins for the biogenesis of photosynthetic membranes.

These findings offer insight into how intracellular metabolic signaling and gene expression are reciprocally regulated during membrane biogenesis. In addition, our results suggest that these dual roles of the protein might exist in evolutionary distant organisms ranging from cyanobacteria to humans.

"Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. While no licensed therapeutics are available, recently there has been tremendous progress in developing antivirals. Targeting the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) proteins, which facilitate genome replication and transcription, and particularly the polymerase L, is a promising antiviral approach since these processes are essential for the virus life cycle. However, until now little is known about L in terms of its structure and function, and in particular the catalytic center of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of L, which is one of the most promising molecular targets, has never been experimentally characterized.
Using multiple sequence alignments with other negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses we identified the putative catalytic center of the EBOV RdRp. An L protein with mutations in this center was then generated and characterized using various life cycle modelling systems. These systems are based on minigenomes, i.e. miniature versions of the viral genome, in which the viral genes are exchanged against a reporter gene. When such minigenomes are coexpressed with RNP proteins in mammalian cells, the RNP proteins recognize them as authentic templates for replication and transcription, resulting in reporter activity reflecting these processes. Replication-competent minigenome systems indicated that our L catalytic domain mutant was impaired in genome replication and/or transcription, and by using replication-deficient minigenome systems, as well as a novel RT-qPCR-based genome replication assay, we showed that it indeed no longer supported either of these processes. However, it still showed similar expression to wild-type L, and retained its ability to be incorporated into inclusion bodies, which are the sites of EBOV genome replication.
We have experimentally defined the catalytic center of the EBOV RdRp, and thus a promising antiviral target regulating an essential aspect of the EBOV life cycle.
","Ebola viruses cause severe hemorrhagic fevers, and were responsible for the devastating Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa from 2013 to 2016. While a number of experimental therapeutics against these viruses target the viral polymerase, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge regarding this essential viral protein. In particular, until now no experimental evidence has been provided identifying the catalytic center of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is absolutely essential for the virus life cycle due to its role in replicating and transcribing the viral negative-sense RNA genome. Based on a comparison to related negative-sense RNA viruses from other virus families we identified a putative catalytic center within the Ebola virus polymerase, and provide the experimental evidence that the Ebola virus polymerase indeed utilizes a classical GDNQ motif for both genome replication and transcription. This finding not only increases our knowledge regarding the molecular biology of Ebola viruses, but also defines a molecular target for the development of antivirals against this deadly virus.

"Plant volatiles play important roles in attraction of certain pollinators and in host location by herbivorous insects. Virus infection induces changes in plant volatile emission profiles, and this can make plants more attractive to insect herbivores, such as aphids, that act as viral vectors. However, it is unknown if virus-induced alterations in volatile production affect plant-pollinator interactions. We found that volatiles emitted by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants altered the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Virus-induced quantitative and qualitative changes in blends of volatile organic compounds emitted by tomato plants were identified by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Experiments with a CMV mutant unable to express the 2b RNA silencing suppressor protein and with Arabidopsis silencing mutants implicate microRNAs in regulating emission of pollinator-perceivable volatiles. In tomato, CMV infection made plants emit volatiles attractive to bumblebees. Bumblebees pollinate tomato by ‘buzzing’ (sonicating) the flowers, which releases pollen and enhances self-fertilization and seed production as well as pollen export. Without buzz-pollination, CMV infection decreased seed yield, but when flowers of mock-inoculated and CMV-infected plants were buzz-pollinated, the increased seed yield for CMV-infected plants was similar to that for mock-inoculated plants. Increased pollinator preference can potentially increase plant reproductive success in two ways: i) as female parents, by increasing the probability that ovules are fertilized; ii) as male parents, by increasing pollen export. Mathematical modeling suggested that over a wide range of conditions in the wild, these increases to the number of offspring of infected susceptible plants resulting from increased pollinator preference could outweigh underlying strong selection pressures favoring pathogen resistance, allowing genes for disease susceptibility to persist in plant populations. We speculate that enhanced pollinator service for infected individuals in wild plant populations might provide mutual benefits to the virus and its susceptible hosts.
","Cucumber mosaic virus, an important pathogen of tomato, causes plants to emit volatile chemicals that attract bumblebees. Bumblebees are important tomato pollinators, but do not transmit this virus. We propose that under natural conditions, helping host reproduction by encouraging bee visitation might represent a ‘payback’ by the virus to susceptible hosts. Although tomato flowers can give rise to seed through self-fertilization, bumblebee-mediated ‘buzz-pollination’ enhances this, increasing the number of seeds produced per fruit. Buzz-pollination further favors reproductive success of a plant by facilitating pollen export. Mathematical modeling suggests that if self-fertilization by infected plants, as well as pollen transfer from these plants (cross-fertilization) to surrounding plants is increased, this might favor reproduction of susceptible over that of resistant plants. This raises the possibility that under natural conditions some viruses might enhance competitiveness of susceptible plants and inhibit the emergence of resistant plant strains. We speculate that it may be in a virus’ interest to pay back a susceptible host by enhancing its attractiveness to pollinators, which will likely increase fertilization rates and the dissemination of susceptible plant pollen and may compensate for a decreased yield of seeds on the virus-infected plants.

"Zoonotic pathogens such as Ebola and rabies pose a major health risk to humans. One proven approach to minimizing the impact of a pathogen relies on reducing its prevalence within animal reservoir populations using mass vaccination. However, two major challenges remain for vaccination programs that target free-ranging animal populations. First, limited or challenging access to wild hosts, and second, expenses associated with purchasing and distributing the vaccine. Together, these challenges constrain a campaign’s ability to maintain adequate levels of immunity in the host population for an extended period of time. Transmissible vaccines could lessen these constraints, improving our ability to both establish and maintain herd immunity in free-ranging animal populations. Because the extent to which vaccine transmission could augment current wildlife vaccination campaigns is unknown, we develop and parameterize a mathematical model that describes long-term mass vaccination campaigns in the US that target rabies in wildlife. The model is used to investigate the ability of a weakly transmissible vaccine to (1) increase vaccine coverage in campaigns that fail to immunize at levels required for herd immunity, and (2) decrease the expense of campaigns that achieve herd immunity. When parameterized to efforts that target rabies in raccoons using vaccine baits, our model indicates that, with current vaccination efforts, a vaccine that transmits to even one additional host per vaccinated individual could sufficiently augment US efforts to preempt the spread of the rabies virus. Higher levels of transmission are needed, however, when spatial heterogeneities associated with flight-line vaccination are incorporated into the model. In addition to augmenting deficient campaigns, our results show that weak vaccine transmission can reduce the costs of vaccination campaigns that are successful in attaining herd immunity.
","Zoonotic pathogens pose a significant health risk to humans. Mass vaccination programs have shown promise for controlling zoonoses in reservoir populations and, in turn, lessening the health burden posed to neighboring human populations. Despite some significant successes, major logistical challenges remain for programs that seek to establish and maintain herd immunity in free-ranging animal populations. Specifically, limited host access and costs associated with vaccine distribution may hinder efforts to vaccinate a host population and preempt spillover of a zoonotic pathogen. We use mathematical models, parameterized with data from campaigns in the US that target rabies in wildlife, to illustrate how transmissible vaccines can overcome these challenges. Specifically, we find levels of vaccine transmission necessary to boost vaccination efforts that seek to preempt the spread of rabies, and also predict the cost savings that could be realized with a transmissible vaccine.

"Most of the Leishmania genome is reported to be
                        constitutively expressed during the life cycle of the parasite, with a few
                        regulated genes. Inter-species comparative transcriptomics evidenced a low
                        number of species-specific differences related to differentially distributed
                        genes or the differential regulation of conserved genes. It is of uppermost
                        importance to ensure that the observed differences are indeed
                        species-specific and not simply specific of the strains selected for
                        representing the species. The relevance of this concern is illustrated by
                        current study.
We selected 5 clinical isolates of L. braziliensis
                        characterized by their diversity of clinical and in vitro
                        phenotypes. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on promastigote and
                        amastigote life stages to assess gene expression profiles at seven time
                        points covering the whole life cycle. We tested 12 genes encoding proteins
                        with roles in transport, thiol-based redox metabolism, cellular reduction,
                        RNA poly(A)-tail metabolism, cytoskeleton function and ribosomal function.
                        The general trend of expression profiles showed that regulation of gene
                        expression essentially occurs around the stationary phase of promastigotes.
                        However, the genes involved in this phenomenon appeared to vary
                        significantly among the isolates considered.
Our results clearly illustrate the unique character of each isolate in terms
                        of gene expression dynamics. Results obtained on an individual strain are
                        not necessarily representative of a given species. Therefore, extreme care
                        should be taken when comparing the profiles of different species and
                        extrapolating functional differences between them.
","Leishmania is a group of parasites (Protozoa, Trypanosomatidae)
                    responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical forms. Among the factors explaining
                    this phenotypic polymorphism, parasite features are important contributors. One
                    approach to identify them consists in characterizing the gene expression
                    profiles throughout the life cycle. In a recent study, the transcriptome of 3
                        Leishmania species was compared and this revealed
                    species-specific differences, albeit in a low number. A key issue, however, is
                    to ensure that the observed differences are indeed species-specific and not
                    specific of the strains selected for representing the species. In order to
                    illustrate the relevance of this concern, we analyzed here the gene expression
                    profiles of 5 clinical isolates of L. braziliensis at seven
                    time points of the life cycle. Our results clearly illustrate the unique
                    character of each isolate in terms of gene expression dynamics: one

"The Th-inducing POK (Th-POK, also known as ZBTB7B or cKrox) transcription factor is a key regulator of lineage commitment of immature T cell precursors. It is yet unclear the physiological functions of Th-POK besides helper T cell differentiation. Here we show that Th-POK is restrictedly expressed in the luminal epithelial cells in the mammary glands that is upregulated at late pregnancy and lactation. Lineage restrictedly expressed Th-POK exerts distinct biological functions in the mammary epithelial cells and T cells in a tissue-specific manner. Th-POK is not required for mammary epithelial cell fate determination. Mammary gland morphogenesis in puberty and alveologenesis in pregnancy are phenotypically normal in the Th-POK-deficient mice. However, Th-POK-deficient mice are defective in triggering the onset of lactation upon parturition with large cellular lipid droplets retained within alveolar epithelial cells. As a result, Th-POK knockout mice are unable to efficiently secret milk lipid and to nurse the offspring. Such defect is mainly attributed to the malfunctioned mammary epithelial cells, but not the tissue microenvironment in the Th-POK deficient mice. Th-POK directly regulates expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and insulin-induced Akt-mTOR-SREBP signaling. Th-POK deficiency compromises IRS-1 expression and Akt-mTOR-SREBP signaling in the lactating mammary glands. Conversely, insulin induces Th-POK expression. Thus, Th-POK functions as an important feed-forward regulator of insulin signaling in mammary gland lactation.
","Th-POK, aka cKrox or ZBTB7B, is a zinc finger transcription factor that specifies the cell fate of immature T cell precursors towards the CD4 lineage. It is yet largely unknown if Th-POK participates in the regulation of other biological processes. It is also not known if Th-POK functions beyond cell fate determination. In this study, we found that Th-POK is expressed in the luminal, but not the basal epithelial cells in the mammary glands. Despite the lineage restricted expression in the mammary glands, Th-POK is dispensable for mammary epithelial cell lineage specification and mammary gland development. Rather, Th-POK regulates the onset of lactation and milk lipid production via mammary epithelial cell autonomous mechanisms, suggesting that Th-POK exerts distinct functions in a tissue specific manner. Th-POK regulates the expression of insulin receptor sunstrate-1 and insulin-induced mTOR-SREBP pathway activation and lipid biosynthesis in the mammary alveolar cells at lactation. Thus, Th-POK functions as an important metabolic regulator in the lactating mammary glands, in addition to its well documented cell fate specification functions in T cell development.

"Information is encoded in neural circuits using both graded and action potentials, converting between them within single neurons and successive processing layers. This conversion is accompanied by information loss and a drop in energy efficiency. We investigate the biophysical causes of this loss of information and efficiency by comparing spiking neuron models, containing stochastic voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels, with generator potential and graded potential models lacking voltage-gated Na+ channels. We identify three causes of information loss in the generator potential that are the by-product of action potential generation: (1) the voltage-gated Na+ channels necessary for action potential generation increase intrinsic noise and (2) introduce non-linearities, and (3) the finite duration of the action potential creates a ‘footprint’ in the generator potential that obscures incoming signals. These three processes reduce information rates by ∼50% in generator potentials, to ∼3 times that of spike trains. Both generator potentials and graded potentials consume almost an order of magnitude less energy per second than spike trains. Because of the lower information rates of generator potentials they are substantially less energy efficient than graded potentials. However, both are an order of magnitude more efficient than spike trains due to the higher energy costs and low information content of spikes, emphasizing that there is a two-fold cost of converting analogue to digital; information loss and cost inflation.
","As in electronics, many of the brain's neural circuits convert continuous time signals into a discrete-time binary code. Although some neurons use only graded voltage signals, most convert these signals into discrete-time action potentials. Yet the costs and benefits associated with such a switch in signalling mechanism are largely unexplored. We investigate why the conversion of graded potentials to action potentials is accompanied by substantial information loss and how this changes energy efficiency. Action potentials are generated by a large cohort of noisy Na+ channels. We show that this channel noise and the added non-linearity of Na+ channels destroy input information provided by graded generator potentials. Furthermore, action potentials themselves cause information loss due to their finite widths because the neuron is oblivious to the input that is arriving during an action potential. Consequently, neurons with high firing rates lose a large amount of the information in their inputs. The additional cost incurred by voltage-gated Na+ channels also means that action potentials can encode less information per unit energy, proving metabolically inefficient, and suggesting penalisation of high firing rates in the nervous system.

"In 2010 and 2011, Haiti was heavily affected by a large cholera outbreak that spread throughout the country. Although national health structure-based cholera surveillance was rapidly initiated, a substantial number of community cases might have been missed, particularly in remote areas. We conducted a community-based survey in a large rural, mountainous area across four districts of the Nord department including areas with good versus poor accessibility by road, and rapid versus delayed response to the outbreak to document the true cholera burden and assess geographic distribution and risk factors for cholera mortality.
A two-stage, household-based cluster survey was conducted in 138 clusters of 23 households in four districts of the Nord Department from April 22nd to May 13th 2011. A total of 3,187 households and 16,900 individuals were included in the survey, of whom 2,034 (12.0%) reported at least one episode of watery diarrhea since the beginning of the outbreak. The two more remote districts, Borgne and Pilate were most affected with attack rates up to 16.2%, and case fatality rates up to 15.2% as compared to the two more accessible districts. Care seeking was also less frequent in the more remote areas with as low as 61.6% of reported patients seeking care. Living in remote areas was found as a risk factor for mortality together with older age, greater severity of illness and not seeking care.
These results highlight important geographical disparities and demonstrate that the epidemic caused the highest burden both in terms of cases and deaths in the most remote areas, where up to 5% of the population may have died during the first months of the epidemic. Adapted strategies are needed to rapidly provide treatment as well as prevention measures in remote communities.
","In October 2010, a large cholera outbreak was declared in Haiti and rapidly spread throughout the country, quickly overwhelming the existing health system. Specialized treatment structures were opened rapidly, generally in cities or large villages, and decentralized treatment units or rehydration points were gradually opened later on. To gain insight into the true burden of the cholera outbreak in the community and on potential geographical differences due to accessibility, we conducted a survey in April–May 2011 in a large rural area across four mountainous districts in the Nord department. We interviewed 3,187 households, corresponding to 16,900 individuals, of whom 2,034 (12%) had had diarrhea, probably cholera, since the beginning of the outbreak. The two most remote districts showed higher proportions of population affected by the disease, up to 16.2%, and higher proportions of deaths among patients with probable cholera, up to 15.2%, than the two districts with better accessibility. Remote populations, older patients, severe cases and those not seeking care were at increased risk of dying of the disease. These results show the very high burden of the cholera outbreak in remote areas, emphasizing the need to develop strategies to rapidly provide treatment and prevention measures in remote communities.

"Control of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections relies on the periodic and long-term administration of anthelmintic drugs to high-risk groups, particularly school-age children living in endemic areas. There is limited data on the effectiveness of long-term periodic anthelmintic treatment on the prevalence of STHs, particularly from operational programmes. The current study investigated the impact of 15 to 17 years of treatment with the broad-spectrum anthelmintic ivermectin, used for the control of onchocerciasis, on STH prevalence and intensity in school-age and pre-school children.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in communities that had received annual or twice-annual ivermectin treatments and geographically adjacent communities that had not received treatment in two districts of Esmeraldas Province in Ecuador. Stool samples were collected from school-age children and examined for STH infection using the Kato-Katz and formol-ether concentration methods. Samples were collected also from pre-school children and examined by the formol-ether concentration method. Data on risk factors for STH infection were collected by parental questionnaire. We sampled a total of 3,705 school-age children (6–16 years) from 31 treated and 27 non-treated communities, and 1,701 pre-school children aged 0–5 years from 18 treated and 18 non-treated communities. Among school-age children, ivermectin treatment had significant effects on the prevalence (adjusted OR =  0.06, 95% CI 0.03–0.14) and intensity of Trichuris trichiura infection (adjusted RR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.11–0.70), but appeared to have no impact on Ascaris lumbricoides or hookworm infection. Reduced prevalence and intensities of T. trichiura infection were observed among children not eligible to receive ivermectina, providing some evidence of reduced transmission of T. trichiura infection in communities receiving mass ivermectin treatments.
Annual and twice-annual treatments with ivermectin over a period of up to 17 years may have had a significant impact on T. trichiura infection. The present data indicate that the long-term control of onchocerciasis with ivermectin may provide additional health benefits by reducing infections with trichuriasis. The addition of a second anthelmintic drug such as albendazole may be useful for a long-term effect on A. lumbricoides infection.
","Soil-transmitted helminth (intestinal worm) infections are very common in developing countries and are an important cause of illness. Mass de-worming treatments of school children are an important strategy to reduce illness caused by these infections in communities without access to clean water and sanitation. Few studies have examined the effect of repeated mass treatments in the long-term in controlling these infections. The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of the drug ivermectin used for the control of onchocerciasis (river blindness), that has important effects against intestinal worms, on the epidemiology of intestinal worms in children when administered repeatedly for 15–17 years. We compared the epidemiology of infections between children living in communities that received ivermectin with communities that never received the drug. The data suggest that ivermectin has important differential effects on intestinal worms with a greater impact on infections with Trichuris trichiura and little impact on Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworms infections. Our data suggest that long-term ivermectin treatments may provide health benefits through effects on T. trichiura infections but that the addition of second de-worming drug such as albendazole may be required for the control of other intestinal worm infections.

"The emergence of drug resistant pathogens is a serious public health problem. It is a long-standing goal to predict rates of resistance evolution and design optimal treatment strategies accordingly. To this end, it is crucial to reveal the underlying causes of drug-specific differences in the evolutionary dynamics leading to resistance. However, it remains largely unknown why the rates of resistance evolution via spontaneous mutations and the diversity of mutational paths vary substantially between drugs. Here we comprehensively quantify the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations, a key determinant of evolutionary dynamics, in the presence of eight antibiotics representing the main modes of action. Using precise high-throughput fitness measurements for genome-wide Escherichia coli gene deletion strains, we find that the width of the DFE varies dramatically between antibiotics and, contrary to conventional wisdom, for some drugs the DFE width is lower than in the absence of stress. We show that this previously underappreciated divergence in DFE width among antibiotics is largely caused by their distinct drug-specific dose-response characteristics. Unlike the DFE, the magnitude of the changes in tolerated drug concentration resulting from genome-wide mutations is similar for most drugs but exceptionally small for the antibiotic nitrofurantoin, i.e., mutations generally have considerably smaller resistance effects for nitrofurantoin than for other drugs. A population genetics model predicts that resistance evolution for drugs with this property is severely limited and confined to reproducible mutational paths. We tested this prediction in laboratory evolution experiments using the “morbidostat”, a device for evolving bacteria in well-controlled drug environments. Nitrofurantoin resistance indeed evolved extremely slowly via reproducible mutations—an almost paradoxical behavior since this drug causes DNA damage and increases the mutation rate. Overall, we identified novel quantitative characteristics of the evolutionary landscape that provide the conceptual foundation for predicting the dynamics of drug resistance evolution.
","When bacteria acquire drug resistance through mutation of their genomes, it renders once-powerful treatments useless. For some antibiotics, bacteria develop resistance rapidly, while for other antibiotics this process can be very slow. The causes of such differences in evolutionary dynamics between drugs remain poorly understood. Determining how these mutations that confer drug resistance affect bacterial fitness is a crucial requirement for developing predictions about evolution. In this study, we systematically measured the fitness effects of thousands of mutations that mimic all viable spontaneous gene disruptions in the bacterium Escherichia coli, when exposed to eight different antibiotics that represent the main modes of drug action. We find that the overall magnitude of these fitness effects varies enormously among antibiotics and show that this phenomenon is explained by the drug-specific response of bacteria to small changes in drug dose. We further show that, unlike the fitness effects—which vary greatly—the changes in tolerated drug concentration generated by resistance-conferring mutations are similar for most drugs, with the notable exception of an outlier drug called nitrofurantoin (which has an extremely small tolerated drug concentration range). Using a combination of mathematical modeling and evolution experiments, we propose new quantitative measures that enable partial predictions about how quickly resistance to a given drug will evolve and whether it will reproducibly occur by exploiting the same mutations.

"Lens epithelium–derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) is a cellular cofactor of HIV-1 integrase (IN) that interacts with IN through its IN binding domain (IBD) and tethers the viral pre-integration complex to the host cell chromatin. Here we report the generation of a human somatic LEDGF/p75 knockout cell line that allows the study of spreading HIV-1 infection in the absence of LEDGF/p75. By homologous recombination the exons encoding the LEDGF/p75 IBD (exons 11 to 14) were knocked out. In the absence of LEDGF/p75 replication of laboratory HIV-1 strains was severely delayed while clinical HIV-1 isolates were replication-defective. The residual replication was predominantly mediated by the Hepatoma-derived growth factor related protein 2 (HRP-2), the only cellular protein besides LEDGF/p75 that contains an IBD. Importantly, the recently described IN-LEDGF/p75 inhibitors (LEDGINs) remained active even in the absence of LEDGF/p75 by blocking the interaction with the IBD of HRP-2. These results further support the potential of LEDGINs as allosteric integrase inhibitors.
","Like other viruses, HIV has a limited genome and needs to exploit the machinery of the host cell to complete its replication cycle. The elucidation of virus-host interactions not only sheds light on pathogenesis but also provides opportunities in a limited number of cases to develop novel antiviral drugs. A prototypical example is the interaction between the cellular protein LEDGF/p75 and HIV-1 integrase (IN). Here we generated a human somatic LEDGF/p75 knockout cell line to demonstrate that HIV-1 replication is highly dependent on its cofactor. We show that the residual replication of laboratory strains is predominantly mediated by a LEDGF/p75-related protein, HRP-2. Interestingly, the recently developed HIV-1 IN inhibitors that target the LEDGF/p75-IN interaction interface, LEDGINs, remain active even in the absence of LEDGF/p75. We demonstrate that LEDGINs efficiently block the interaction between IN and HRP-2. In case HIV-1 would be able to bypass LEDGF/p75-dependent replication using HRP-2 as an alternative tether, LEDGINs would remain fully active.

"Specific members of complex microbiota can influence host phenotypes, depending on both the abiotic environment and the presence of other microorganisms. Therefore, it is challenging to define bacterial combinations that have predictable host phenotypic outputs. We demonstrate that plant–bacterium binary-association assays inform the design of small synthetic communities with predictable phenotypes in the host. Specifically, we constructed synthetic communities that modified phosphate accumulation in the shoot and induced phosphate starvation–responsive genes in a predictable fashion. We found that bacterial colonization of the plant is not a predictor of the plant phenotypes we analyzed. Finally, we demonstrated that characterizing a subset of all possible bacterial synthetic communities is sufficient to predict the outcome of untested bacterial consortia. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to infer causal relationships between microbiota membership and host phenotypes and to use these inferences to rationally design novel communities.
","Symbiotic microbes influence host development and health, but predicting which microbes or groups of microbes will have a helpful or harmful effect is a major challenge in microbiome research. In this article, we describe a new method to design and predict bacterial communities that alter the plant host response to phosphate starvation. The method uses plant–bacterium binary-association assays to define groups of bacteria that elicit similar effects on the host plant. By constructing partially overlapping bacterial communities, we demonstrated that it is possible to modify phosphate accumulation in the plant shoot and the induction of plant phosphate starvation genes in a controlled manner. We found that bacterial colonization of the plant root does not predict the capacity to produce this phenotype. We evaluated the predictive performance of different statistical models and identified one best able to predict the behavior of untested communities. Our work demonstrates that studying a subset of all possible bacterial communities is sufficient to anticipate the outcome of novel bacterial combinations, and we establish that it is possible to deduce causality between microbiome composition and host phenotypes in complex systems.

"Mammalian oocytes are arrested at prophase of the first meiotic division in the primordial follicle pool for months, even years, after birth depending on species, and only a limited number of oocytes resume meiosis, complete maturation, and ovulate with each reproductive cycle. We recently reported that protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), a member of the PP2A-like subfamily, which accounts for cellular serine/threonine phosphatase activity, functions in completing the second meiosis. Here, we generated mutant mice with a specific deletion of Ppp6c in oocytes from the primordial follicle stage by crossing Ppp6cF/F mice with Gdf9-Cre mice and found that Ppp6cF/F; GCre+ mice are infertile. Depletion of PP6c caused folliculogenesis defects and germ cell loss independent of the traditional AKT/mTOR pathway, but due to persistent phosphorylation of H2AX (a marker of double strand breaks), increased susceptibility to DNA damage and defective DNA repair, which led to massive oocyte elimination and eventually premature ovarian failure (POF). Our findings uncover an important role for PP6 as an indispensable guardian of genomic integrity of the lengthy prophase I oocyte arrest, maintenance of primordial follicle pool, and thus female fertility.
","Formation of haploid gametes from diploid germ cells requires a specialized reductive cell division known as meiosis. In contrast to male meiosis that takes place continuously, a unique feature of female meiosis in mammals is the long arrest in meiosis I, which lasts up to 50 years in humans. Because the size of the germ cell pool determines the reproductive lifespan of females, it is important to discover mechanisms preserving the germ cell pool during the lengthy meiotic arrest. In this study, we examined the physiological role of a member of the PP2A-like serine/threonine phosphatase subfamily, protein phosphatase 6, in mouse oocytes during ovarian follicular development. This is the first study linking PP6 to the maintenance of the female germ cell pool and fertility. We find PP6 is an indispensable protector of arrested oocytes by safeguarding genomic integrity during their dormancy in the mouse ovary.

"Regulatory proteins can bind to different sets of genomic targets in various cell types or conditions. To reliably characterize such condition-specific regulatory binding we introduce MultiGPS, an integrated machine learning approach for the analysis of multiple related ChIP-seq experiments. MultiGPS is based on a generalized Expectation Maximization framework that shares information across multiple experiments for binding event discovery. We demonstrate that our framework enables the simultaneous modeling of sparse condition-specific binding changes, sequence dependence, and replicate-specific noise sources. MultiGPS encourages consistency in reported binding event locations across multiple-condition ChIP-seq datasets and provides accurate estimation of ChIP enrichment levels at each event. MultiGPS's multi-experiment modeling approach thus provides a reliable platform for detecting differential binding enrichment across experimental conditions. We demonstrate the advantages of MultiGPS with an analysis of Cdx2 binding in three distinct developmental contexts. By accurately characterizing condition-specific Cdx2 binding, MultiGPS enables novel insight into the mechanistic basis of Cdx2 site selectivity. Specifically, the condition-specific Cdx2 sites characterized by MultiGPS are highly associated with pre-existing genomic context, suggesting that such sites are pre-determined by cell-specific regulatory architecture. However, MultiGPS-defined condition-independent sites are not predicted by pre-existing regulatory signals, suggesting that Cdx2 can bind to a subset of locations regardless of genomic environment. A summary of this paper appears in the proceedings of the RECOMB 2014 conference, April 2–5.
","Many proteins that regulate the activity of other genes do so by attaching to the genome at specific binding sites. The locations that a given regulatory protein will bind, and the strength or frequency of such binding at an individual location, can vary depending on the cell type. We can profile the locations that a protein binds in a particular cell type using an experimental method called ChIP-seq, followed by computational interpretation of the data. However, since the experimental data are typically noisy, it is often difficult to compare the computational analyses of ChIP-seq data across multiple experiments in order to understand any differences in binding that may occur in different cell types. In this paper, we present a new computational method named MultiGPS for simultaneously analyzing multiple related ChIP-seq experiments in an integrated manner. By analyzing all the data together in an appropriate way, we can gain a more accurate picture of where the profiled protein is binding to the genome, and we can more easily and reliably detect differences in protein binding across cell types. We demonstrate the MultiGPS software using a new analysis of the regulatory protein Cdx2 in three different developmental cell types.

"Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is a human intestinal pathogen that causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. No vaccines or specific therapies are currently available to prevent or treat these infections. EHEC tightly attaches to the intestinal epithelium by injecting the intimin receptor Tir into the host cell via a type III secretion system (T3SS). In this project, we identified a camelid single domain antibody (nanobody), named TD4, that recognizes a conserved Tir epitope overlapping the binding site of its natural ligand intimin with high affinity and stability. We show that TD4 inhibits attachment of EHEC to cultured human HeLa cells by preventing Tir clustering by intimin, activation of downstream actin polymerization and pedestal formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TD4 significantly reduces EHEC adherence to human colonic mucosa in in vitro organ cultures. Altogether, these results suggest that nanobody-based therapies hold potential in the development of much needed treatment and prevention strategies against EHEC infection.
","Currently, there is no effective treatment or vaccine against enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a bacterial pathogen that infects human colon after the ingestion of contaminated food. It thrives in the colon thanks to its ability to attach intimately to the intestinal epithelium. Here, we have identified and characterised a small antibody fragment (nanobody) that recognises Tir, a receptor injected by the bacterium into the host cell to mediate intimate attachment. This nanobody shows higher affinity against Tir than its natural bacterial ligand (intimin) and, most importantly, blocks the intimate attachment of the pathogen to the human colonic tissue. Our results show the potential of this nanobody to prevent and treat EHEC infection.

"Use of the oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is a vital short-term strategy to control cholera in endemic areas with poor water and sanitation infrastructure. Identifying, estimating, and categorizing the delivery costs of OCV campaigns are useful in analyzing cost-effectiveness, understanding vaccine affordability, and in planning and decision making by program managers and policy makers.
To review and re-estimate oral cholera vaccination program costs and propose a new standardized categorization that can help in collation, analysis, and comparison of delivery costs across countries.
Peer reviewed publications listed in PubMed database, Google Scholar and World Health Organization (WHO) websites and unpublished data from organizations involved in oral cholera vaccination.
The publications and reports containing oral cholera vaccination delivery costs, conducted in low- and middle-income countries based on World Bank Classification. Limits are humans and publication date before December 31st, 2014.
No participants are involved, only costs are collected.
Oral cholera vaccination and cost estimation.
A systematic review was conducted using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cost items were categorized into four main cost groups: vaccination program preparation, vaccine administration, adverse events following immunization and vaccine procurement; the first three groups constituting the vaccine delivery costs. The costs were re-estimated in 2014 US dollars (US$) and in international dollar (I$).
Ten studies were identified and included in the analysis. The vaccine delivery costs ranged from US$0.36 to US$ 6.32 (in US$2014) which was equivalent to I$ 0.99 to I$ 16.81 (in I$2014). The vaccine procurement costs ranged from US$ 0.29 to US$ 29.70 (in US$2014), which was equivalent to I$ 0.72 to I$ 78.96 (in I$2014). The delivery costs in routine immunization systems were lowest from US$ 0.36 (in US$2014) equivalent to I$ 0.99 (in I$2014).
The reported cost categories are not standardized at collection point and may lead to misclassification. Costs for some OCV campaigns are not available and analysis does not include direct and indirect costs to vaccine recipients.
Vaccine delivery cost estimation is needed for budgeting and economic analysis of vaccination programs. The cost categorization methodology presented in this study is helpful in collecting OCV delivery costs in a standardized manner, comparing delivery costs, planning vaccination campaigns and informing decision-making.
","We reviewed and re-estimated oral cholera vaccine delivery costs in low and middle income countries standardizing cost categories. The cost categorization proposed here can help in collation, analysis, comparison and economic analysis of OCV delivery costs across countries.

"A common yet poorly understood evolutionary transition among flowering plants is a switch from outbreeding to an inbreeding mode of mating. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana evolved to an inbreeding state through the loss of self-incompatibility, a pollen-rejection system in which pollen recognition by the stigma is determined by tightly linked and co-evolving alleles of the S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) and its S-locus cysteine-rich ligand (SCR). Transformation of A. thaliana, with a functional AlSRKb-SCRb gene pair from its outcrossing relative A. lyrata, demonstrated that A. thaliana accessions harbor different sets of cryptic self-fertility–promoting mutations, not only in S-locus genes, but also in other loci required for self-incompatibility. However, it is still not known how many times and in what manner the switch to self-fertility occurred in the A. thaliana lineage. Here, we report on our identification of four accessions that are reverted to full self-incompatibility by transformation with AlSRKb-SCRb, bringing to five the number of accessions in which self-fertility is due to, and was likely caused by, S-locus inactivation. Analysis of S-haplotype organization reveals that inter-haplotypic recombination events, rearrangements, and deletions have restructured the S locus and its genes in these accessions. We also perform a Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis to identify modifier loci associated with self-fertility in the Col-0 reference accession, which cannot be reverted to full self-incompatibility. Our results indicate that the transition to inbreeding occurred by at least two, and possibly more, independent S-locus mutations, and identify a novel unstable modifier locus that contributes to self-fertility in Col-0.
","The mating system adopted by a species has a profound influence on extent of polymorphism, population structure, and evolutionary potential. In flowering plants, the switch from outbreeding to inbreeding has occurred repeatedly, yet little is known about the underlying genetic events. This is true even for the model species A. thaliana, a highly self-fertile member of the crucifer family. In this family, outbreeding is enforced by a self-incompatibility system controlled by the S locus, which involves the recognition of pollen by the stigma to prevent self-fertilization and familial inbreeding. We recently demonstrated that A. thaliana accessions may be reverted to full or partial self-incompatibility by transformation with S-locus genes isolated from its close self-incompatible relative A. lyrata. Despite much recent debate, however, we still do not know how A. thaliana became self-fertile. Here, we use our recently established A. thaliana transgenic self-incompatible experimental model to address these issues. Analysis of the S locus in accessions that can be reverted to full self-incompatibility demonstrates that self-fertility in A. thaliana arose by at least two independent S-locus mutations. Furthermore, analysis of an accession that expresses only partial self-incompatibility shows that self-fertility is associated with an unstable allele at a locus unlinked to the S locus.

"Incidence of Entamoeba histolytica infection and clinical manifestations and treatment response of invasive amebiasis (IA) in HIV-infected patients have rarely been investigated before.
At the National Taiwan University Hospital, medical records of HIV-infected patients who received a diagnosis of IA between 1994 and 2005 were reviewed. The incidence of amebiasis was investigated in serial blood and stool samples from 670 and 264 HIV-infected patients, respectively, using serological and specific amebic antigen assays. DNA extracted from stool samples containing E. histolytica were analyzed by PCR, sequenced, and compared. Sixty-four (5.8%) of 1,109 HIV-infected patients had 67 episodes of IA, and 89.1% of them were men having sex with men (MSM). The CD4 count at diagnosis of IA was significantly higher than that of the whole cohort (215 cells/µL vs. 96 cells/µL). Forty episodes (59.7%) were liver abscesses, 52 (77.6%) colitis, and 25 (37.3%) both liver abscesses and colitis. Fever resolved after 3.5 days of metronidazole therapy (range, 1–11 days). None of the patients died. The incidence of E. histolytica infection in MSM was higher than that in other risk groups assessed by serological assays (1.99 per 100 person-years [PY] vs. 0 per 100 PY; p<0.0001) and amebic antigen assays (3.16 per 100 PY vs. 0.68 per 100 PY; p = 0.12). In multiple logistic regression analysis, only MSM was significantly associated with acquisition of E. histolytica infection (adjusted odds ratio, 14.809; p = 0.01). Clustering of E. histolytica isolates by sequencing analyses from geographically-unrelated patients suggested person-to-person transmission.
HIV-infected MSM were at significantly higher risk of amebiasis than patients from other risk groups. Despite immunosuppression, amebic liver abscesses and colitis responded favorably to treatment.
","Entamoeba histolytica, morphologically identical to but genetically different from E. dispar and E. moshkovskii, is the causative agent of amebiasis. Recently there have been reports of increased risk for amebiasis among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to oral-anal sexual contact in several developed countries. In this longitudinal follow-up study, the incidence of amebiasis was determined among HIV-infected patients using serological and specific amebic antigen assays. DNA extracted from stool samples containing E. histolytica were analyzed by PCR, sequenced, and compared. Clinical manifestations and treatment response of invasive amebiasis in HIV-infected patients were reviewed. The results demonstrated that HIV-infected MSM were at significantly higher risk of amebiasis than patients from other risk groups. Clustering of E. histolytica isolates by sequencing analyses from geographically unrelated patients suggested person-to-person transmission. Despite immunosuppression, amebic liver abscesses and colitis responded favorably to metronidazole therapy. It is important to investigate in areas of high incidence of both amebiasis and HIV (sub-Saharan Africa) how generalizable these findings are.

"Mutations can originate from the chance misincorporation of nucleotides during DNA replication or from DNA lesions that arise between replication cycles and are not repaired correctly. We introduce a model that relates the source of mutations to their accumulation with cell divisions, providing a framework for understanding how mutation rates depend on sex, age, and cell division rate. We show that the accrual of mutations should track cell divisions not only when mutations are replicative in origin but also when they are non-replicative and repaired efficiently. One implication is that observations from diverse fields that to date have been interpreted as pointing to a replicative origin of most mutations could instead reflect the accumulation of mutations arising from endogenous reactions or exogenous mutagens. We further find that only mutations that arise from inefficiently repaired lesions will accrue according to absolute time; thus, unless life history traits co-vary, the phylogenetic “molecular clock” should not be expected to run steadily across species.
","We relate how mutations arise to how they accumulate in different sexes, with age and with cell division. This model provides a single framework within which to interpret emerging results from evolutionary biology, human genetics, and cancer genetics. We show that the accrual of mutations should track cell divisions not only when mutations originate during DNA replication but also when they arise through non-replicative mechanisms and are repaired efficiently. This realization means that previous observations of correlations between mutation and cell division rates actually provide little support to the commonly held belief that most germline and somatic mutations arise from replication errors. We further find that only mutations that arise from inefficiently repaired lesions will accrue according to absolute time; thus, without covariation in life history traits, the phylogenetic “molecular clock” should not be expected to run at constant rates across species.

"JC virus is a member of the Polyomavirus family of DNA tumor viruses and the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a disease that occurs primarily in people who are immunocompromised and is usually fatal. As with other Polyomavirus family members, the replication of JC virus (JCV) DNA is dependent upon the virally encoded protein T-antigen. To further our understanding of JCV replication, we have determined the crystal structure of the origin-binding domain (OBD) of JCV T-antigen. This structure provides the first molecular understanding of JCV T-ag replication functions; for example, it suggests how the JCV T-ag OBD site-specifically binds to the major groove of GAGGC sequences in the origin. Furthermore, these studies suggest how the JCV OBDs interact during subsequent oligomerization events. We also report that the OBD contains a novel “pocket”; which sequesters the A1 & B2 loops of neighboring molecules. Mutagenesis of a residue in the pocket associated with the JCV T-ag OBD interfered with viral replication. Finally, we report that relative to the SV40 OBD, the surface of the JCV OBD contains one hemisphere that is highly conserved and one that is highly variable.
","Polyomaviruses have been invaluable tools for biomedical research into basic cellular processes. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that members of this family are also involved in human diseases, particularly among the immunocompromised and the elderly. The subject of this study, the JC virus (JCV), is a member of this family and the causative agent of a brain disease termed Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), a disease that is often fatal and for which there is no cure. Herein we present the high-resolution crystal structure of the origin binding domain (OBD) from the JCV initiator protein large T-antigen. Furthermore, we propose a molecular model for the oligomerization of the JCV T-antigen OBD that is based upon the crystal structure. We also report a novel pocket that modeling studies suggest is available when the OBD is site-specifically bound to DNA and therefore may represent a possible starting point for structure-based drug design.

"Significant departures from expected Mendelian inheritance ratios (transmission ratio distortion, TRD) are frequently observed in both experimental crosses and natural populations. TRD on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 2 has been reported in multiple experimental crosses, including the Collaborative Cross (CC). Among the eight CC founder inbred strains, we found that Chr 2 TRD was exclusive to females that were heterozygous for the WSB/EiJ allele within a 9.3 Mb region (Chr 2 76.9 – 86.2 Mb). A copy number gain of a 127 kb-long DNA segment (designated as responder to drive, R2d) emerged as the strongest candidate for the causative allele. We mapped R2d sequences to two loci within the candidate interval. R2d1 is located near the proximal boundary, and contains a single copy of R2d in all strains tested. R2d2 maps to a 900 kb interval, and the number of R2d copies varies from zero in classical strains (including the mouse reference genome) to more than 30 in wild-derived strains. Using real-time PCR assays for the copy number, we identified a mutation (R2d2WSBdel1) that eliminates the majority of the R2d2WSB copies without apparent alterations of the surrounding WSB/EiJ haplotype. In a three-generation pedigree segregating for R2d2WSBdel1, the mutation is transmitted to the progeny and Mendelian segregation is restored in females heterozygous for R2d2WSBdel1, thus providing direct evidence that the copy number gain is causal for maternal TRD. We found that transmission ratios in R2d2WSB heterozygous females vary between Mendelian segregation and complete distortion depending on the genetic background, and that TRD is under genetic control of unlinked distorter loci. Although the R2d2WSB transmission ratio was inversely correlated with average litter size, several independent lines of evidence support the contention that female meiotic drive is the cause of the distortion. We discuss the implications and potential applications of this novel meiotic drive system.
","One of the strongest expectations in genetics is that chromosomes segregate randomly during meiosis. However, genetic loci that exhibit transmission ratio distortion (TRD) are sometimes observed in offspring of F1 hybrids. Meiotic drive is a type of non-Mendelian inheritance in which a “selfish” genetic element exploits asymmetric female meiotic cell division to promote its preferential inclusion in ova. We previously reported TRD on Chr 2 in the CC, a mouse recombinant inbred panel with contributions from three Mus musculus subspecies. Here we show that maternal TRD consistent with a novel meiotic drive system is caused by a copy number gain. This mutation is similar in size and structure to other known meiotic drive responders, such as the knobs of maize. A deletion of most of the copies is sufficient to restore Mendelian segregation, proving that the copy number variant is causative of the observed TRD. In the CC, and also the related DO population, the transmission frequency of the favored allele varies dependent on genetic background, demonstrating that this system is under genetic control. In conclusion, we describe a novel wild-derived meiotic drive locus on mouse Chr 2 that exploits female meiosis asymmetry to violate the Laws of Mendelian inheritance.

"Atypical/Nor98 scrapie was first identified in 1998 in Norway. It is now considered as a worldwide disease of small ruminants and currently represents a significant part of the detected transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) cases in Europe. Atypical/Nor98 scrapie cases were reported in ARR/ARR sheep, which are highly resistant to BSE and other small ruminants TSE agents. The biology and pathogenesis of the Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent in its natural host is still poorly understood. However, based on the absence of detectable abnormal PrP in peripheral tissues of affected individuals, human and animal exposure risk to this specific TSE agent has been considered low. In this study we demonstrate that infectivity can accumulate, even if no abnormal PrP is detectable, in lymphoid tissues, nerves, and muscles from natural and/or experimental Atypical/Nor98 scrapie cases. Evidence is provided that, in comparison to other TSE agents, samples containing Atypical/Nor98 scrapie infectivity could remain PrPSc negative. This feature will impact detection of Atypical/Nor98 scrapie cases in the field, and highlights the need to review current evaluations of the disease prevalence and potential transmissibility. Finally, an estimate is made of the infectivity loads accumulating in peripheral tissues in both Atypical/Nor98 and classical scrapie cases that currently enter the food chain. The results obtained indicate that dietary exposure risk to small ruminants TSE agents may be higher than commonly believed.
","Following the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis and the identification of its zoonotic properties, a sanitary policy has been implemented based on both eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) in food-producing animals and exclusion of known infectious materials from the food chain. Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is a prion disease of small ruminants identified worldwide. Currently it represents a significant part of the TSE cases detected in Europe. The restricted tissue distribution of Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent in its natural host and the low detected prevalence of secondary cases in affected flocks meant that it is believed to be a poorly transmissible disease. This has led to the view that Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is a spontaneous disorder for which human and animal exposure risk remains low. In this study we demonstrate that in affected individuals, Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent can disseminate in lymphoid tissues, nerves, and muscles, challenging the idea that it is a brain-restricted infectious agent. Evidence for the deficiencies in the current methods applied for monitoring Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is provided that would indicate an underestimation in the prevalence in the general population and in the affected flocks. These elements challenge the hypothesis on the biology of this recently identified TSE agent.

"Variations in gene expression level might lead to phenotypic diversity across individuals or populations. Although many human genes are found to have differential mRNA levels between populations, the extent of gene expression that could vary within and between populations largely remains elusive. To investigate the dynamic range of gene expression, we analyzed the expression variability of ∼18, 000 human genes across individuals within HapMap populations. Although ∼20% of human genes show differentiated mRNA levels between populations, our results show that expression variability of most human genes in one population is not significantly deviant from another population, except for a small fraction that do show substantially higher expression variability in a particular population. By associating expression variability with sequence polymorphism, intriguingly, we found SNPs in the untranslated regions (5′ and 3′UTRs) of these variable genes show consistently elevated population heterozygosity. We performed differential expression analysis on a genome-wide scale, and found substantially reduced expression variability for a large number of genes, prohibiting them from being differentially expressed between populations. Functional analysis revealed that genes with the greatest within-population expression variability are significantly enriched for chemokine signaling in HIV-1 infection, and for HIV-interacting proteins that control viral entry, replication, and propagation. This observation combined with the finding that known human HIV host factors show substantially elevated expression variability, collectively suggest that gene expression variability might explain differential HIV susceptibility across individuals.
","Many human genes have population-specific expression levels, which are linked to population-specific polymorphisms and copy-number variations. However, it is unclear whether human genes show similar dynamic range of expression between populations. In this work we analyzed HapMap gene expression compendium, and quantified the between-population and within-population expression variability for ∼18,000 human transcripts. We first concluded that the majority of the human genes have similar levels of within-population variability. However, a small fraction (∼4%) does show much higher expression variability in one population, and the deviation is consistently associated with increased SNP heterozygosity in their UTR regulatory regions. We further showed that genes with the greatest within-population expression variability are significantly enriched for chemokine signaling associated with HIV-1 infection. Combined with the finding that human HIV-1 host factors tend to have increased expression variability within populations, our analysis may explain, at least in part, different susceptibility to HIV infection within the human population. This work provides a fresh angle for analyzing gene expression variations in populations.

"Scientific research funding is allocated largely through a system of soliciting and ranking competitive grant proposals. In these competitions, the proposals themselves are not the deliverables that the funder seeks, but instead are used by the funder to screen for the most promising research ideas. Consequently, some of the funding program's impact on science is squandered because applying researchers must spend time writing proposals instead of doing science. To what extent does the community's aggregate investment in proposal preparation negate the scientific impact of the funding program? Are there alternative mechanisms for awarding funds that advance science more efficiently? We use the economic theory of contests to analyze how efficiently grant proposal competitions advance science, and compare them with recently proposed, partially randomized alternatives such as lotteries. We find that the effort researchers waste in writing proposals may be comparable to the total scientific value of the research that the funding supports, especially when only a few proposals can be funded. Moreover, when professional pressures motivate investigators to seek funding for reasons that extend beyond the value of the proposed science (e.g., promotion, prestige), the entire program can actually hamper scientific progress when the number of awards is small. We suggest that lost efficiency may be restored either by partial lotteries for funding or by funding researchers based on past scientific success instead of proposals for future work.
","The grant proposal system compels researchers to devote substantial time to writing proposals that could have instead been used to do science. Here, we use the economic theory of contests to show that as fewer grants are funded, the value of the science that researchers forgo while preparing proposals can approach or exceed the value of the science that the funding program supports. As a result, much of the scientific impact of the funding program is squandered. Unfortunately, increased waste and reduced efficiency is inevitable in a grant proposal competition when the number of awards is small. How can scarce funds be allocated efficiently, then? As one alternative, we show that a partial lottery that selects proposals for funding randomly from among those that pass a qualifying standard can restore lost efficiency by reducing investigators' incentives to invest heavily in preparing proposals. Lotteries could also improve efficiency by compelling administrators to de-emphasize grant success as a primary measure of professional achievement. If lotteries are politically untenable, another remedy would be to fund researchers based on their previous research successes, although in such a way that avoids establishing barriers to entry for junior scientists or scientists from historically underrepresented demographic groups.

"Intestinal microfold (M) cells possess a high transcytosis capacity and are able to transport a broad range of materials including particulate antigens, soluble macromolecules, and pathogens from the intestinal lumen to inductive sites of the mucosal immune system. M cells are also the primary pathway for delivery of secretory IgA (SIgA) to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. However, although the consequences of SIgA uptake by M cells are now well known and described, the mechanisms whereby SIgA is selectively bound and taken up remain poorly understood. Here we first demonstrate that both the Cα1 region and glycosylation, more particularly sialic acid residues, are involved in M cell–mediated reverse transcytosis. Second, we found that SIgA is taken up by M cells via the Dectin-1 receptor, with the possible involvement of Siglec-5 acting as a co-receptor. Third, we establish that transcytosed SIgA is taken up by mucosal CX3CR1+ dendritic cells (DCs) via the DC-SIGN receptor. Fourth, we show that mucosal and systemic antibody responses against the HIV p24-SIgA complexes administered orally is strictly dependent on the expression of Dectin-1. Having deciphered the mechanisms leading to specific targeting of SIgA-based Ag complexes paves the way to the use of such a vehicle for mucosal vaccination against various infectious diseases.
","Secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies are secreted into the gut lumen and are considered to be a first line of defense in protecting the intestinal epithelium from gut pathogens. SIgA patrol the mucus and are usually known to help immune tolerance via entrapping dietary antigens and microorganisms and other mechanisms. SIgA, in complex with its antigens, can also be taken back up by the intestinal epithelium in a process known as reverse transcytosis. SIgA can thereby promote the uptake and delivery of antigens from the intestinal lumen to the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissues (GALT), influencing inflammatory responses. This reverse transcytosis of SIgA is mediated by specialized epithelial M cells. Because M cells possess the ability to take up antigens and are therefore important to the local immune system, they are a key target for the specific delivery of novel mucosal vaccines against various diseases. M cell receptors that take up the SIgA-antigen complexes, which serve as mucosal vaccine vehicles, represent an important aspect of this vaccine strategy. The identification of SIgA receptor(s) on the surface of M cells has, however, remained elusive for more than a decade. In this study, we now identify Dectin-1 and Siglec-5 as the key receptors for M cell–mediated reverse transcytosis of SIgA complexes. We further find that the glycosylation modification, and particularly sialylation, of SIgA is required for its uptake by M cells. We show that, when administered orally in complex with SIgA, the HIV p24 antigen is taken up in a strictly Dectin-1-dependent manner to stimulate a mucosal and systemic antibody response. These findings are considered important for understanding gut immunity.

"The deregulation of metabolism is a hallmark of aging. As such, changes in the expression of metabolic genes and the profiles of amino acid levels are features associated with aging animals. We previously reported that the levels of most amino acids decline with age in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Glycine, in contrast, substantially accumulates in aging C. elegans. In this study we show that this is coupled to a decrease in gene expression of enzymes important for glycine catabolism. We further show that supplementation of glycine significantly prolongs C. elegans lifespan, and early adulthood is important for its salutary effects. Moreover, supplementation of glycine ameliorates specific transcriptional changes that are associated with aging. Glycine feeds into the methionine cycle. We find that mutations in components of this cycle, methionine synthase (metr-1) and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (sams-1), completely abrogate glycine-induced lifespan extension. Strikingly, the beneficial effects of glycine supplementation are conserved when we supplement with serine, which also feeds into the methionine cycle. RNA-sequencing reveals a similar transcriptional landscape in serine- and glycine-supplemented worms both demarked by widespread gene repression. Taken together, these data uncover a novel role of glycine in the deceleration of aging through its function in the methionine cycle.
","There is a growing number of studies showing that amino acids function as signal metabolites that influence aging and health. Although contemporary -OMICs studies have uncovered various associations between metabolite levels and aging, in many cases the directionality of the relationships is unclear. In a recent metabolomics study, we found that glycine accumulates in aged C. elegans while other amino acids decrease. The present study shows that glycine supplementation increases lifespan and drives a genome-wide inhibition effect on C. elegans gene expression. Glycine as a one-carbon donor fuels the methyl pool of one-carbon metabolism composed of the folate and methionine cycles. We find that the glycine-mediated longevity effect is fully dependent on the methionine cycle, and that all of our observations are conserved with supplementation of the other one-carbon amino acid, serine. These results provide a novel role for glycine as a promoter of longevity and bring new insight into the role of one-carbon amino acids in the regulation of aging that may ultimately be beneficial for humans.

"Brucella abortus and B. melitensis have been reported in several studies in animals in Zimbabwe but the extent of the disease remains poorly known. Thus, characterizing the circulating strains is a critical first step in understanding brucellosis in the country. In this study we used an array of molecular assays including AMOS-PCR, Bruce-ladder, multiple locus variable number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) and single nucleotide polymorphisms from whole genome sequencing (WGS-SNP) to characterize Brucella isolates to the species, biovar, and individual strain level. Sixteen Brucella strains isolated in Zimbabwe at the Central Veterinary laboratory from various hosts were characterized using all or some of these assays. The strains were identified as B. ovis, B. abortus, B. canis and B. suis, with B. canis being the first report of this species in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean strains identified as B. suis and B. abortus were further characterized with whole genome sequencing and were closely related to reference strains 1330 and 86/8/59, respectively. We demonstrate the range of different tests that can be performed from simple assays that can be run in laboratories lacking sophisticated instrumentation to whole genome analyses that currently require substantial expertise and infrastructure often not available in the developing world.
","Brucellosis is endemic in Zimbabwe. This article describes the use of various assays such as AMOS, Bruce-ladder, MLVA, and whole genome sequencing to characterize Brucella species isolated from different animals in Zimbabwe. Choice of which assays to use in the laboratory is generally done considering reproducibility, robustness, expertise and affordability in a given setting. As evidenced in this study, most laboratories in Africa lack resources especially finances, equipments and expertise to perform necessary tests for diagnosis and identification of specific pathogens. The study shows that the differentiation of species can be correctly concluded from the analysis with AMOS, Bruce-ladder and MLVA16 assays. Furthermore, MLVA16 can be used as an epidemiological tool and traceback of outbreaks. These PCR assays can therefore add to the control and eradication of brucellosis, since the Brucella species (B. ovis, B. abortus, B. suis and B. canis) existing in Zimbabwe could be identified and characterized.

"Most mammalian genes are able to express several splice variants in a phenomenon known as alternative splicing. Serious alterations of alternative splicing occur in cancer tissues, leading to expression of multiple aberrant splice forms. Most studies of alternative splicing defects have focused on the identification of cancer-specific splice variants as potential therapeutic targets. Here, we examine instead the bulk of non-specific transcript isoforms and analyze their level of disorder using a measure of uncertainty called Shannon's entropy. We compare isoform expression entropy in normal and cancer tissues from the same anatomical site for different classes of transcript variations: alternative splicing, polyadenylation, and transcription initiation. Whereas alternative initiation and polyadenylation show no significant gain or loss of entropy between normal and cancer tissues, alternative splicing shows highly significant entropy gains for 13 of the 27 cancers studied. This entropy gain is characterized by a flattening in the expression profile of normal isoforms and is correlated to the level of estimated cellular proliferation in the cancer tissue. Interestingly, the genes that present the highest entropy gain are enriched in splicing factors. We provide here the first quantitative estimate of splicing disruption in cancer. The expression of normal splice variants is widely and significantly disrupted in at least half of the cancers studied. We postulate that such splicing disorders may develop in part from splicing alteration in key splice factors, which in turn significantly impact multiple target genes.
","RNA splicing is the process by which gene products are pieced together to form a mature messenger RNA (mRNA). In normal cells, RNA splicing is a tightly controlled process that leads to production of a well-defined set of mRNAs. Cancer cells, however, often produce aberrant, mis-spliced mRNAs. Such disorders have not been quantified to date. To this end, we use a well-known measure of disorder called Shannon's entropy. We show that overall splicing disorders are highly significant in many cancers, and that the extent of disorder may be correlated to the level of cell proliferation in each tumor. Surprisingly, genes that control the splicing mechanism are unusually frequent among genes affected by splicing disorders. This suggests that cancer cells may withstand harmful chain reactions in which splicing defects in key regulatory genes would in turn cause extensive splicing damage. As mis-spliced mRNAs are widely studied for cancer diagnosis, awareness of these global disorders is important to distinguish reliable cancer markers from background noise.

"Interleukin 18 (IL18) is a cytokine that plays an important role in inflammation as well as host defense against microbes. Mammals encode a soluble inhibitor of IL18 termed IL18 binding protein (IL18BP) that modulates IL18 activity through a negative feedback mechanism. Many poxviruses encode homologous IL18BPs, which contribute to virulence. Previous structural and functional studies on IL18 and IL18BPs revealed an essential binding hot spot involving a lysine on IL18 and two aromatic residues on IL18BPs. The aromatic residues are conserved among the very diverse mammalian and poxviruses IL18BPs with the notable exception of yatapoxvirus IL18BPs, which lack a critical phenylalanine residue. To understand the mechanism by which yatapoxvirus IL18BPs neutralize IL18, we solved the crystal structure of the Yaba-Like Disease Virus (YLDV) IL18BP and IL18 complex at 1.75 Å resolution. YLDV-IL18BP forms a disulfide bonded homo-dimer engaging IL18 in a 2∶2 stoichiometry, in contrast to the 1∶1 complex of ectromelia virus (ECTV) IL18BP and IL18. Disruption of the dimer interface resulted in a functional monomer, however with a 3-fold decrease in binding affinity. The overall architecture of the YLDV-IL18BP:IL18 complex is similar to that observed in the ECTV-IL18BP:IL18 complex, despite lacking the critical lysine-phenylalanine interaction. Through structural and mutagenesis studies, contact residues that are unique to the YLDV-IL18BP:IL18 binding interface were identified, including Q67, P116 of YLDV-IL18BP and Y1, S105 and D110 of IL18. Overall, our studies show that YLDV-IL18BP is unique among the diverse family of mammalian and poxvirus IL-18BPs in that it uses a bivalent binding mode and a unique set of interacting residues for binding IL18. However, despite this extensive divergence, YLDV-IL18BP binds to the same surface of IL18 used by other IL18BPs, suggesting that all IL18BPs use a conserved inhibitory mechanism by blocking a putative receptor-binding site on IL18.
","Interleukin 18 (IL18) is an important cytokine in inflammation and immunity. Mammals and poxviruses encode homologous inhibitory proteins of IL18, named IL18BPs, which regulate IL18 activity and, in the case of the viral proteins, contribute to virulence. Previous structural and functional studies revealed residues at IL18:IL18BP interface that are critical for the high-affinity binding, including a phenylalanine on IL18BPs, which is conserved among nearly all IL18BPs with the notable exception of yatapoxvirus IL18BPs. To understand the mechanism by which yatapoxvirus IL18BPs neutralize IL18, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of the Yaba-Like Disease Virus (YLDV) IL18BP:IL18 complex. The structure revealed a 2∶2 bivalent binding complex, which has not been observed in any other IL18BPs. Through mutagenesis and functional studies, we found a set of interacting residues that are unique for the association of YLDV-IL18BP and IL18, likely compensating for the lack of the interactions involving the conserved phenylalanine. Despite this extensive divergence, however, YLDV-IL18BP binds to the same surface of IL18 used by other IL18BPs. Our study suggests that all IL18BPs use a conserved inhibitory mechanism by blocking a putative receptor-binding site on IL18 but the interface on IL18 is malleable by a broad and diverse family of mammalian and poxvirus IL18BPs.

"An important determinant of a pathogen's success is the rate at which it is transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts. Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.
","Different strains of hospital pathogens may differ in their ability to spread between patients and respond differently to control measures. Attempts to quantify such between-strain variation are lacking in high prevalence settings. We analysed data from concurrent outbreaks with different MRSA strains in two adult intensive care units. MRSA is usually carried by patients asymptomatically, and most of our data came from routine screening swabs used to detect such carriage. We divided strains into two groups: common United Kingdom strains and strains from a type often found in Southeast Asia. We developed a new method to estimate how transmission changes over time and compared results with those from an adaptation of a previously described approach. An advantage of the new method is that it makes weaker assumptions about the process generating the data. The methods gave broadly similar results: the introduction of daily antiseptic bodywashes for all patients was the only intervention associated with a substantial fall in transmission, but this intervention was less effective for the Asian strain. This work should be useful for assessing the between-strain variation in the transmission of other hospital pathogens, and for assessing the impact of interventions on patient-to-patient transmission.

"HIV-infected individuals have deficient responses to Yellow Fever vaccine (YFV) and may be at higher risk for adverse events (AE). Chronic immune activation–characterized by low CD4/CD8 ratio or high indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO) activity—may influence vaccine response in this population.
We prospectively assessed AE, viremia by the YFV virus and YF-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in HIV-infected (CD4>350) and -uninfected adults through 1 year after vaccination. The effect of HIV status on initial antibody response to YFV was measured during the first 3 months following vaccination, while the effect on persistence of antibody response was measured one year following vaccination. We explored CD4/CD8 ratio, IDO activity (plasma kynurenine/tryptophan [KT] ratio) and viremia by Human Pegivirus as potential predictors of NAb response to YFV among HIV-infected participants with linear mixed models.
12 HIV-infected and 45-uninfected participants were included in the final analysis. HIV was not significantly associated with AE, YFV viremia or NAb titers through the first 3 months following vaccination. However, HIV–infected participants had 0.32 times the NAb titers observed for HIV-uninfected participants at 1 year following YFV (95% CI 0.13 to 0.83, p = 0.021), independent of sex, age and prior vaccination. In HIV-infected participants, each 10% increase in CD4/CD8 ratio predicted a mean 21% higher post-baseline YFV Nab titer (p = 0.024). Similarly, each 10% increase in KT ratio predicted a mean 21% lower post-baseline YFV Nab titer (p = 0.009). Viremia by Human Pegivirus was not significantly associated with NAb titers.
HIV infection appears to decrease the durability of NAb responses to YFV, an effect that may be predicted by lower CD4/CD8 ratio or higher KT ratio.
","Yellow Fever (YF) vaccine is considered one of the most effective vaccines ever produced. However, previous studies suggest that HIV impairs YF vaccine response. In this study, we assessed if HIV infection impacts the risk of adverse events and could reduce antibody response to YF vaccine. We explored if laboratory markers of persistent inflammation, frequently present among HIV-infected patients, could predict antibody response to YF vaccine in this population. We found that HIV had no significant effect on adverse events or levels of antibodies through 3 months after vaccination, but this may be limited by the small sample size of 12 HIV-infected and 45-uninfected participants in the study. However, we were able to show that, compared to HIV-uninfected participants, HIV–infected patients had lower antibody titers 1 year following YF vaccine even after statistical adjustment for the potential effects of sex, age and prior vaccination. Persistent inflammation seems to reduce YF vaccine antibody response in HIV-infected participants. In conclusion, HIV-infected individuals have impaired antibody response to YFV due to a poorer persistence of antibodies, despite a seemingly normal initial response. HIV-infected patients at permanent or recurring risk of YF infection may benefit from a booster dose of YF vaccine.

"Viral capsid proteins assemble into large, symmetrical architectures that are not found in complexes formed by their cellular counterparts. Given the prevalence of the signature jelly-roll topology in viral capsid proteins, we are interested in whether these functionally unique capsid proteins are also structurally unique in terms of folds. To explore this question, we applied a structure-alignment based clustering of all protein chains in VIPERdb filtered at 40% sequence identity to identify distinct capsid folds, and compared the cluster medoids with a non-redundant subset of protein domains in the SCOP database, not including the viral capsid entries. This comparison, using Template Modeling (TM)-score, identified 2078 structural “relatives” of capsid proteins from the non-capsid set, covering altogether 210 folds following the definition in SCOP. The statistical significance of the 210 folds shared by two sets of the same sizes, estimated from 10,000 permutation tests, is less than 0.0001, which is an upper bound on the p-value. We thus conclude that viral capsid proteins are segregated in structural fold space. Our result provides novel insight on how structural folds of capsid proteins, as opposed to their surface chemistry, might be constrained during evolution by requirement of the assembled cage-like architecture. Also importantly, our work highlights a guiding principle for virus-based nanoplatform design in a wide range of biomedical applications and materials science.
","Viruses are increasingly viewed not as pathogens that parasitize all domains of life, but as useful nanoplatforms for synthetic maneuvers in a wide range of biomedical and materials science applications. One of the most well-known examples of virus-based nanotools developed so far features viral capsules as therapeutic agents, which protect and deliver drug molecules to targeted disease sites in the human body before the drug molecules are released. In order to optimize these nano-designs to best fulfill their purposes, we first have to understand properties of the constitutive building blocks of these viral containers, so as to rationalize and guide the synthetic modification attempts. Based on the observation that viral shells are functionally unique to viruses, we hypothesize that the structure of the building blocks must also be distinct from generic proteins, given that function follows form. Our computational modeling and statistical analysis support this novel hypothesis, and recognize the folded topology of these ‘Lego’ proteins as a differentiating factor to ensure correct geometry, and consequently, proper tiling into the large complex architecture. Our findings highlight an important design principle: efforts on imparting new functionalities to virus templates should restrain from disrupting the fundamental protein fold.

"Prions are infectious agents causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases of humans and animals. In humans, these have sporadic, acquired and inherited aetiologies. The inherited prion diseases are caused by one of over 30 coding mutations in the human prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP) and many of these generate infectious prions as evidenced by their experimental transmissibility by inoculation to laboratory animals. However, some, and in particular an extensively studied type of Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) caused by a PRNP A117V mutation, are thought not to generate infectious prions and instead constitute prion proteinopathies with a quite distinct pathogenetic mechanism. Multiple attempts to transmit A117V GSS have been unsuccessful and typical protease-resistant PrP (PrPSc), pathognomonic of prion disease, is not detected in brain. Pathogenesis is instead attributed to production of an aberrant topological form of PrP, C-terminal transmembrane PrP (CtmPrP). Barriers to transmission of prion strains from one species to another appear to relate to structural compatibility of PrP in host and inoculum and we have therefore produced transgenic mice expressing human 117V PrP. We found that brain tissue from GSS A117V patients did transmit disease to these mice and both the neuropathological features of prion disease and presence of PrPSc was demonstrated in the brains of recipient transgenic mice. This PrPSc rapidly degraded during laboratory analysis, suggesting that the difficulty in its detection in patients with GSS A117V could relate to post-mortem proteolysis. We conclude that GSS A117V is indeed a prion disease although the relative contributions of CtmPrP and prion propagation in neurodegeneration and their pathogenetic interaction remains to be established.
","Prions are infectious agents causing incurable brain disease in humans and animals. Prion diseases are by definition transmissible, which means that it should be possible to experimentally transfer disease from patient brain tissue to laboratory animals by inoculation. While many forms of prion disease have been shown to be experimentally transmissible, some inherited forms, in particular, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) associated with the substitution of valine for alanine at amino acid position 117 (GSS A117V) of the human prion protein gene have not. This has led to the suggestion that such syndromes are not true prion diseases and are better designated non-transmissible proteinopathies. Since prions may transmit more efficiently when the host's normal prion protein amino acid sequence matches that of the infecting prion, we generated transgenic mice expressing human prion protein with the same amino acid sequence found in A117V GSS. We found that brain tissue from GSS A117V patients could transmit disease to these mice, producing the typical brain lesions associated with GSS A117V. We therefore conclude that GSS A117V is an authentic prion disease.

"New antiretroviral drugs that offer large genetic barriers to resistance, such as the recently approved inhibitors of HIV-1 protease, tipranavir and darunavir, present promising weapons to avert the failure of current therapies for HIV infection. Optimal treatment strategies with the new drugs, however, are yet to be established. A key limitation is the poor understanding of the process by which HIV surmounts large genetic barriers to resistance. Extant models of HIV dynamics are predicated on the predominance of deterministic forces underlying the emergence of resistant genomes. In contrast, stochastic forces may dominate, especially when the genetic barrier is large, and delay the emergence of resistant genomes. We develop a mathematical model of HIV dynamics under the influence of an antiretroviral drug to predict the waiting time for the emergence of genomes that carry the requisite mutations to overcome the genetic barrier of the drug. We apply our model to describe the development of resistance to tipranavir in in vitro serial passage experiments. Model predictions of the times of emergence of different mutant genomes with increasing resistance to tipranavir are in quantitative agreement with experiments, indicating that our model captures the dynamics of the development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs accurately. Further, model predictions provide insights into the influence of underlying evolutionary processes such as recombination on the development of resistance, and suggest guidelines for drug design: drugs that offer large genetic barriers to resistance with resistance sites tightly localized on the viral genome and exhibiting positive epistatic interactions maximally inhibit the emergence of resistant genomes.
","The ability of HIV to rapidly acquire mutations responsible for resistance to administered drugs underlies the failure of current antiretroviral therapies for HIV infection. The recent advent of drugs that offer large genetic barriers to resistance, e.g., tipranavir and darunavir, presents a new opportunity to devise therapies that remain efficacious over extended durations. The large number of mutations that HIV must accumulate for resistance to drugs with large genetic barriers impedes the failure of therapy. Further, these drugs appear to exhibit activity against viral strains resistant to other drugs in the same drug class, thereby significantly improving options for therapy. Rational identification of treatment protocols that maximize the impact of these new drugs requires a quantitative understanding of the process whereby HIV overcomes large genetic barriers to resistance. We develop a model that describes HIV dynamics under the influence of a drug that offers a large genetic barrier to resistance and predict the time of emergence of viral strains that overcome the large barrier. Model predictions provide insights into the roles of various evolutionary forces underlying the development of resistance, quantitatively describe the development of resistance to tipranavir in vitro, and suggest guidelines for drug design.

"Left-ventricular outflow tract obstructions (LVOTO) encompass a wide spectrum of phenotypically heterogeneous heart malformations which frequently cluster in families. We performed family based whole-exome and targeted re-sequencing on 182 individuals from 51 families with multiple affected members. Central to our approach is the family unit which serves as a reference to identify causal genotype-phenotype correlations. Screening a multitude of 10 overlapping phenotypes revealed disease associated and co-segregating variants in 12 families. These rare or novel protein altering mutations cluster predominantly in genes (NOTCH1, ARHGAP31, MAML1, SMARCA4, JARID2, JAG1) along the Notch signaling cascade. This is in line with a significant enrichment (Wilcoxon, p< 0.05) of variants with a higher pathogenicity in the Notch signaling pathway in patients compared to controls. The significant enrichment of novel protein truncating and missense mutations in NOTCH1 highlights the allelic and phenotypic heterogeneity in our pediatric cohort. We identified novel co-segregating pathogenic mutations in NOTCH1 associated with left and right-sided cardiac malformations in three independent families with a total of 15 affected individuals. In summary, our results suggest that a small but highly pathogenic fraction of family specific mutations along the Notch cascade are a common cause of LVOTO.
","Left-ventricular outflow tract obstructions comprise a group of developmental heart disorders that are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, with no single gene accounting for the majority of cases. In order to identify mutations contributing to disease, we selected patients from 51 families with a history of congenital cardiac malformations. We interrogated the entire coding sequences of 106 patients and identified a small but highly pathogenic fraction of mutations that are likely to contribute to disease in 12 families (23.5%). Furthermore, we present a strategy for identifying candidate mutations based on familial segregation in a genetically heterogeneous disorder.

"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) has emerged as an important mediator of interbacterial interactions. A T6SS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa targets at least three effector proteins, type VI secretion exported 1–3 (Tse1–3), to recipient Gram-negative cells. The Tse2 protein is a cytoplasmic effector that acts as a potent inhibitor of target cell proliferation, thus providing a pronounced fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa donor cells. P. aeruginosa utilizes a dedicated immunity protein, type VI secretion immunity 2 (Tsi2), to protect against endogenous and intercellularly-transferred Tse2. Here we show that Tse2 delivered by the T6SS efficiently induces quiescence, not death, within recipient cells. We demonstrate that despite direct interaction of Tsi2 and Tse2 in the cytoplasm, Tsi2 is dispensable for targeting the toxin to the secretory apparatus. To gain insights into the molecular basis of Tse2 immunity, we solved the 1.00 Å X-ray crystal structure of Tsi2. The structure shows that Tsi2 assembles as a dimer that does not resemble previously characterized immunity or antitoxin proteins. A genetic screen for Tsi2 mutants deficient in Tse2 interaction revealed an acidic patch distal to the Tsi2 homodimer interface that mediates toxin interaction and immunity. Consistent with this finding, we observed that destabilization of the Tsi2 dimer does not impact Tse2 interaction. The molecular insights into Tsi2 structure and function garnered from this study shed light on the mechanisms of T6 effector secretion, and indicate that the Tse2–Tsi2 effector–immunity pair has features distinguishing it from previously characterized toxin–immunity and toxin–antitoxin systems.
","Bacterial species have been at war with each other for over a billion years. During this period they have evolved many pathways for besting the competition; one of the most recent of these to be described is the type VI secretion system (T6SS). The T6SS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a complex machine that the bacterium uses to intoxicate neighboring cells. Among the toxins this system delivers is type VI secretion exported 2 (Tse2). In addition to acting on competing organisms, this toxin can act on P. aeruginosa; thus, the organism synthesizes a protein, type VI secretion immunity 2 (Tsi2), which neutralizes the toxin. In this paper we dissect the function and structure of Tsi2. We show that although Tsi2 interacts with and stabilizes Tse2 inside the bacterium, the toxin does not require the immunity protein to reach the secretion apparatus. Our structure of Tsi2 shows that the protein adopts a dimeric configuration; however, we find that its dimerization is not required for Tse2 interaction. Instead, our findings indicate that Tse2 interacts with an acidic surface of Tsi2 that is opposite the homodimer interface. Our results provide key molecular insights into the process of T6 toxin secretion and immunity.

"The ability of pathogenic microorganisms to assimilate essential nutrients from their hosts is critical for pathogenesis. Here we report endothelial zinc sequestration by the major human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. We hypothesised that, analogous to siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, C. albicans utilises an extracellular zinc scavenger for acquiring this essential metal. We postulated that such a “zincophore” system would consist of a secreted factor with zinc-binding properties, which can specifically reassociate with the fungal cell surface. In silico analysis of the C. albicans secretome for proteins with zinc binding motifs identified the pH-regulated antigen 1 (Pra1). Three-dimensional modelling of Pra1 indicated the presence of at least two zinc coordination sites. Indeed, recombinantly expressed Pra1 exhibited zinc binding properties in vitro. Deletion of PRA1 in C. albicans prevented fungal sequestration and utilisation of host zinc, and specifically blocked host cell damage in the absence of exogenous zinc. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PRA1 arose in an ancient fungal lineage and developed synteny with ZRT1 (encoding a zinc transporter) before divergence of the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Structural modelling indicated physical interaction between Pra1 and Zrt1 and we confirmed this experimentally by demonstrating that Zrt1 was essential for binding of soluble Pra1 to the cell surface of C. albicans. Therefore, we have identified a novel metal acquisition system consisting of a secreted zinc scavenger (“zincophore”), which reassociates with the fungal cell. Furthermore, functional similarities with phylogenetically unrelated prokaryotic systems indicate that syntenic zinc acquisition loci have been independently selected during evolution.
","The capacity of disease-causing microbes to acquire nutrients from their host is one of the most fundamental aspects of infection. Host organisms therefore restrict microbial access to certain key nutrients in a process known as nutritional immunity. Recently, it was found that infected vertebrates sequester zinc from invading microorganisms to control infection. Therefore, the mechanisms of microbial zinc acquisition represent potential virulence attributes. Here we report the molecular mechanism of host-derived zinc acquisition by the major human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. We show that C. albicans utilises a secreted protein, the pH-regulated antigen 1 (Pra1), to bind zinc from its environment. Pra1 then reassociates with the fungal cell via a syntenically encoded (genetically-linked) membrane transporter (Zrt1) to acquire this essential metal. Deletion of PRA1 prevented utilisation of host zinc and damage of host cells in the absence of exogenous zinc. Finally, we demonstrate that this zinc-scavenging locus arose in an ancient fungal lineage and remains conserved in many contemporary species. Syntenically arranged zinc acquisition systems have evolved independently in the fungal and bacterial kingdoms, suggesting that such an arrangement is evolutionary beneficial for microorganisms.

"Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that must coordinate the acquisition of host cell-derived biosynthetic constituents essential for bacterial survival. Purified chlamydiae contain several lipids that are typically found in eukaryotes, implying the translocation of host cell lipids to the chlamydial vacuole. Acquisition and incorporation of sphingomyelin occurs subsequent to transport from Golgi-derived exocytic vesicles, with possible intermediate transport through endosomal multivesicular bodies. Eukaryotic host cell-derived sphingomyelin is essential for intracellular growth of Chlamydia trachomatis, but the precise role of this lipid in development has not been delineated. The present study identifies specific phenotypic effects on inclusion membrane biogenesis and stability consequent to conditions of sphingomyelin deficiency. Culturing infected cells in the presence of inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase, the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of host cell sphingomyelin, resulted in loss of inclusion membrane integrity with subsequent disruption in normal chlamydial inclusion development. Surprisingly, this was accompanied by premature redifferentiation to and release of infectious elementary bodies. Homotypic fusion of inclusions was also disrupted under conditions of sphingolipid deficiency. In addition, host cell sphingomyelin synthesis was essential for inclusion membrane stability and expansion that is vital to reactivation of persistent chlamydial infection. The present study implicates both the Golgi apparatus and multivesicular bodies as key sources of host-derived lipids, with multivesicular bodies being essential for normal inclusion development and reactivation of persistent C. trachomatis infection.
","The genus Chlamydia is composed of a group of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause several human diseases of medical significance. C. trachomatis is the most commonly encountered sexually transmitted pathogen, as well as the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. The prevalence of chlamydial infections, and the extraordinary morbidity and health care costs associated with chronic persisting disease, justifies the research efforts in this area of microbial pathogenesis. Despite their clinical importance, the mechanisms by which these intracellular bacteria obtain nutrients essential to their growth remain enigmatic. Acquisition of sphingolipids, from the cells that chlamydiae infect, is essential for bacterial propagation. This study identifies a requirement for the lipid sphingomyelin from the infected host cell for bacterial replication during infection, and for long-term subsistence in persistent chlamydial infection. Blockage of sphingomyelin acquisition results in premature release of bacteria, a reduced bacterial number, and failure of the bacteria to cause a persisting infection. In this study, we have identified and subsequently disrupted specific sphingomyelin transport pathways, providing important implications on therapeutic intervention targeting this successful microbial pathogen.

"Norovirus infection is the leading cause of food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide, being responsible for over 200,000 deaths annually. Studies with murine norovirus (MNV) showed that protective STAT1 signaling controls viral replication and pathogenesis, but the immune mechanisms that noroviruses exploit to induce pathology are elusive. Here, we show that gastrointestinal MNV infection leads to widespread IL-1β maturation in MNV-susceptible STAT1-deficient mice. MNV activates the canonical Nlrp3 inflammasome in macrophages, leading to maturation of IL-1β and to Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis. STAT1-deficient macrophages displayed increased MAVS-mediated expression of pro-IL-1β, facilitating elevated Nlrp3-dependent release of mature IL-1β upon MNV infection. Accordingly, MNV-infected Stat1-/- mice showed Nlrp3-dependent maturation of IL-1β as well as Nlrp3-dependent pyroptosis as assessed by in vivo cleavage of GSDMD to its active N-terminal fragment. While MNV-induced diarrheic responses were not affected, Stat1-/- mice additionally lacking either Nlrp3 or GSDMD displayed lower levels of the fecal inflammatory marker Lipocalin-2 as well as delayed lethality after gastrointestinal MNV infection. Together, these results uncover new insights into the mechanisms of norovirus-induced inflammation and cell death, thereby revealing Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and ensuing GSDMD-driven pyroptosis as contributors to MNV-induced immunopathology in susceptible STAT1-deficient mice.
","Gastrointestinal norovirus infections form a serious socio-economic worldwide problem, with about 684 million cases annually worldwide and mortality occurring both in underdeveloped countries and in immunocompromised patients. Despite the urgent global need, no specific treatments are available for norovirus induced gastroenteritis, partly because innate immune responses upon gastrointestinal norovirus infection are largely unresolved. Using the murine norovirus (MNV) model we showed that MNV infection in macrophages leads to a lytic form of cell death termed pyroptosis as well as to the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Maturation of IL-1β was observed also in vivo, after gastrointestinal infection of MNV-susceptible Stat1 knockout mice. We found that these innate immune responses upon MNV infection crucially depended on activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome leading to Gasdermin D-driven pyroptosis, and inactivating this signaling pathway delayed lethality of MNV-susceptible STAT1 knockout mice after gastrointestinal MNV infection. We thus identified Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and ensuing pyroptosis as a signaling pathway contributing to norovirus-induced immunopathology. Taken together, this study resulted in a more detailed understanding of MNV-induced inflammatory and cell death pathways and provided insights into how gastrointestinal viruses induce immunopathology.

"Pungent chemical compounds originating from decaying tissue are strong drivers of animal behavior. Two of the best-characterized death smell components are putrescine (PUT) and cadaverine (CAD), foul-smelling molecules produced by decarboxylation of amino acids during decomposition. These volatile polyamines act as ‘necromones’, triggering avoidance or attractive responses, which are fundamental for the survival of a wide range of species. The few studies that have attempted to identify the cognate receptors for these molecules have suggested the involvement of the seven-helix trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), localized in the olfactory epithelium. However, very little is known about the precise chemosensory receptors that sense these compounds in the majority of organisms and the molecular basis of their interactions. In this work, we have used computational strategies to characterize the binding between PUT and CAD with the TAAR6 and TAAR8 human receptors. Sequence analysis, homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics studies suggest a tandem of negatively charged aspartates in the binding pocket of these receptors which are likely to be involved in the recognition of these small biogenic diamines.
","The distinctive dead smell comes largely from molecules like cadaverine and putrescine that are produced during decomposition of organic tissues. These volatile compounds act as powerful chemical signals important for the survival of a wide range of species. Previous studies have identified the trace amine-associated receptor 13c (or TAAR13c) in zebrafish as the cognate receptor of cadaverine in bony fishes. In this work, we employed computational strategies to disclose the human TAAR6 and TAAR8 receptors as sensors of the putrescine and cadaverine molecules. Our results indicate that several negatively charged residues in the ligand binding pocket of these receptors constitute the molecular basis for recognition of these necromones in humans.

"Decoding models, such as those underlying multivariate classification algorithms, have been increasingly used to infer cognitive or clinical brain states from measures of brain activity obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The practicality of current classifiers, however, is restricted by two major challenges. First, due to the high data dimensionality and low sample size, algorithms struggle to separate informative from uninformative features, resulting in poor generalization performance. Second, popular discriminative methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) rarely afford mechanistic interpretability. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a novel generative-embedding approach that incorporates neurobiologically interpretable generative models into discriminative classifiers. Our approach extends previous work on trial-by-trial classification for electrophysiological recordings to subject-by-subject classification for fMRI and offers two key advantages over conventional methods: it may provide more accurate predictions by exploiting discriminative information encoded in ‘hidden’ physiological quantities such as synaptic connection strengths; and it affords mechanistic interpretability of clinical classifications. Here, we introduce generative embedding for fMRI using a combination of dynamic causal models (DCMs) and SVMs. We propose a general procedure of DCM-based generative embedding for subject-wise classification, provide a concrete implementation, and suggest good-practice guidelines for unbiased application of generative embedding in the context of fMRI. We illustrate the utility of our approach by a clinical example in which we classify moderately aphasic patients and healthy controls using a DCM of thalamo-temporal regions during speech processing. Generative embedding achieves a near-perfect balanced classification accuracy of 98% and significantly outperforms conventional activation-based and correlation-based methods. This example demonstrates how disease states can be detected with very high accuracy and, at the same time, be interpreted mechanistically in terms of abnormalities in connectivity. We envisage that future applications of generative embedding may provide crucial advances in dissecting spectrum disorders into physiologically more well-defined subgroups.
","Neurological and psychiatric spectrum disorders are typically defined in terms of particular symptom sets, despite increasing evidence that the same symptom may be caused by very different pathologies. Pathophysiological classification and effective treatment of such disorders will increasingly require a mechanistic understanding of inter-individual differences and clinical tools for making accurate diagnostic inference in individual patients. Previous classification studies have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to differentiate between healthy controls and neurological or psychiatric patients. However, these studies are typically based on descriptive patterns and indirect measures of neural activity, and they rarely afford mechanistic insights into the underlying condition. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a classification approach that rests on a model of brain function and exploits the rich discriminative information encoded in directed interregional connection strengths. Based on an fMRI dataset acquired from moderately aphasic patients and healthy controls, we illustrate that our approach enables more accurate classification and deeper mechanistic insights about disease processes than conventional classification methods.

"Paired Immunoglobulin-like Type 2 Receptor Alpha (PILRA) is a cell surface inhibitory receptor that recognizes specific O-glycosylated proteins and is expressed on various innate immune cell types including microglia. We show here that a common missense variant (G78R, rs1859788) of PILRA is the likely causal allele for the confirmed Alzheimer’s disease risk locus at 7q21 (rs1476679). The G78R variant alters the interaction of residues essential for sialic acid engagement, resulting in >50% reduced binding for several PILRA ligands including a novel ligand, complement component 4A, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein B. PILRA is an entry receptor for HSV-1 via glycoprotein B, and macrophages derived from R78 homozygous donors showed significantly decreased levels of HSV-1 infection at several multiplicities of infection compared to homozygous G78 macrophages. We propose that PILRA G78R protects individuals from Alzheimer’s disease risk via reduced inhibitory signaling in microglia and reduced microglial infection during HSV-1 recurrence.
","Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic risk factors. Despite considerable progress in defining the genetic component of AD risk, understanding the biology of common variant associations is a challenge. We find that PILRA G78R (rs1859788) is the likely AD risk variant from the 7q21 locus (rs1476679) and PILRA G78R reduces PILRA endogenous and exogenous ligand binding. Our study highlights a new immune signaling axis in AD and suggests a role for exogenous ligands (HSV-1). Further, we have identified that reduced function of a negative regulator of microglia and neutrophils is protective from AD risk, providing a new candidate therapeutic target.

"Antibiotic treatment of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis is important in acute rheumatic fever (ARF) prevention, however clinical guidelines for prescription vary. GAS carriers with acute viral infections may receive antibiotics unnecessarily. This review assessed the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis and carriage in different settings.
A random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Prevalence estimates for GAS+ve pharyngitis, serologically-confirmed GAS pharyngitis and asymptomatic pharyngeal carriage were generated. Findings were stratified by age group, recruitment method and country income level. Medline and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant literature published between 1 January 1946 and 7 April 2017. Studies reporting prevalence data on GAS+ve or serologically-confirmed GAS pharyngitis that stated participants exhibited symptoms of pharyngitis or upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) were included. Included studies reporting the prevalence of asymptomatic GAS carriage needed to state participants were asymptomatic.
285 eligible studies were identified. The prevalence of GAS+ve pharyngitis was 24.1% (95% CI: 22.6–25.6%) in clinical settings (which used ‘passive recruitment’ methods), but less in sore throat management programmes (which used ‘active recruitment’, 10.0%, 8.1–12.4%). GAS+ve pharyngitis was more prevalent in high-income countries (24.3%, 22.6–26.1%) compared with low/middle-income countries (17.6%, 14.9–20.7%). In clinical settings, approximately 10% of children swabbed with a sore throat have serologically-confirmed GAS pharyngitis, but this increases to around 50–60% when the child is GAS culture-positive. The prevalence of serologically-confirmed GAS pharyngitis was 10.3% (6.6–15.7%) in children from high-income countries and their asymptomatic GAS carriage prevalence was 10.5% (8.4–12.9%). A lower carriage prevalence was detected in children from low/middle income countries (5.9%, 4.3–8.1%).
In active sore throat management programmes, if the prevalence of GAS detection approaches the asymptomatic carriage rate (around 6–11%), there may be little benefit from antibiotic treatment as the majority of culture-positive patients are likely carriers.
","Treating sore throats caused by Group A Streptococcus infections (GAS pharyngitis) with antibiotics is important for preventing acute rheumatic fever (ARF). It is impossible to distinguish patients with true GAS pharyngitis infections from GAS carriers with pharyngitis caused by viral infections when throat swab culturing alone is used to diagnose GAS pharyngitis. Carriers are not likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment, but may receive treatment unnecessarily. Reported rates of GAS pharyngitis and carriage vary considerably depending on the setting. Thus it is difficult to ascertain which groups are likely to benefit significantly from active sore throat management programmes which treat GAS pharyngitis in order to prevent ARF. We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis and asymptomatic carriage in different settings. Approximately 10% of all children swabbed for a sore throat in clinical settings have true GAS pharyngitis, but this increases to around 55% if the children have GAS detected in their throat using swab cultures. In active sore throat management programmes, the prevalence of GAS detection is lower than in clinical settings and if it declines towards 8% (the asymptomatic carriage level), there may be little benefit in treating GAS culture-positive patients with antibiotics.

"Herpesviruses infect the majority of the human population and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 causes cold sores and herpes simplex keratitis, whereas HSV-2 is responsible for genital herpes. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common viral cause of congenital defects and is responsible for serious disease in immuno-compromised individuals. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with infectious mononucleosis and a broad range of malignancies, including Burkitt’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease, and post-transplant lymphomas. Herpesviruses persist in their host for life by establishing a latent infection that is interrupted by periodic reactivation events during which replication occurs. Current antiviral drug treatments target the clinical manifestations of this productive stage, but they are ineffective at eliminating these viruses from the infected host. Here, we set out to combat both productive and latent herpesvirus infections by exploiting the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target viral genetic elements important for virus fitness. We show effective abrogation of HCMV and HSV-1 replication by targeting gRNAs to essential viral genes. Simultaneous targeting of HSV-1 with multiple gRNAs completely abolished the production of infectious particles from human cells. Using the same approach, EBV can be almost completely cleared from latently infected EBV-transformed human tumor cells. Our studies indicate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be effectively targeted to herpesvirus genomes as a potent prophylactic and therapeutic anti-viral strategy that may be used to impair viral replication and clear latent virus infection.
","Herpesviruses are large DNA viruses that are carried by almost 100% of the adult human population. Herpesviruses include several important human pathogens, such as herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type 1 and 2 (causing cold sores and genital herpes, respectively), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV; the most common viral cause of congenital defects, and responsible for serious disease in immuno-compromised individuals), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; associated with infectious mononucleosis and a wide range of malignancies). Current antiviral drug treatments are not effective in clearing herpesviruses from infected individuals. Therefore, there is a need for alternative strategies to combat these pathogenic viruses and prevent or cure herpesvirus-associated diseases. Here, we have assessed whether a direct attack of herpesvirus genomes within virus-infected cells can inactivate these viruses. For this, we have made use of the recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 genome-engineering system to target and alter specific regions within the genome of these viruses. By targeting sites in the genomes of three different herpesviruses (HSV-1, HCMV, and EBV), we show complete inhibition of viral replication and in some cases even eradication of the viral genomes from infected cells. The findings presented in this study open new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat pathogenic human herpesviruses using novel genome-engineering technologies.

"Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia of the central nervous system and ensure rapid saltatory conduction. Shortage or loss of these cells leads to severe malfunctions as observed in human leukodystrophies and multiple sclerosis, and their replenishment by reprogramming or cell conversion strategies is an important research aim. Using a transgenic approach we increased levels of the transcription factor Sox10 throughout the mouse embryo and thereby prompted Fabp7-positive glial cells in dorsal root ganglia of the peripheral nervous system to convert into cells with oligodendrocyte characteristics including myelin gene expression. These rarely studied and poorly characterized satellite glia did not go through a classic oligodendrocyte precursor cell stage. Instead, Sox10 directly induced key elements of the regulatory network of differentiating oligodendrocytes, including Olig2, Olig1, Nkx2.2 and Myrf. An upstream enhancer mediated the direct induction of the Olig2 gene. Unlike Sox10, Olig2 was not capable of generating oligodendrocyte-like cells in dorsal root ganglia. Our findings provide proof-of-concept that Sox10 can convert conducive cells into oligodendrocyte-like cells in vivo and delineates options for future therapeutic strategies.
","Developmental or acquired defects of oligodendrocytes or their myelin sheaths impairs saltatory nerve conduction in the central nervous system and thus leads to severe neurological diseases. Strategies to regenerate or replace these cells require a deeper understanding of the regulatory processes that underlie their generation during development. Here we show in a Sox10 overexpressing mouse model that increase of the levels of a single transcription factor during embryogenesis efficiently converts the already Sox10 expressing satellite glial cells of the peripheral nervous system into oligodendrocyte-like cells by a mechanism that does not simply recapitulate developmental oligodendrogenesis but involves direct Sox10-dependent induction of the oligodendroglial differentiation network. Our study identifies mechanisms that may help to convert other cell types into oligodendrocytes and thus prove eventually useful for therapies of myelin diseases.

"The Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) proteins are key regulators of neuronal development that function in axon extension and guidance, termination of axon outgrowth, and synapse formation. Outside of development, the PHR proteins also regulate axon regeneration and Wallerian degeneration. The PHR proteins function in part by acting as ubiquitin ligases that degrade the Dual Leucine zipper-bearing Kinase (DLK). Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans PHR protein, Regulator of Presynaptic Morphology 1 (RPM-1), also utilizes a phosphatase-based mechanism to regulate DLK-1. Using mass spectrometry, we identified Protein Phosphatase Magnesium/Manganese dependent 2 (PPM-2) as a novel RPM-1 binding protein. Genetic, transgenic, and biochemical studies indicated that PPM-2 functions coordinately with the ubiquitin ligase activity of RPM-1 and the F-box protein FSN-1 to negatively regulate DLK-1. PPM-2 acts on S874 of DLK-1, a residue implicated in regulation of DLK-1 binding to a short, inhibitory isoform of DLK-1 (DLK-1S). Our study demonstrates that PHR proteins function through both phosphatase and ubiquitin ligase mechanisms to inhibit DLK. Thus, PHR proteins are potentially more accurate and sensitive regulators of DLK than originally thought. Our results also highlight an important and expanding role for the PP2C phosphatase family in neuronal development.
","The molecular mechanisms that govern formation of functional synaptic connections are central to brain development and function. We have used the nematode C. elegans to explore the mechanism of how the intracellular signaling protein RPM-1 regulates neuronal development. Using a combination of proteomic, genetic, transgenic, and biochemical approaches we have shown that RPM-1 functions through a PP2C phosphatase, PPM-2, to regulate the activity of a MAP3 kinase, DLK-1. Our results indicate that a combination of PPM-2 phosphatase activity and RPM-1 ubiquitin ligase activity inhibit DLK-1.

"According to World Health Organization (WHO) prevalence estimates, 1.1 million people in Mexico are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD). However, limited information is available about access to antitrypanosomal treatment. This study assesses the extent of access in Mexico, analyzes the barriers to access, and suggests strategies to overcome them.
Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 18 key informants and policymakers at the national level in Mexico. Data on CD cases, relevant policy documents and interview data were analyzed using the Flagship Framework for Pharmaceutical Policy Reform policy interventions: regulation, financing, payment, organization, and persuasion. Data showed that 3,013 cases were registered nationally from 2007–2011, representing 0.41% of total expected cases based on Mexico's national prevalence estimate. In four of five years, new registered cases were below national targets by 11–36%. Of 1,329 cases registered nationally in 2010–2011, 834 received treatment, 120 were pending treatment as of January 2012, and the treatment status of 375 was unknown. The analysis revealed that the national program mainly coordinated donation of nifurtimox and that important obstacles to access include the exclusion of antitrypanosomal medicines from the national formulary (regulation), historical exclusion of CD from the social insurance package (organization), absence of national clinical guidelines (organization), and limited provider awareness (persuasion).
Efforts to treat CD in Mexico indicate an increased commitment to addressing this disease. Access to treatment could be advanced by improving the importation process for antitrypanosomal medicines and adding them to the national formulary, increasing education for healthcare providers, and strengthening clinical guidelines. These recommendations have important implications for other countries in the region with similar problems in access to treatment for CD.
","Chagas disease is a vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is most frequently transmitted by triatomine insects but can also be passed through blood donation or from mother to child at birth. Experts estimate that 8 million people are infected with Chagas disease globally and that 1.1 million of these infections are found in Mexico. Most public health programs for Chagas disease focus on preventing new infections through vector control and screening the blood supply. However, in recent years there has been a greater focus on treating the disease with one of two available medications, benznidazole or nifurtimox. This study explores access to these two drugs in Mexico. The study shows that less than 0.5% of those who are infected with the disease received treatment in Mexico in years. The study also identified important factors that limit access in Mexico, including the exclusion of both drugs from the national health insurance program and problems importing these medications. Finally, the paper suggests ways that these problems can be overcome in Mexico, while providing helpful insight for other countries that struggle with similar problems in treating this disease.

"Our work addresses two key challenges, one biological and one methodological. First, we aim to understand how proliferation and cell migration rates in the intestinal epithelium are related under healthy, damaged (Ara-C treated) and recovering conditions, and how these relations can be used to identify mechanisms of repair and regeneration. We analyse new data, presented in more detail in a companion paper, in which BrdU/IdU cell-labelling experiments were performed under these respective conditions. Second, in considering how to more rigorously process these data and interpret them using mathematical models, we use a probabilistic, hierarchical approach. This provides a best-practice approach for systematically modelling and understanding the uncertainties that can otherwise undermine the generation of reliable conclusions—uncertainties in experimental measurement and treatment, difficult-to-compare mathematical models of underlying mechanisms, and unknown or unobserved parameters. Both spatially discrete and continuous mechanistic models are considered and related via hierarchical conditional probability assumptions. We perform model checks on both in-sample and out-of-sample datasets and use them to show how to test possible model improvements and assess the robustness of our conclusions. We conclude, for the present set of experiments, that a primarily proliferation-driven model suffices to predict labelled cell dynamics over most time-scales.
","The intestinal epithelium is an important model system for studying the dynamics and regulation of multicellular populations. It is characterised by rapid rates of self-renewal and repair; dysregulation of these processes is thought to explain, in part, why many tumours form in the intestinal and similar epithelial tissues. These features have led to a large amount of work on estimating cell kinetic parameters in the intestine. There remain, however, large gaps between the raw data collected, the interpretation of these experimental data, and mechanistic models that describe the underlying processes. Hierarchical statistical modelling provides a natural method with which to bridge these gaps, but has, to date, been underutilised in the study of intestinal tissue self-renewal. As we illustrate, this approach makes essential use of the distinction between ‘measurement’, ‘process’ and ‘parameter’ models, giving an explicit framework for combining experimental data and mechanistic modelling in the presence of multiple sources of uncertainty. We apply this approach to analyse experiments on healthy, damaged and recovering intestinal tissue, finding that observed data can be explained by a model in which cell movement is driven primarily by proliferation.

"Fish-borne zoonotic trematodes (FZT) infections including liver- and minute intestinal flukes are common in Southeast Asia in both humans and domestic animals eating raw fish and since 2010, the liver flukes are recognised as neglected tropical diseases by WHO. Mass drug treatment with praziquantel is advised for humans, but no recommendations for control of the FZT in the reservoir hosts exist.
A study was conducted to assess the ability of praziquantel treatment for control of FZT in farm dogs in an endemic area in Northern Vietnam. Initially, 101 dogs from 73 households were examined for small trematode eggs in their faeces. Forty seven copro-positive dogs were included in the study. Thirty eight dogs received treatment with a single dose of 40 mg/kg of praziquantel. A group of nine dogs were left untreated. Coprological examination for small trematode eggs was performed on day 0, 3, 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 post treatment. Farmers were questioned about dog keeping practises. All dogs were copro-negative for small trematode eggs on both day 3 and 10 post treatment. From day 30 onwards previously negative dogs became positive again. The reinfection rates were 26.3% (day 30), 45.5% (day 60), 53.1% (day 90), 61.3% (day 120).The nine untreated dogs remained positive throughout the study period. There was no difference in the intensity of infection at day 0 and 120 neither in the treated or untreated group.
Dogs had easy access to raw fish and did not receive treatment against flukes by their owner. More than 50% of the dogs were reinfected 3 months post treatment. We do not recommend controlling FZT infections in dogs by anthelmintic treatment alone since reinfection occurs fast under the existing farm management systems.
","Fish-borne zoonotic trematodes (FZT) including liver and small intestinal flukes in humans and domestic animals are a growing problem in Southeast Asia. WHO has recently recognized the problem, listed the liver flukes as neglected tropical diseases and recommends mass drug treatment of humans to overcome the diseases. Domestic animals including dogs, cats and pigs contribute to transmission and the infection must be controlled in these animals if the transmission cycle shall be broken. We studied the effect of a single praziquantel treatment in a group of natural infected dogs in an FZT endemic area in Northern Vietnam. The dogs were followed over 4 months after treatment and management practices were described. We found that dogs had easy access to raw fish and did not receive treatment against flukes by their owners. More than fifty per cent of the dogs became reinfected with FZT within 3 months after treatment. We conclude that repeated mass treatments are not applicable and cannot stand alone for control of FZT in dogs. The reinfection pattern in humans treated for FZT needs to be investigated to monitor effect of mass drug treatments and avoid development of drug resistance.

"Purpureocillium lilacinum of Ophiocordycipitaceae is one of the most promising and commercialized agents for controlling plant parasitic nematodes, as well as other insects and plant pathogens. However, how the fungus functions at the molecular level remains unknown. Here, we sequenced two isolates (PLBJ-1 and PLFJ-1) of P. lilacinum from different places Beijing and Fujian. Genomic analysis showed high synteny of the two isolates, and the phylogenetic analysis indicated they were most related to the insect pathogen Tolypocladium inflatum. A comparison with other species revealed that this fungus was enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), proteases and pathogenesis related genes. Whole genome search revealed a rich repertoire of secondary metabolites (SMs) encoding genes. The non-ribosomal peptide synthetase LcsA, which is comprised of ten C-A-PCP modules, was identified as the core biosynthetic gene of lipopeptide leucinostatins, which was specific to P. lilacinum and T. ophioglossoides, as confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, gene expression level was analyzed when PLBJ-1 was grown in leucinostatin-inducing and non-inducing medium, and 20 genes involved in the biosynthesis of leucionostatins were identified. Disruption mutants allowed us to propose a putative biosynthetic pathway of leucinostatin A. Moreover, overexpression of the transcription factor lcsF increased the production (1.5-fold) of leucinostatins A and B compared to wild type. Bioassays explored a new bioactivity of leucinostatins and P. lilacinum: inhibiting the growth of Phytophthora infestans and P. capsici. These results contribute to our understanding of the biosynthetic mechanism of leucinostatins and may allow us to utilize P. lilacinum better as bio-control agent.
","Purpureocillium lilacinum, a well-known bio-control agent against various plant pathogens in agriculture, can produce antibiotic leucinostatins—peptaibiotic with extensive biological activities, including antimalarial, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor activities, as well as phytotoxic. We have sequenced the genomes of two P. lilacinum isolates, and compared them with other fungi, focusing on their bio-control characteristics. We discovered a rich repertoire of CAZymes, proteases, SMs and pathogenesis related genes. We also identified a gene cluster containing 20 genes involved in the leucinostatins A and B biosynthesis by gene deletion, qRT-PCR and RNA-seq analyses. A transcription factor in the pathway was overexpressed, resulting in the upregulation of the related genes and a 1.5-fold increase in leucinostatins A and B. A new bioactivity of leucinostatins, inhibition of the growth of the notorious Phytophthora, was identified in this study by confronting incubation with P. lilacinum. These results provided new strategies for the agricultural development of leucinostatins and improving P. lilacinum strains.

"While most of the world is thought to be on long-term economic growth paths, more than one-sixth of the world is roughly as poor today as their ancestors were hundreds of years ago. The majority of the extremely poor live in the tropics. The latitudinal gradient in income is highly suggestive of underlying biophysical drivers, of which disease conditions are an especially salient example. However, conclusions have been confounded by the simultaneous causality between income and disease, in addition to potentially spurious relationships. We use a simultaneous equations model to estimate the relative effects of vector-borne and parasitic diseases (VBPDs) and income on each other, controlling for other factors. Our statistical model indicates that VBPDs have systematically affected economic development, evident in contemporary levels of per capita income. The burden of VBDPs is, in turn, determined by underlying ecological conditions. In particular, the model predicts it to rise as biodiversity falls. Through these positive effects on human health, the model thus identifies measurable economic benefits of biodiversity.
","While most of the world is thought to be growing economically, more than one-sixth of the world is roughly as poor today as their ancestors were hundreds of years ago. The extremely poor live largely in the tropics. This latitudinal gradient in income suggests that there are biophysical factors, such as the burden of disease, driving the effect. However, measuring the effects of disease on broad economic indicators is confounded by the fact that economic indicators simultaneously influence health. We get around this by using simultaneous equation modeling to estimate the relative effects of disease and income on each other while controlling for other factors. Our model indicates that vector-borne and parasitic diseases (VBPDs) have systematically affected economic development. Importantly, we show that the burden of VBPDs is, in turn, determined by underlying ecological conditions. In particular, the model predicts that the burden of disease will rise as biodiversity falls. The health benefits of biodiversity, therefore, potentially constitute an ecosystem service that can be quantified in terms of income generated.

"The pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us9 protein plays a central role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons. As a result, Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo. However, it is unclear how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of so many viral proteins. It is known that the glycoproteins gB, gC, gD and gE are associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes, and are directed into the axon in a Us9-dependent manner. In this report, we determined that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts, and that this association is critical to Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. We used infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires many of the characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). In these cells, Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Moreover, reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. We conclude that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and, as a consequence, for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system.
","Alpha herpesviruses are common mammalian pathogens (e.g. herpes simplex and chickenpox virus infect humans). These viruses enter and spread in and out of the mammalian nervous system, a defining hallmark of their lifecycle and potential pathogenesis. Neurons are polarized cells, and the movement of certain cellular proteins is highly restricted to the cell body, to dendrites, or to axons. Indeed, the axon harbors only a small subset of neuronal proteins. Thus, it is remarkable that these viruses efficiently gather and move their structural components from the cell body to the axon after infection of neurons. Previously, we identified a small viral membrane protein (known as Us9) that mediates the efficient targeting of virus particles to axons of infected neurons. We now report that Us9 must localize to “lipid raft” domains, specialized regions within cellular membranes to promote axonal targeting. Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts dramatically reduces sorting of structural proteins to axons. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to implicate lipid rafts in targeting alpha herpesvirus structural proteins to axons, an essential step for spread of infection in the mammalian nervous system.

"Response to antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD) cannot be predicted currently, leading to uncertainty in medication selection, increasing costs, and prolonged suffering for many patients. Despite tremendous efforts in identifying response-associated genes in large genome-wide association studies, the results have been fairly modest, underlining the need to establish conceptually novel strategies. For the identification of transcriptome signatures that can distinguish between treatment responders and nonresponders, we herein submit a novel animal experimental approach focusing on extreme phenotypes. We utilized the large variance in response to antidepressant treatment occurring in DBA/2J mice, enabling sample stratification into subpopulations of good and poor treatment responders to delineate response-associated signature transcript profiles in peripheral blood samples. As a proof of concept, we translated our murine data to the transcriptome data of a clinically relevant human cohort. A cluster of 259 differentially regulated genes was identified when peripheral transcriptome profiles of good and poor treatment responders were compared in the murine model. Differences in expression profiles from baseline to week 12 of the human orthologues selected on the basis of the murine transcript signature allowed prediction of response status with an accuracy of 76% in the patient population. Finally, we show that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-regulated genes are significantly enriched in this cluster of antidepressant-response genes. Our findings point to the involvement of GR sensitivity as a potential key mechanism shaping response to antidepressant treatment and support the hypothesis that antidepressants could stimulate resilience-promoting molecular mechanisms. Our data highlight the suitability of an appropriate animal experimental approach for the discovery of treatment response-associated pathways across species.
","Major depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. However, only one-third of patients with depression benefit from the first antidepressant compound they are prescribed. It is a fundamental problem that the outcomes of individual antidepressant treatments are still highly unpredictable. In clinical studies, discovery of biomarkers for antidepressant response is hampered by confounding factors such as the heterogeneity of the disease phenotype and additional environmental factors, e.g., previous life events and different schedules of psychopharmacological treatment, which reduce the power to detect true response biomarkers. To overcome some of these limitations, we have established a conceptually novel approach that allows the selection of extreme phenotypes in an antidepressant-responsive mouse strain. In the first step, we identify signatures in the transcriptome of peripheral blood associated with responses following stratification into good and poor treatment responders. As proof of concept, we translate the murine data to a population of depressed patients. We show that differences in expression profiles from baseline to week 12 of the human orthologues predict response status in patients. We finally provide evidence that sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor could be a potential key mechanism shaping response to antidepressant treatment.

"Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing of tumor samples and the ability to identify somatic mutations at low allelic fractions have opened the way for new approaches to model the evolution of individual cancers. The power and utility of these models is increased when tumor samples from multiple sites are sequenced. Temporal ordering of the samples may provide insight into the etiology of both primary and metastatic lesions and rationalizations for tumor recurrence and therapeutic failures. Additional insights may be provided by temporal ordering of evolving subclones—cellular subpopulations with unique mutational profiles. Current methods for subclone hierarchy inference tightly couple the problem of temporal ordering with that of estimating the fraction of cancer cells harboring each mutation. We present a new framework that includes a rigorous statistical hypothesis test and a collection of tools that make it possible to decouple these problems, which we believe will enable substantial progress in the field of subclone hierarchy inference. The methods presented here can be flexibly combined with methods developed by others addressing either of these problems. We provide tools to interpret hypothesis test results, which inform phylogenetic tree construction, and we introduce the first genetic algorithm designed for this purpose. The utility of our framework is systematically demonstrated in simulations. For most tested combinations of tumor purity, sequencing coverage, and tree complexity, good power (≥ 0.8) can be achieved and Type 1 error is well controlled when at least three tumor samples are available from a patient. Using data from three published multi-region tumor sequencing studies of (murine) small cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which the authors reconstructed subclonal phylogenetic trees by manual expert curation, we show how different configurations of our tools can identify either a single tree in agreement with the authors, or a small set of trees, which include the authors’ preferred tree. Our results have implications for improved modeling of tumor evolution and the importance of multi-region tumor sequencing.
","Cancer is a genetic disease, driven by DNA mutations. Each tumor is composed of millions of cells with differing genetic profiles that compete with each other for resources in a process similar to Darwinian evolution. We describe a computational framework to model tumor evolution on the cellular level, using next-generation sequencing. The framework is the first to apply a rigorous statistical hypothesis test designed to inform a new search algorithm. Both the test and the algorithm are based on evolutionary principles. The utility of the framework is shown in computer simulations and by automated reconstruction of the cellular evolution underlying murine small cell lung cancers, acute myeloid leukemias and chronic lymophocytic leukemias, from three recent published studies.

"The oscillations of the somitogenesis clock are linked to the fundamental process of vertebrate embryo segmentation, yet little is known about their generation. In zebrafish, it has been proposed that Her proteins repress the transcription of their own mRNA. However, in its simplest form, this model is incompatible with the fact that morpholino knockdown of Her proteins can impair expression of their mRNA. Simple self-repression models also do not account for the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression, with waves of gene expression shrinking as they propagate. Here we study computationally the networks generated by the wealth of dimerization possibilities amongst transcriptional repressors in the zebrafish somitogenesis clock. These networks can reproduce knockdown phenotypes, and strongly suggest the existence of a Her1–Her7 heterodimer, so far untested experimentally. The networks are the first reported to reproduce the spatiotemporal pattern of the zebrafish somitogenesis clock; they shed new light on the role of Her13.2, the only known link between the somitogenesis clock and positional information in the paraxial mesoderm. The networks can also account for perturbations of the clock by manipulation of FGF signaling. Achieving an understanding of the interplay between clock oscillations and positional information is a crucial first step in the investigation of the segmentation mechanism.
","Vertebrate embryos acquire a segmented structure along the anteroposterior axis. Segmentation is critical for patterning of other structures (such as nerves, vertebrae, muscles, and blood vessels) and occurs by the rhythmic separation of balls of cells, called somites, from the anterior end of their precursor tissue, called the presomitic mesoderm. These rhythmic events are associated with oscillatory gene expression in the presomitic mesoderm: waves of gene expression originate at the posterior end and spread anteriorly. When a wave reaches the anterior end, a pair of new somites detaches. The set of genes whose expression oscillates is termed the “somitogenesis clock.” Even though the zebrafish somitogenesis clock has been the subject of intensive study, it is not clear how its oscillations are generated. It has been proposed that the mechanism involves a simple negative feedback loop, with proteins of the Her family periodically repressing their own expression. However, this is incompatible with some experimental results and does not explain how the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression is generated. Here I propose a model—based on physical interactions between Her proteins—that is compatible with experimental results, and that explains how positional information is used to generate the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression.

"Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) in combination with single-molecule sequencing technology allows precision mapping of transcription start sites (TSSs) and genome-wide capture of promoter activities in differentiated and steady state cell populations. Much less is known about whether TSS profiling can characterize diverse and non-steady state cell populations, such as the approximately 400 transitory and heterogeneous cell types that arise during ontogeny of vertebrate animals. To gain such insight, we used the chick model and performed CAGE-based TSS analysis on embryonic samples covering the full 3-week developmental period. In total, 31,863 robust TSS peaks (>1 tag per million [TPM]) were mapped to the latest chicken genome assembly, of which 34% to 46% were active in any given developmental stage. ZENBU, a web-based, open-source platform, was used for interactive data exploration. TSSs of genes critical for lineage differentiation could be precisely mapped and their activities tracked throughout development, suggesting that non-steady state and heterogeneous cell populations are amenable to CAGE-based transcriptional analysis. Our study also uncovered a large set of extremely stable housekeeping TSSs and many novel stage-specific ones. We furthermore demonstrated that TSS mapping could expedite motif-based promoter analysis for regulatory modules associated with stage-specific and housekeeping genes. Finally, using Brachyury as an example, we provide evidence that precise TSS mapping in combination with Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-on technology enables us, for the first time, to efficiently target endogenous avian genes for transcriptional activation. Taken together, our results represent the first report of genome-wide TSS mapping in birds and the first systematic developmental TSS analysis in any amniote species (birds and mammals). By facilitating promoter-based molecular analysis and genetic manipulation, our work also underscores the value of avian models in unravelling the complex regulatory mechanism of cell lineage specification during amniote development.
","Early development cannot be studied in humans. Analysis of embryogenesis using avian models, which are phylogenetically closely related to mammals, can help us understand the complex regulatory mechanism of cell lineage specification during human development. We monitored the 3 weeks of chicken embryonic development from newly-laid egg to the point of hatching via CAGE expression profiling and revealed the first avian genome-wide set of genuine transcription start sites (TSSs) critical for differentiation and maturation from pregastrulation to hatching. By analyzing stage-specific expression profiles, we have identified enriched transcription factors responsible for lineage commitment and their corresponding regulatory modules. In addition, we reported a set of stable housekeeping genes more suitable for cross-sample normalization and calibration. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of a CAGE-based TSS dataset in developmental studies. Using the Brachyury gene as an example, we showed that CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing tools can be efficiently employed to target and transcriptionally activate the promoters of virtually any endogenous genes, enabled by the knowledge of their precise TSS locations. Our data, made available for easy exploration through the open ZENBU platform, represent an invaluable resource to study early development in amniotes.

"Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in young children in Africa. We examined factors associated with Cryptosporidium infection in MSD cases enrolled at the rural western Kenya Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) site from 2008-2012.
At health facility enrollment, stool samples were tested for enteric pathogens and data on clinical, environmental, and behavioral characteristics collected. Each child’s health status was recorded at 60-day follow-up. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Of the 1,778 children with MSD enrolled as cases in the GEMS-Kenya case-control study, 11% had Cryptosporidium detected in stool by enzyme immunoassay; in a genotyped subset, 81% were C. hominis. Among MSD cases, being an infant, having mucus in stool, and having prolonged/persistent duration diarrhea were associated with being Cryptosporidium-positive. Both boiling drinking water and using rainwater as the main drinking water source were protective factors for being Cryptosporidium-positive. At follow-up, Cryptosporidium-positive cases had increased odds of being stunted (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.06–2.57), underweight (aOR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.34–3.22), or wasted (aOR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.21–3.43), and had significantly larger negative changes in height- and weight-for-age z-scores from enrollment.
Cryptosporidium contributes significantly to diarrheal illness in young children in western Kenya. Advances in point of care detection, prevention/control approaches, effective water treatment technologies, and clinical management options for children with cryptosporidiosis are needed.
","Cryptosporidium is an important cause of childhood diarrhea. Research on cryptosporidiosis in countries where it is endemic remains limited; few studies have comprehensively examined risk factors for children in Kenya and similar settings. We examined characteristics associated with Cryptosporidium in children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea in rural western Kenya. We found there is little to clinically distinguish cryptosporidiosis from other childhood diarrhea in the absence of point of care diagnostics. Infants had the highest odds of Cryptosporidium infection; it has been previously established that Cryptosporidium infections in infancy can have severe consequences. Prolonged/persistent duration diarrhea and growth shortfalls were significantly more pronounced among cases with Cryptosporidium. Undernutrition and stunting in children in low- and middle-income countries have predicted decreased cognitive and school performance, thus long-term consequences could be appreciable. Using rainwater as the primary drinking water source and boiling drinking water were protective against Cryptosporidium infection, thus certain water sources may contribute to transmission. Like other studies in Kenya, we predominantly identified Cryptosporidium hominis, an anthropogenic species. Advances in point of care detection, prevention and control approaches, effective water treatment technologies, and clinical management options are needed to mitigate the potentially severe and long-term consequences of Cryptosporidium infection in children.

"Leprosy has a global presence; more than 180 thousand new cases were registered in 2013, 15% of which were found in the Americas. The elderly are a very susceptible demographic in terms of developing illnesses, mainly because of characteristics natural to the senescence of the human organism. This study’s goals were to analyze leprosy in an elderly population from a hyperendemic region of the Brazilian Amazon in a historical series from 2004 to 2013 and to determine the clinical and epidemiological profile of a series of leprosy cases of elderly people in the period spanning from 2009 to 2013.
To achieve these goals, an observational, longitudinal, retrospective and descriptive study was put together to analyze leprosy in elderly people from data acquired from the Notification Aggravations Information System. Furthermore, a profile of the disease from a retrospective cohort based on data collected from medical records was developed.
The number of new cases and the leprosy detection rate decreased across the observed period but remained stable among the elderly. The trend for the next ten years indicates decreases in the number of cases and in the detection rate in the general population and an increase in only the elderly. The overall profile was characterized by a predominance of males (64.32%), the multibacillary clinical form (87.57%), Type 1 reaction episodes (37.50%) and some physical incapacity at diagnosis (49.19%). The risk of reaction was greater in the first six months of multidrug therapy, and the positive result from the skin smear was associated with the greater chance of reactional condition development.
The resulting data demonstrate that leprosy amongst the elderly deserves attention because of the increased susceptibility to disability in this age group, with their higher risk of reaction and their greater level of co-morbidity.
","Leprosy, despite being an ancient disease, still represents a challenge to public health systems today. There are still just a few studies about it, particularly among the elderly. It is known that they constitute a very heterogeneous group in terms of immune response to infections, alterations to the peripheral nervous system and predisposition to situations of vulnerability and functional dependency. The Amazon region is a hyperendemic region for leprosy and has been trying to address, along with the rest of Brazil, a rapid increase in the population’s life expectancy. This article surveys medical records from elderly people diagnosed with leprosy in a five-year period at the metropolitan region of Belém, state of Pará (Brazil), identifying a predominance of the multibacillary forms of the disease, a high prevalence of leprosy reactions mainly during treatment with multidrug therapy, and the presence of some physical incapacity in most of the people evaluated. It is expected that this study will contribute to knowledge about the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of leprosy among the elderly and stimulate the making of new studies on the theme.

"The frequency and intensity of wildfires is anticipated to increase as climate change creates longer, warmer, and drier seasons. Particulate matter (PM) from wildfire smoke has been linked to adverse respiratory and possibly cardiovascular outcomes. Children, older adults, and persons with underlying respiratory and cardiovascular conditions are thought to be particularly vulnerable. This study examines the healthcare utilization of Medi-Cal recipients during the fall 2007 San Diego wildfires, which exposed millions of persons to wildfire smoke.
Respiratory and cardiovascular International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes were identified from Medi-Cal fee-for-service claims for emergency department presentations, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient visits. For a respiratory index and a cardiovascular index of key diagnoses and individual diagnoses, we calculated rate ratios (RRs) for the study population and different age groups for 3 consecutive 5-day exposure periods (P1 [October 22–26], P2 [October 27–31], and P3 [November 1–5]) versus pre-fire comparison periods matched on day of week (5-day periods starting 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 weeks before each exposed period). We used a bidirectional symmetric case-crossover design to examine emergency department presentations with any respiratory diagnosis and asthma specifically, with exposure based on modeled wildfire-derived fine inhalable particles that are 2.5 micrometers and smaller (PM2.5). We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for temperature and relative humidity, to assess same-day and moving averages. We also evaluated the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Air Quality Index (AQI) with this conditional logistic regression method. We identified 21,353 inpatient hospitalizations, 25,922 emergency department presentations, and 297,698 outpatient visits between August 16 and December 15, 2007. During P1, total emergency department presentations were no different than the reference periods (1,071 versus 1,062.2; RR 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95–1.08), those for respiratory diagnoses increased by 34% (288 versus 215.3; RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.18–1.52), and those for asthma increased by 112% (58 versus 27.3; RR 2.12; 95% CI 1.57–2.86). Some visit types continued to be elevated in later time frames, e.g., a 72% increase in outpatient visits for acute bronchitis in P2. Among children aged 0–4, emergency department presentations for respiratory diagnoses increased by 70% in P1, and very young children (0–1) experienced a 243% increase for asthma diagnoses. Associated with a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (72-hour moving average), we found 1.08 (95% CI 1.04–1.13) times greater odds of an emergency department presentation for asthma. The AQI level “unhealthy for sensitive groups” was associated with significantly elevated odds of an emergency department presentation for respiratory conditions the day following exposure, compared to the AQI level “good” (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.18–2.53). Study limitations include the use of patient home address to estimate exposures and demographic differences between Medi-Cal beneficiaries and the general population.
Respiratory diagnoses, especially asthma, were elevated during the wildfires in the vulnerable population of Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Wildfire-related healthcare utilization appeared to persist beyond the initial high-exposure period. Increased adverse health events were apparent even at mildly degraded AQI levels. Significant increases in health events, especially for respiratory conditions and among young children, are expected based on projected climate scenarios of wildfire frequency in California and globally.
","Large wildfires are becoming more frequent and are expected to increase with climate change. Smoke from wildfires can cause health problems, especially for children, older persons, and people who already have respiratory or heart problems.
Researchers had access to data on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits from California’s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. This allowed for analysis of the effects of wildfire among a particularly vulnerable population, which included a large proportion of young children. It also provided an opportunity to examine changes in outpatient visits.
Researchers were able to look at health problems during the time when the wildfire smoke was most intense and also at later periods to see if people had health problems that may take more time to develop. They chose to study a very large wildfire that happened in San Diego County in 2007.
During the peak fire period, emergency department visits for respiratory conditions increased by 34% and visits for asthma by 112%. There was no change in visits for heart-related problems.
Some healthcare visit types remained high even after the peak fire period. For example, outpatient visits for acute bronchitis were 72% above the usual rate in the 5-day period following the peak fire period.
Young children had bigger increases in visits during the peak fire period than older age groups. Children aged 0–4 had a 136% increase in emergency department visits for asthma, and very young children aged 0–1 experienced a 243% increase.
Researchers studied how health visits changed on days with more intense smoke using data from smoke models. Emergency department visits for asthma went up 73% on days following an air quality day designated as “unhealthy for sensitive populations,” based on wildfire smoke and using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Air Quality Index (AQI) air pollution levels as a guide.
We expect increases in respiratory problems during wildfires, possibly even at mildly degraded levels of air quality. People may continue to seek care for some persisting conditions.
Young children appear at highest risk for respiratory problems during a wildfire, which is cause for particular concern because of the potential for long-term harm to children’s lung development.
The risk of future wildfires on the health of Californians will continue to be shaped by global climate change, as well as the anticipated growth of vulnerable subpopulations. Planning to protect the health of vulnerable populations is important.

"As many malaria-endemic countries move towards elimination of Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria parasite, effective tools for monitoring malaria epidemiology are urgent priorities. P. falciparum population genetic approaches offer promising tools for understanding transmission and spread of the disease, but a high prevalence of multi-clone or polygenomic infections can render estimation of even the most basic parameters, such as allele frequencies, challenging. A previous method, COIL, was developed to estimate complexity of infection (COI) from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, but relies on monogenomic infections to estimate allele frequencies or requires external allele frequency data which may not available. Estimates limited to monogenomic infections may not be representative, however, and when the average COI is high, they can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Therefore, we developed THE REAL McCOIL, Turning HEterozygous SNP data into Robust Estimates of ALelle frequency, via Markov chain Monte Carlo, and Complexity Of Infection using Likelihood, to incorporate polygenomic samples and simultaneously estimate allele frequency and COI. This approach was tested via simulations then applied to SNP data from cross-sectional surveys performed in three Ugandan sites with varying malaria transmission. We show that THE REAL McCOIL consistently outperforms COIL on simulated data, particularly when most infections are polygenomic. Using field data we show that, unlike with COIL, we can distinguish epidemiologically relevant differences in COI between and within these sites. Surprisingly, for example, we estimated high average COI in a peri-urban subregion with lower transmission intensity, suggesting that many of these cases were imported from surrounding regions with higher transmission intensity. THE REAL McCOIL therefore provides a robust tool for understanding the molecular epidemiology of malaria across transmission settings.
","Monitoring malaria epidemiology is critical for evaluating the impact of interventions and designing strategies for control and elimination. Population genetics has been used to inform malaria epidemiology, but it is limited by the fact that a fundamental metric needed for most analyses—the frequency of alleles in a population—is difficult to estimate from blood samples containing more than one genetically distinct parasite (polygenomic infections). A widely used approach has been to restrict analysis to monogenomic infections, which may represent a biased subset and potentially ignores a large amount of data. Therefore, we developed a new analytical approach that uses data from all infections to simultaneously estimate allele frequency and the number of distinct parasites within each infection. The method, called THE REAL McCOIL, was evaluated using simulations and was then applied to data from cross-sectional surveys performed in three regions of Uganda. Simulations demonstrated accurate performance, and analyses of samples from Uganda using THE REAL McCOIL revealed epidemiologically relevant differences within and between the three regions that previous methods could not. THE REAL McCOIL thus facilitates population genetic analysis when there are polygenomic infections, which are common in many malaria endemic areas.

"Mammalian gene expression patterns, and their variability across populations of cells, are regulated by factors specific to each gene in concert with its surrounding cellular and genomic environment. Lentiviruses such as HIV integrate their genomes into semi-random genomic locations in the cells they infect, and the resulting viral gene expression provides a natural system to dissect the contributions of genomic environment to transcriptional regulation. Previously, we showed that expression heterogeneity and its modulation by specific host factors at HIV integration sites are key determinants of infected-cell fate and a possible source of latent infections. Here, we assess the integration context dependence of expression heterogeneity from diverse single integrations of a HIV-promoter/GFP-reporter cassette in Jurkat T-cells. Systematically fitting a stochastic model of gene expression to our data reveals an underlying transcriptional dynamic, by which multiple transcripts are produced during short, infrequent bursts, that quantitatively accounts for the wide, highly skewed protein expression distributions observed in each of our clonal cell populations. Interestingly, we find that the size of transcriptional bursts is the primary systematic covariate over integration sites, varying from a few to tens of transcripts across integration sites, and correlating well with mean expression. In contrast, burst frequencies are scattered about a typical value of several per cell-division time and demonstrate little correlation with the clonal means. This pattern of modulation generates consistently noisy distributions over the sampled integration positions, with large expression variability relative to the mean maintained even for the most productive integrations, and could contribute to specifying heterogeneous, integration-site-dependent viral production patterns in HIV-infected cells. Genomic environment thus emerges as a significant control parameter for gene expression variation that may contribute to structuring mammalian genomes, as well as be exploited for survival by integrating viruses.
","Cellular gene expression is a fundamentally stochastic process due to the intrinsic randomness of the underlying biochemical reactions involved. The resulting stochastically generated expression heterogeneities have important biological consequences and also encode information about the underlying dynamics that generate them. A fundamental goal of transcriptional biology is to understand the quantitative regulation of gene-expression dynamics, which in eukaryotes depends on factors specific to each gene in concert with its surrounding cellular and genomic environment. We investigated the regulatory effects of variable genomic environments by quantitatively measuring expression heterogeneity from diverse single genomic integrations of the HIV promoter in cultured cells. Systematically fitting a model of stochastic gene expression to our measurements reveals transcript production in bursts as the underlying dynamic that accounts for the large heterogeneities observed within single-integration clonal cell populations, with the size of transcriptional bursts as the primary feature that varies over genomic integrations. Our findings implicate genomic environment as an important quantitative control parameter that eukaryotic cells might use to shape gene-expression patterns, and that lentviruses such as HIV, whose genomes are semi-randomly integrated into the genomes of the host cells they infect, may exploit to sample diverse and heterogeneous expression patterns that evade treatment.

"Many enteropathogenic bacteria target the mammalian gut. The mechanisms protecting the host from infection are poorly understood. We have studied the protective functions of secretory antibodies (sIgA) and the microbiota, using a mouse model for S. typhimurium diarrhea. This pathogen is a common cause of diarrhea in humans world-wide. S. typhimurium (S. tmatt, sseD) causes a self-limiting gut infection in streptomycin-treated mice. After 40 days, all animals had overcome the disease, developed a sIgA response, and most had cleared the pathogen from the gut lumen. sIgA limited pathogen access to the mucosal surface and protected from gut inflammation in challenge infections. This protection was O-antigen specific, as demonstrated with pathogens lacking the S. typhimurium O-antigen (wbaP, S. enteritidis) and sIgA-deficient mice (TCRβ−/−δ−/−, JH−/−, IgA−/−, pIgR−/−). Surprisingly, sIgA-deficiency did not affect the kinetics of pathogen clearance from the gut lumen. Instead, this was mediated by the microbiota. This was confirmed using ‘L-mice’ which harbor a low complexity gut flora, lack colonization resistance and develop a normal sIgA response, but fail to clear S. tmatt from the gut lumen. In these mice, pathogen clearance was achieved by transferring a normal complex microbiota. Thus, besides colonization resistance ( = pathogen blockage by an intact microbiota), the microbiota mediates a second, novel protective function, i.e. pathogen clearance. Here, the normal microbiota re-grows from a state of depletion and disturbed composition and gradually clears even very high pathogen loads from the gut lumen, a site inaccessible to most “classical” immune effector mechanisms. In conclusion, sIgA and microbiota serve complementary protective functions. The microbiota confers colonization resistance and mediates pathogen clearance in primary infections, while sIgA protects from disease if the host re-encounters the same pathogen. This has implications for curing S. typhimurium diarrhea and for preventing transmission.
","Numerous pathogens infect the gut. Protection against these infections is mediated by mucosal immune defenses including secreted IgA as well as by the competing intestinal microbiota. However, so far the relative importance of these two different defense mechanisms remains unclear. We addressed this question using the example of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) gut infections which can be spread in stool of infected patients over long periods of time. We used a mouse model to reveal that the intestinal microbiota and the adaptive immune system hold different but complementary functions in fighting NTS infections. A primary Salmonella infection disrupts the normal microbiota and elicits Salmonella-specific sIgA. sIgA prevents disease when the animal is infected with NTS for a second time. However, sIgA was dispensable for pathogen clearance from the gut. Instead, this was mediated by the microbiota. By re-establishing its normal density and composition, the microbiota was necessary and sufficient for terminating long-term fecal Salmonella excretion. This establishes a novel paradigm: The microbiota clears the pathogen from the gut lumen, while sIgA protects from disease upon re-infection with the same pathogen. This has implications for the evolutionary role of sIgA responses as well as for developing microbiota-based therapies for curing infected patients.

"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) US2, US3, US6 and US11 act in concert to prevent immune recognition of virally infected cells by CD8+ T-lymphocytes through downregulation of MHC class I molecules (MHC-I). Here we show that US2 function goes far beyond MHC-I degradation. A systematic proteomic study using Plasma Membrane Profiling revealed US2 was unique in downregulating additional cellular targets, including: five distinct integrin α-chains, CD112, the interleukin-12 receptor, PTPRJ and thrombomodulin. US2 recruited the cellular E3 ligase TRC8 to direct the proteasomal degradation of all its targets, reminiscent of its degradation of MHC-I. Whereas integrin α-chains were selectively degraded, their integrin β1 binding partner accumulated in the ER. Consequently integrin signaling, cell adhesion and migration were strongly suppressed. US2 was necessary and sufficient for degradation of the majority of its substrates, but remarkably, the HCMV NK cell evasion function UL141 requisitioned US2 to enhance downregulation of the NK cell ligand CD112. UL141 retained CD112 in the ER from where US2 promoted its TRC8-dependent retrotranslocation and degradation. These findings redefine US2 as a multifunctional degradation hub which, through recruitment of the cellular E3 ligase TRC8, modulates diverse immune pathways involved in antigen presentation, NK cell activation, migration and coagulation; and highlight US2’s impact on HCMV pathogenesis.
","As the largest human herpesvirus, HCMV is a paradigm of viral immune evasion and has evolved multiple mechanisms to evade immune detection and enable survival. The HCMV genes US2, US3, US6 and US11 promote virus persistence by their ability to downregulate cell surface MHC. We developed ‘Plasma Membrane Profiling’ (PMP), an unbiased SILAC-based proteomics technique to ask whether MHC molecules are the only focus of these genes, or whether additional cellular immunoreceptors are also targeted. PMP compares the relative abundance of cell surface receptors between control and viral gene expressing cells. We found that whereas US3, US6 and US11 were remarkably MHC specific, US2 modulated expression of a wide variety of cell surface immunoreceptors. US2-mediated proteasomal degradation of integrin α-chains blocked integrin signaling and suppressed cell adhesion and migration. All US2 substrates were degraded via the cellular E3 ligase TRC8, and in a remarkable example of cooperativity between HCMV immune-evasins, UL141 requisitioned US2 to target the NK cell ligand CD112 for proteasomal degradation. HCMV US2 and UL141 are therefore modulators of multiple immune-related pathways and act as a multifunctional degradation hub that inhibits the migration, immune recognition and killing of HCMV-infected cells.

"Fundamental to biological decision-making is the ability to generate bimodal expression patterns where 2 alternate expression states simultaneously exist. Here, we use a combination of single-cell analysis and mathematical modeling to examine the sources of bimodality in the transcriptional program controlling HIV’s fate decision between active replication and viral latency. We find that the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein manipulates the intrinsic toggling of HIV’s promoter, the long terminal repeat (LTR), to generate bimodal ON-OFF expression and that transcriptional positive feedback from Tat shifts and expands the regime of LTR bimodality. This result holds for both minimal synthetic viral circuits and full-length virus. Strikingly, computational analysis indicates that the Tat circuit’s noncooperative “nonlatching” feedback architecture is optimized to slow the promoter’s toggling and generate bimodality by stochastic extinction of Tat. In contrast to the standard Poisson model, theory and experiment show that nonlatching positive feedback substantially dampens the inverse noise-mean relationship to maintain stochastic bimodality despite increasing mean expression levels. Given the rapid evolution of HIV, the presence of a circuit optimized to robustly generate bimodal expression appears consistent with the hypothesis that HIV’s decision between active replication and latency provides a viral fitness advantage. More broadly, the results suggest that positive-feedback circuits may have evolved not only for signal amplification but also for robustly generating bimodality by decoupling expression fluctuations (noise) from mean expression levels.
","A central and recurring feature of cell-fate regulating circuits is their ability to generate bimodal expression—2 alternate expression states that exist simultaneously—with each state corresponding to a different cell fate. To understand the mechanisms enabling bimodality in a natural decision-making circuit, we examined HIV’s fate-selection circuit, the Tat circuit. This bimodal circuit is sufficient and necessary to generate a bet-hedging decision between 2 alternate HIV fates: active viral replication and long-lived dormancy (proviral latency). The dormant state, which is resistant to most antiviral drugs, is the primary clinical barrier to curing an HIV infection. While the canonical role of positive feedback is to amplify a signal, surprisingly, we find that the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) positive-feedback architecture is instead optimized to expand the regime of HIV expression bimodality. From an evolutionary perspective, the results suggest that positive-feedback circuits may have evolved to robustly generate bimodality in certain contexts, and, given the rapid evolution of HIV, the presence of a circuit optimized to robustly generate bimodal expression patterns appears to support the hypothesis that HIV’s active-versus-latent decision confers viral fitness.

"In budding yeast, an HO endonuclease-inducible double-strand break (DSB) is efficiently repaired by several homologous recombination (HR) pathways. In contrast to gene conversion (GC), where both ends of the DSB can recombine with the same template, break-induced replication (BIR) occurs when only the centromere-proximal end of the DSB can locate homologous sequences. Whereas GC results in a small patch of new DNA synthesis, BIR leads to a nonreciprocal translocation. The requirements for completing BIR are significantly different from those of GC, but both processes require 5′ to 3′ resection of DSB ends to create single-stranded DNA that leads to formation of a Rad51 filament required to initiate HR. Resection proceeds by two pathways dependent on Exo1 or the BLM homolog, Sgs1. We report that Exo1 and Sgs1 each inhibit BIR but have little effect on GC, while overexpression of either protein severely inhibits BIR. In contrast, overexpression of Rad51 markedly increases the efficiency of BIR, again with little effect on GC. In sgs1Δ exo1Δ strains, where there is little 5′ to 3′ resection, the level of BIR is not different from either single mutant; surprisingly, there is a two-fold increase in cell viability after HO induction whereby 40% of all cells survive by formation of a new telomere within a few kb of the site of DNA cleavage. De novo telomere addition is rare in wild-type, sgs1Δ, or exo1Δ cells. In sgs1Δ exo1Δ, repair by GC is severely inhibited, but cell viaiblity remains high because of new telomere formation. These data suggest that the extensive 5′ to 3′ resection that occurs before the initiation of new DNA synthesis in BIR may prevent efficient maintenance of a Rad51 filament near the DSB end. The severe constraint on 5′ to 3′ resection, which also abrogates activation of the Mec1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint, permits an unprecedented level of new telomere addition.
","A chromosomal double-strand break (DSB) poses a severe threat to genome integrity, and budding yeast cells use several homologous recombination mechanisms to repair the break. In gene conversion (GC), both ends of the DSB share homology to an intact donor locus, and the break is repaired by copying the donor to create a small patch of new DNA synthesis. In break-induced replication (BIR), only one side of the DSB shares homology to a donor, and repair involves assembly of a recombination-dependent replication fork that copies sequences to the end of the template chromosome, yielding a nonreciprocal translocation. Both processes require that the DSB ends be resected by 5′ to 3′ exonucleases, involving several proteins or protein complexes, including Exo1 and Sgs1-Rmi1-Top3-Dna2. We report that ectopic BIR is inhibited independently by Sgs1 and Exo1 and that overexpression of Rad51 recombinase further improves BIR, while GC is largely unaffected. Surprisingly, when both Sgs1 and Exo1 are deleted, and resection is severely impaired, half of the cells acquire new telomeres rather than completing BIR or GC. New telomere addition appears to result from the lack of resection itself and from the fact that, without resection, the Mec1 (ATR) DNA damage checkpoint fails to inactivate the Pif1 helicase that discourages new telomere formation.

"Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.
","What explains the geographic dispersal of emerging pathogens? Reconstructions of evolutionary history from pathogen gene sequences offer qualitative descriptions of spatial spread, but current approaches are poorly equipped to formally test and quantify the contribution of different potential explanatory factors, such as human mobility and demography. Here, we use a novel phylogeographic method to evaluate multiple potential predictors of viral spread in human influenza dynamics. We identify air travel as the predominant driver of global influenza migration, whilst also revealing the contribution of other mobility processes at more local scales. We demonstrate the power of our inter-disciplinary approach by using it to predict the global pandemic expansion of H1N1 influenza in 2009. Our study highlights the importance of integrating evolutionary and ecological information when studying the dynamics of infectious disease.

"Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs) play a critical role in controlling viral
                    infections. HIV-infected individuals develop CTL responses against epitopes
                    derived from viral proteins, but also against cryptic epitopes encoded by viral
                    alternative reading frames (ARF). We studied here the mechanisms of HIV-1 escape
                    from CTLs targeting one such cryptic epitope, Q9VF, encoded by an
                        HIVgag ARF and presented by HLA-B*07. Using PBMCs of
                    HIV-infected patients, we first cloned and sequenced proviral DNA encoding for
                    Q9VF. We identified several polymorphisms with a minority of proviruses encoding
                    at position 5 an aspartic acid (Q9VF/5D) and a majority encoding an asparagine
                    (Q9VF/5N). We compared the prevalence of each variant in PBMCs of
                    HLA-B*07+ and HLA-B*07- patients. Proviruses encoding Q9VF/5D were
                    significantly less represented in HLA-B*07+ than in HLA-B*07-
                    patients, suggesting that Q9FV/5D encoding viruses might be under selective
                    pressure in HLA-B*07+ individuals. We thus analyzed ex
                        vivo CTL responses directed against Q9VF/5D and Q9VF/5N. Around
                    16% of HLA-B*07+ patients exhibited CTL responses targeting Q9VF
                    epitopes. The frequency and the magnitude of CTL responses induced with Q9VF/5D
                    or Q9VF/5N peptides were almost equal indicating a possible cross-reactivity of
                    the same CTLs on the two peptides. We then dissected the cellular mechanisms
                    involved in the presentation of Q9VF variants. As expected, cells infected with
                    HIV strains encoding for Q9VF/5D were recognized by Q9VF/5D-specific CTLs. In
                    contrast, Q9VF/5N-encoding strains were neither recognized by Q9VF/5N- nor by
                    Q9VF/5D-specific CTLs. Using in vitro proteasomal digestions
                    and MS/MS analysis, we demonstrate that the 5N variation introduces a strong
                    proteasomal cleavage site within the epitope, leading to a dramatic reduction of
                    Q9VF epitope production. Our results strongly suggest that HIV-1 escapes CTL
                    surveillance by introducing mutations leading to HIV ARF-epitope destruction by
                    proteasomes.
","In addition to the classical open reading frames encoding for the well
                    characterized HIV proteins, HIV exhibits a vast number of alternative reading
                    frames that have the potential to encode proteins or polypeptides. We have
                    previously shown that such reading frames within gag, pol and
                        env genes express T cell epitopes. In the present work, we
                    further characterized the role of T-cell responses targeting the
                        gag-overlapping reading frame in the selection of HIV
                    variants in vivo. We demonstrate that under CD8+ T cell
                    immune pressure, HIV escapes by introducing mutation that affects T-cell
                    recognition of HIV-infected cells. We characterized the mechanism of CTL-escape
                    and demonstrate that HIV manipulates antigen processing and presentation. Our
                    results highlight the importance of CTL targeting these alternative reading
                    frame-encoded antigens in the control of HIV replication.

"While the high prevalence of preterm births and its impact on infant mortality in the US have been widely acknowledged, recent data suggest that even full-term births in the US face substantially higher mortality risks compared to European countries with low infant mortality rates. In this paper, we use the most recent birth records in the US to more closely analyze the primary causes underlying mortality rates among full-term births.
Linked birth and death records for the period 2010–2012 were used to identify the state- and cause-specific burden of infant mortality among full-term infants (born at 37–42 weeks of gestation). Multivariable logistic models were used to assess the extent to which state-level differences in full-term infant mortality (FTIM) were attributable to observed differences in maternal and birth characteristics. Random effects models were used to assess the relative contribution of state-level variation to FTIM. Hypothetical mortality outcomes were computed under the assumption that all states could achieve the survival rates of the best-performing states. A total of 10,175,481 infants born full-term in the US between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012, were analyzed. FTIM rate (FTIMR) was 2.2 per 1,000 live births overall, and ranged between 1.29 (Connecticut, 95% CI 1.08, 1.53) and 3.77 (Mississippi, 95% CI 3.39, 4.19) at the state level. Zero states reached the rates reported in the 6 low-mortality European countries analyzed (FTIMR < 1.25), and 13 states had FTIMR > 2.75. Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) accounted for 43% of FTIM; congenital malformations and perinatal conditions accounted for 31% and 11.3% of FTIM, respectively. The largest mortality differentials between states with good and states with poor FTIMR were found for SUDI, with particularly large risk differentials for deaths due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (odds ratio [OR] 2.52, 95% CI 1.86, 3.42) and suffocation (OR 4.40, 95% CI 3.71, 5.21). Even though these mortality differences were partially explained by state-level differences in maternal education, race, and maternal health, substantial state-level variation in infant mortality remained in fully adjusted models (SIDS OR 1.45, suffocation OR 2.92). The extent to which these state differentials are due to differential antenatal care standards as well as differential access to health services could not be determined due to data limitations. Overall, our estimates suggest that infant mortality could be reduced by 4,003 deaths (95% CI 2,284, 5,587) annually if all states were to achieve the mortality levels of the best-performing state in each cause-of-death category. Key limitations of the analysis are that information on termination rates at the state level was not available, and that causes of deaths may have been coded differentially across states.
More than 7,000 full-term infants die in the US each year. The results presented in this paper suggest that a substantial share of these deaths may be preventable. Potential improvements seem particularly large for SUDI, where very low rates have been achieved in a few states while average mortality rates remain high in most other areas. Given the high mortality burden due to SIDS and suffocation, policy efforts to promote compliance with recommended sleeping arrangements could be an effective first step in this direction.
","High infant mortality rates in the US compared to other high-income countries have been well documented in the literature.
Most of this literature primarily attributes high infant mortality in the US to the high rates of prematurity.
Relatively little is known regarding the survival of infants born full-term.
We compared state-level mortality rates among full-term infants in the US to that of 6 European countries with low mortality rates.
We showed that infants born full-term in the US face 50%–200% higher risks of infant mortality compared to these European countries.
We found that the largest proportion of infant deaths among children born full-term in the US was due to sudden unexpected deaths of infants, which comprised both sudden infant death syndrome and other unexpected causes such as suffocation and violence.
Major improvements in full-term infant mortality (through increases in full-term infant survival and increases in pregnancy terminations) seem possible in the US.
More research is needed to identify the most effective policies to achieve this objective.

"Protein-ligand recognition plays key roles in many biological processes. One of the most fascinating questions about protein-ligand recognition is to understand its underlying mechanism, which often results from a combination of induced fit and conformational selection. In this study, we have developed a three-pronged approach of Markov State Models, Molecular Dynamics simulations, and flux analysis to determine the contribution of each model. Using this approach, we have quantified the recognition mechanism of the choline binding protein (ChoX) to be ∼90% conformational selection dominant under experimental conditions. This is achieved by recovering all the necessary parameters for the flux analysis in combination with available experimental data. Our results also suggest that ChoX has several metastable conformational states, of which an apo-closed state is dominant, consistent with previous experimental findings. Our methodology holds great potential to be widely applied to understand recognition mechanisms underlining many fundamental biological processes.
","Molecular recognition plays important roles in numerous biological processes including gene regulation, cell signaling and enzymatic activity. It has been suggested that molecular recognition employs a variety of mechanisms, ranging from induced fit to conformational selection. In many realistic systems, conformational selection and induced fit are not mutually exclusive. An analytical flux analysis has been developed to determine the contribution of each model, but it is extremely challenging to obtain the necessary kinetic parameters for this flux analysis through experimental techniques. In this work, we have developed an approach integrating Markov State Models, molecular dynamics simulations, and flux analysis to tackle this problem. Using this approach, we have quantified the recognition mechanism of the choline binding protein to be ∼90% conformational selection dominant in the experimental conditions. Our methodology provides a way to quantify the molecular recognition mechanisms that are extremely difficult to be directly accessed by experiments. This opens up numerous possibilities for in silico design to fine tune the recognition event either to increase the degree of conformational selection or induced fit, so that new properties could be created to accommodate the needs of protein engineering, drug development and beyond.

"Reptile-associated Salmonella bacteria are a major, but often neglected cause of both gastrointestinal and bloodstream infection in humans globally. The diversity of Salmonella enterica has not yet been determined in venomous snakes, however other ectothermic animals have been reported to carry a broad range of Salmonella bacteria. We investigated the prevalence and diversity of Salmonella in a collection of venomous snakes and non-venomous reptiles.
We used a combination of selective enrichment techniques to establish a unique dataset of reptilian isolates to study Salmonella enterica species-level evolution and ecology and used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the relatedness of phylogenetic groups. We observed that 91% of venomous snakes carried Salmonella, and found that a diverse range of serovars (n = 58) were carried by reptiles. The Salmonella serovars belonged to four of the six Salmonella enterica subspecies: diarizonae, enterica, houtanae and salamae. Subspecies enterica isolates were distributed among two distinct phylogenetic clusters, previously described as clade A (52%) and clade B (48%). We identified metabolic differences between S. diarizonae, S. enterica clade A and clade B involving growth on lactose, tartaric acid, dulcitol, myo-inositol and allantoin.
We present the first whole genome-based comparative study of the Salmonella bacteria that colonise venomous and non-venomous reptiles and shed new light on Salmonella evolution. Venomous snakes examined in this study carried a broad range of Salmonella, including serovars which have been associated with disease in humans such as S. Enteritidis. The findings raise the possibility that venomous snakes could be a reservoir for Salmonella serovars associated with human salmonellosis.
","Salmonella enterica is a remarkable bacterial species that causes Neglected Tropical Diseases globally. The burden of disease is greatest in some of the most poverty-afflicted regions of Africa, where salmonellosis frequently causes bloodstream infection with fatal consequences. The bacteria have the ability to colonise the gastrointestinal tract of a wide range of animals including reptiles. Direct or indirect contact between reptiles and humans can cause salmonellosis. In this study, we determined the prevalence and diversity of Salmonella in a collection of African venomous snakes for the first time. We showed that the majority of venomous snakes (91%) in our study carry Salmonella, and used bacterial genomics to assign two thirds of isolates to the S. enterica subspecies enterica which is associated with human salmonellosis. We identified two evolutionary groups of S. enterica subspecies enterica that display distinct metabolic profiles with infection-relevant carbon sources. Our findings could have a broad significance because venomous snakes can move freely around human dwellings in tropical regions of the world such as Africa, and could potentially shed contaminated faecal matter onto surfaces and into water supplies.

"Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of loci for a range of human complex traits and diseases. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by significant associations is, however, limited. Given the same dense SNP panels, mixed model analyses capture a greater proportion of phenotypic variance than single SNP analyses but the total is generally still less than the genetic variance estimated from pedigree studies. Combining information from pedigree relationships and SNPs, we examined 16 complex anthropometric and cardiometabolic traits in a Scottish family-based cohort comprising up to 20,000 individuals genotyped for ~520,000 common autosomal SNPs. The inclusion of related individuals provides the opportunity to also estimate the genetic variance associated with pedigree as well as the effects of common family environment. Trait variation was partitioned into SNP-associated and pedigree-associated genetic variation, shared nuclear family environment, shared couple (partner) environment and shared full-sibling environment. Results demonstrate that trait heritabilities vary widely but, on average across traits, SNP-associated and pedigree-associated genetic effects each explain around half the genetic variance. For most traits the recently-shared environment of couples is also significant, accounting for ~11% of the phenotypic variance on average. On the other hand, the environment shared largely in the past by members of a nuclear family or by full-siblings, has a more limited impact. Our findings point to appropriate models to use in future studies as pedigree-associated genetic effects and couple environmental effects have seldom been taken into account in genotype-based analyses. Appropriate description of the trait variation could help understand causes of intra-individual variation and in the detection of contributing loci and environmental factors.
","Unravelling overall trait architecture of complex traits and diseases is important for phenotype prediction and disease prevention and correct modelling of the trait will further aid discovery of causative loci. Here we take advantage of genome-wide data and a large family-based study to examine the role of common genetic variants, pedigree-associated genetic variants, shared family environment, shared couple environment and shared sibling environment on 16 anthropometric and cardiometabolic traits. By analysing up to ~20,000 Scottish individuals, we find that common genetic variants, pedigree-associated genetic variants and recently-shared environment of couples are the most important contributors to variation in these traits, while past family and sibling environment have a limited impact. Further studies on the pedigree-associated genetic variation and the shared couple environment effect are needed, as little research has been devoted to them so far.

"Despite recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of ectodermal dysplasias (EDs), the molecular basis of many of these disorders remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed at elucidating the genetic basis of a new form of ED featuring facial dysmorphism, scalp hypotrichosis and hypodontia. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified 2 frameshift and 2 missense mutations in TSPEAR segregating with the disease phenotype in 3 families. TSPEAR encodes the thrombospondin-type laminin G domain and EAR repeats (TSPEAR) protein, whose function is poorly understood. TSPEAR knock-down resulted in altered expression of genes known to be regulated by NOTCH and to be involved in murine hair and tooth development. Pathway analysis confirmed that down-regulation of TSPEAR in keratinocytes is likely to affect Notch signaling. Accordingly, using a luciferase-based reporter assay, we showed that TSPEAR knock-down is associated with decreased Notch signaling. In addition, NOTCH1 protein expression was reduced in patient scalp skin. Moreover, TSPEAR silencing in mouse hair follicle organ cultures was found to induce apoptosis in follicular epithelial cells, resulting in decreased hair bulb diameter. Collectively, these observations indicate that TSPEAR plays a critical, previously unrecognized role in human tooth and hair follicle morphogenesis through regulation of the Notch signaling pathway.
","Ectodermal dysplasias refer to a large group of inherited disorders characterized by developmental defects in tissues of ectodermal origin. The study of these conditions has been instrumental in the discovery of biological pathways involved in the regulation of epithelial tissue morphogenesis. In this report, through the delineation of the molecular basis of a novel form of autosomal recessive ectodermal dysplasia, we identified a new key player in ectodermal development. We detected a number of mutations in TSPEAR co-segregating with abnormal hair and tooth development in three families. TSPEAR encodes the thrombospondin-type laminin G domain and EAR repeats (TSPEAR) protein, whose function is poorly understood. TSPEAR was found to be strongly expressed in murine hair and tooth. Using a reporter assay, we showed that it regulates Notch activity. Accordingly, NOTCH1 expression was altered in patient skin, and NOTCH1, as well as many of its known targets, was down-regulated in TSPEAR deficient keratinocytes. Moreover, Tspear silencing in mouse hair follicle organ cultures was found to induce apoptosis in follicular epithelial cells, resulting in decreased hair bulb diameter. Collectively, these observations indicate that TSPEAR plays a critical, previously unrecognized role in human tooth and hair follicle morphogenesis through regulation of the Notch pathway. As such, these new data are likely to lead to further investigations aimed at characterizing the role of Notch signaling pathway in other forms of ectodermal dysplasias as well as acquired hair and tooth pathologies.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common solid tumor in the world and the third leading cause of cancer-associated deaths. A Sleeping Beauty-mediated transposon mutagenesis screen previously identified mutations that cooperate with MYC to accelerate liver tumorigenesis. This revealed a tumor suppressor role for Steroid Receptor Coactivator 2/Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2 (Src-2/Ncoa2) in liver cancer. In contrast, SRC-2 promotes survival and metastasis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a tissue-specific and context-dependent role for SRC-2 in tumorigenesis. To determine if genetic loss of SRC-2 is sufficient to accelerate MYC-mediated liver tumorigenesis, we bred Src-2-/- mice with a MYC-induced liver tumor model and observed a significant increase in liver tumor burden. RNA sequencing of liver tumors and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a set of direct target genes that are bound by SRC-2 and exhibit downregulated expression in Src-2-/- liver tumors. We demonstrate that activation of SHP (Small Heterodimer Partner), DKK4 (Dickkopf-4), and CADM4 (Cell Adhesion Molecule 4) by SRC-2 suppresses tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that SRC-2 may exhibit oncogenic or tumor suppressor activity depending on the target genes and nuclear receptors that are expressed in distinct tissues and illuminate the mechanisms of tumor suppression by SRC-2 in liver.
","Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide with limited responses to targeted therapies. An unbiased forward genetic screen previously revealed a tumor suppressor role for the Steroid Receptor Coactivator 2 (Src-2) in liver cancer driven by the MYC oncogene. Yet, SRC-2 has been shown to promote survival and metastasis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a tissue-specific and context-dependent role for SRC-2 in tumorigenesis. Through the use of mice lacking SRC-2, we provide unequivocal evidence that this protein restrains MYC-induced liver tumorigenesis, and we have begun to identify key downstream SRC-2 target genes that mediate this effect. This work provides important new insights into the mechanism of tumor suppression by SRC-2 in MYC-induced liver cancer. Our study also suggests that SRC-2 may exhibit oncogenic or tumor suppressor activity depending on the target genes and nuclear receptors that are expressed in distinct tissues.

"Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease that causes considerable morbidity and mortality globally, primarily in residents of urban slums. While contact with contaminated water plays a critical role in the transmission of leptospirosis, little is known about the distribution and abundance of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in soil and the potential contribution of this source to human infection.
We collected soil samples (n = 70) from three sites within an urban slum community endemic for leptospirosis in Salvador, Brazil. Using qPCR of Leptospira genes lipl32 and 16S rRNA, we quantified the pathogenic Leptospira load in each soil sample. lipl32 qPCR detected pathogenic Leptospira in 22 (31%) of 70 samples, though the median concentration among positive samples was low (median = 6 GEq/g; range: 4–4.31×102 GEq/g). We also observed heterogeneity in the distribution of pathogenic Leptospira at the fine spatial scale. However, when using 16S rRNA qPCR, we detected a higher proportion of Leptospira-positive samples (86%) and higher bacterial concentrations (median: 4.16×102 GEq/g; range: 4–2.58×104 GEq/g). Sequencing of the qPCR amplicons and qPCR analysis with all type Leptospira species revealed that the 16S rRNA qPCR detected not only pathogenic Leptospira but also intermediate species, although both methods excluded saprophytic Leptospira. No significant associations were identified between the presence of pathogenic Leptospira DNA and environmental characteristics (vegetation, rat activity, distance to an open sewer or a house, or soil clay content), though samples with higher soil moisture content showed higher prevalences.
This is the first study to successfully quantify the burden of pathogenic Leptospira in soil from an endemic region. Our results support the hypothesis that soil may be an under-recognized environmental reservoir contributing to transmission of pathogenic Leptospira in urban slums. Consequently, the role of soil should be considered when planning interventions aimed to reduce the burden of leptospirosis in these communities.
","Leptospirosis is a globally distributed zoonotic disease that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in urban slums. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with water, soil, or mud that has been contaminated with infected urine shed from chronically infected animals. Despite the critical role the environment plays in the epidemiology of the disease, the contribution of soil to the transmission cycle remains largely undescribed. Herein, we investigated the distribution of pathogenic Leptospira in soil samples from an endemic urban slum in Brazil. We found pathogenic Leptospira in nearly one-third of the soil samples, predominantly in low concentrations (<5×102 GEq/g). However, we observed considerable variation in the distribution and concentration of the pathogen at the fine spatial scale within the slum. Our results indicate that soil is likely an important additional environmental reservoir of pathogenic Leptospira in urban slums and prevention strategies should consider soil to help prevent the transmission of the disease in similar settings.

"Motion tracking is a challenge the visual system has to solve by reading out the retinal population. It is still unclear how the information from different neurons can be combined together to estimate the position of an object. Here we recorded a large population of ganglion cells in a dense patch of salamander and guinea pig retinas while displaying a bar moving diffusively. We show that the bar’s position can be reconstructed from retinal activity with a precision in the hyperacuity regime using a linear decoder acting on 100+ cells. We then took advantage of this unprecedented precision to explore the spatial structure of the retina’s population code. The classical view would have suggested that the firing rates of the cells form a moving hill of activity tracking the bar’s position. Instead, we found that most ganglion cells in the salamander fired sparsely and idiosyncratically, so that their neural image did not track the bar. Furthermore, ganglion cell activity spanned an area much larger than predicted by their receptive fields, with cells coding for motion far in their surround. As a result, population redundancy was high, and we could find multiple, disjoint subsets of neurons that encoded the trajectory with high precision. This organization allows for diverse collections of ganglion cells to represent high-accuracy motion information in a form easily read out by downstream neural circuits.
","It remains unclear how the brain is able to track the location of moving objects by reading the spike trains received from the retina. To address this question, we recorded a large population of ganglion cells, the retinal output, in a dense patch of salamander and guinea pig retinas while displaying a bar moving in complex motion. From previous studies, the naive expectation was that individual ganglion cells would spike when an object was moving on their receptive field center and that the entire population’s activity would resemble a “hill” that continuously tracked the object’s location. However, our analysis revealed that this picture did not hold. Instead, ganglion cells fired sparsely and coded for the bar trajectory even when it was far from their receptive field center. Nevertheless, we showed that the bar’s position could be reconstructed from retinal activity with an accuracy better than the spacing between photoreceptors, when using more than 100 cells. We also showed that the retinal code was highly redundant, over-representing the same information more than 6-fold. Yet, this unexpected representation allowed for precise object tracking using a simple decoder, as long as the temporal structure of the spike trains was accounted for.

"Pre-mRNA splicing is a critical step of gene expression in eukaryotes. Transcriptome-wide splicing patterns are complex and primarily regulated by a diverse set of recognition elements and associated RNA-binding proteins. The retention and splicing (RES) complex is formed by three different proteins (Bud13p, Pml1p and Snu17p) and is involved in splicing in yeast. However, the importance of the RES complex for vertebrate splicing, the intronic features associated with its activity, and its role in development are unknown. In this study, we have generated loss-of-function mutants for the three components of the RES complex in zebrafish and showed that they are required during early development. The mutants showed a marked neural phenotype with increased cell death in the brain and a decrease in differentiated neurons. Transcriptomic analysis of bud13, snip1 (pml1) and rbmx2 (snu17) mutants revealed a global defect in intron splicing, with strong mis-splicing of a subset of introns. We found these RES-dependent introns were short, rich in GC and flanked by GC depleted exons, all of which are features associated with intron definition. Using these features, we developed and validated a predictive model that classifies RES dependent introns. Altogether, our study uncovers the essential role of the RES complex during vertebrate development and provides new insights into its function during splicing.
","RES complex is essential for splicing in yeast but its function and role during vertebrate development are unknown. Here, we combined genetic loss-of-function mutants with transcriptomic analysis and found that a subset of introns is particularly affected in RES complex knock-out background. Those introns display the major hallmarks of splicing through intron definition mechanisms (short introns, rich in GC and flanked by GC depleted exons). Moreover, bud13, rbmx2 and snip1 mutant embryos showed a marked brain phenotype with a RES-dependent introns enrichment in genes with neurodevelopmental function. Altogether, our study unveils the fundamental role of RES complex during zebrafish embryogenesis and provides new insights into its molecular function in splicing.

"The Caenorhabditis elegans dauer larva is a facultative state of diapause. Mutations affecting dauer signal transduction and morphogenesis have been reported. Of these, most that result in constitutive formation of dauer larvae are temperature-sensitive (ts). The daf-31 mutant was isolated in genetic screens looking for novel and underrepresented classes of mutants that form dauer and dauer-like larvae non-conditionally. Dauer-like larvae are arrested in development and have some, but not all, of the normal dauer characteristics. We show here that daf-31 mutants form dauer-like larvae under starvation conditions but are sensitive to SDS treatment. Moreover, metabolism is shifted to fat accumulation in daf-31 mutants. We cloned the daf-31 gene and it encodes an ortholog of the arrest-defective-1 protein (ARD1) that is the catalytic subunit of the major N alpha-acetyltransferase (NatA). A daf-31 promoter::GFP reporter gene indicates daf-31 is expressed in multiple tissues including neurons, pharynx, intestine and hypodermal cells. Interestingly, overexpression of daf-31 enhances the longevity phenotype of daf-2 mutants, which is dependent on the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) DAF-16. We demonstrate that overexpression of daf-31 stimulates the transcriptional activity of DAF-16 without influencing its subcellular localization. These data reveal an essential role of NatA in controlling C. elegans life history and also a novel interaction between ARD1 and FOXO transcription factors, which may contribute to understanding the function of ARD1 in mammals.
","The development of a living organism is influenced by the environmental conditions such as nutrient availability. Under starvation conditions, the C. elegans larvae will enter a special developmental stage called dauer larva. An insulin-like signaling pathway controls dauer formation as well as adult lifespan by inhibiting the activity of FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 that regulates expression of stress-resistant genes. Here we isolate a new gene called daf-31; this gene encodes a protein that regulates C. elegans larval development, metabolism and adult lifespan. This protein has been found in other species to be part of an enzyme that functions to modify other proteins. We show that overexpression of our newly discovered protein stimulates the transcriptional activity of DAF-16. Interestingly, abnormal regulation of human proteins similar to DAF-31 results in tumor formation. It is known that human FOXO proteins prevent tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is possible that abnormal DAF-31 activity may lead to tumor growth by reducing DAF-16 activity. Thus, the present study may not only contribute to understanding the role of a universal enzyme in controlling development, metabolism and lifespan in other organisms besides worms but may also shed light on the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in humans.

"Snakebite envenomation is a neglected condition that constitutes a public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries, including Brazil. Interestingly, some animals are resistant to snake envenomation due to the presence of inhibitory glycoproteins in their serum that target toxic venom components. DM64 is an acidic glycoprotein isolated from Didelphis aurita (opossum) serum that has been characterized as an inhibitor of the myotoxicity induced by bothropic toxins bearing phospholipase A2 (PLA2) structures. This antitoxic protein can serve as an excellent starting template for the design of novel therapeutics against snakebite envenomation, particularly venom-induced local tissue damage. Therefore, the aim of this work was to produce a recombinant DM64 (rDM64) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and to compare its biological properties with those of native DM64. Yeast fermentation in the presence of Pefabloc, a serine protease inhibitor, stimulated cell growth (~1.5-fold), increased the rDM64 production yield approximately 10-fold and significantly reduced the susceptibility of rDM64 to proteolytic degradation. P. pastoris fermentation products were identified by mass spectrometry and Western blotting. The heterologous protein was efficiently purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography (with immobilized PLA2 myotoxin) and/or an ion exchange column. Although both native and recombinant DM64 exhibit different glycosylation patterns, they show very similar electrophoretic mobilities after PNGase F treatment. rDM64 formed a noncovalent complex with myotoxin II (Lys49-PLA2) from Bothrops asper and displayed biological activity that was similar to that of native DM64, inhibiting the cytotoxicity of myotoxin II by 92% at a 1:1 molar ratio.
","Snakebite envenomation causes medical emergencies that, depending on the species responsible for the bite, involve different organs and tissues. Envenomation by snakebite is a worldwide problem, and Brazil presents a high incidence of Bothrops bites. Bothrops venoms cause pathological alterations with prominent local effects, such as edema, blistering, hemorrhage, dermonecrosis and myonecrosis, usually followed by poor tissue regeneration and permanent sequelae. Bleeding, coagulopathy, cardiovascular shock and renal failure are typical systemic effects of these venoms. The clinical treatment for snakebite envenoming is intravenous administration of the specific antivenom. However, serotherapy does not efficiently protect against local tissue damage. Additional challenges faced by classical antivenom therapy include the wide antigenic variation of venoms across species and even within the same snake species and the frequent occurrence of adverse reactions that are associated with the administration of immunobiologicals. The development of new effective toxin inhibitors based on the structure of natural antiophidic proteins is an attractive therapeutic alternative. DM64 is a myotoxin inhibitor that was isolated from opossum serum, and its expression as a recombinant protein is paramount to the characterization of its structure-function relationship, an essential step toward the development of alternative strategies to better manage bothropic snakebite envenomations.

"Cellular signal transduction generally involves cascades of post-translational protein modifications that rapidly catalyze changes in protein-DNA interactions and gene expression. High-throughput measurements are improving our ability to study each of these stages individually, but do not capture the connections between them. Here we present an approach for building a network of physical links among these data that can be used to prioritize targets for pharmacological intervention. Our method recovers the critical missing links between proteomic and transcriptional data by relating changes in chromatin accessibility to changes in expression and then uses these links to connect proteomic and transcriptome data. We applied our approach to integrate epigenomic, phosphoproteomic and transcriptome changes induced by the variant III mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) in a cell line model of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). To test the relevance of the network, we used small molecules to target highly connected nodes implicated by the network model that were not detected by the experimental data in isolation and we found that a large fraction of these agents alter cell viability. Among these are two compounds, ICG-001, targeting CREB binding protein (CREBBP), and PKF118–310, targeting β-catenin (CTNNB1), which have not been tested previously for effectiveness against GBM. At the level of transcriptional regulation, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to experimentally determine the genome-wide binding locations of p300, a transcriptional co-regulator highly connected in the network. Analysis of p300 target genes suggested its role in tumorigenesis. We propose that this general method, in which experimental measurements are used as constraints for building regulatory networks from the interactome while taking into account noise and missing data, should be applicable to a wide range of high-throughput datasets.
","The ways in which cells respond to changes in their environment are controlled by networks of physical links among the proteins and genes. The initial signal of a change in conditions rapidly passes through these networks from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it can lead to long-term alterations in cellular behavior by controlling the expression of genes. These cascades of signaling events underlie many normal biological processes. As a result, being able to map out how these networks change in disease can provide critical insights for new approaches to treatment. We present a computational method for reconstructing these networks by finding links between the rapid short-term changes in proteins and the longer-term changes in gene regulation. This method brings together systematic measurements of protein signaling, genome organization and transcription in the context of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. When used to analyze datasets from an oncogene expressing cell line model of human glioblastoma, our approach identifies key nodes that affect cell survival and functional transcriptional regulators.

"The ability to assay genome-scale methylation patterns using high-throughput sequencing makes it possible to carry out association studies to determine the relationship between epigenetic variation and phenotype. While bisulfite sequencing can determine a methylome at high resolution, cost inhibits its use in comparative and population studies. MethylSeq, based on sequencing of fragment ends produced by a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, is a method for methyltyping (survey of methylation states) and is a site-specific and cost-effective alternative to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Despite its advantages, the use of MethylSeq has been restricted by biases in MethylSeq data that complicate the determination of methyltypes. Here we introduce a statistical method, MetMap, that produces corrected site-specific methylation states from MethylSeq experiments and annotates unmethylated islands across the genome. MetMap integrates genome sequence information with experimental data, in a statistically sound and cohesive Bayesian Network. It infers the extent of methylation at individual CGs and across regions, and serves as a framework for comparative methylation analysis within and among species. We validated MetMap's inferences with direct bisulfite sequencing, showing that the methylation status of sites and islands is accurately inferred. We used MetMap to analyze MethylSeq data from four human neutrophil samples, identifying novel, highly unmethylated islands that are invisible to sequence-based annotation strategies. The combination of MethylSeq and MetMap is a powerful and cost-effective tool for determining genome-scale methyltypes suitable for comparative and association studies.
","In the vertebrates, methylation of cytosine residues in DNA regulates gene activity in concert with proteins that associate with DNA. Large-scale genomewide comparative studies that seek to link specific methylation patterns to disease will require hundreds or thousands of samples, and thus economical methods that assay genomewide methylation. One such method is MethylSeq, which samples cytosine methylation at site-specific resolution by high-throughput sequencing of the ends of DNA fragments generated by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. MethylSeq's low cost and simplicity of implementation enable its use in large-scale comparative studies, but biases inherent to the method inhibit interpretation of the data it produces. Here we present MetMap, a statistical framework that first accounts for the biases in MethylSeq data and then generates an analysis of the data that is suitable for use in comparative studies. We show that MethylSeq and MetMap can be used together to determine methylation profiles across the genome, and to identify novel unmethylated regions that are likely to be involved in gene regulation. The ability to conduct comparative studies of sufficient scale at a reasonable cost promises to reveal new insights into the relationship between cytosine methylation and phenotype.

"Dynamic models of large-scale brain activity have been used for reproducing many empirical findings on human brain functional connectivity. Features that have been shown to be reproducible by comparing modeled to empirical data include functional connectivity measured over several minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, as well as its time-resolved fluctuations on a time scale of tens of seconds. However, comparison of modeled and empirical data has not been conducted yet for fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity, such as fluctuations between segregated and integrated topology or between high and low modularity topology. Since these global network-level fluctuations have been shown to be related to human cognition and behavior, there is an emerging need for clarifying their reproducibility with computational models. To address this problem, we directly compared fluctuations in global network topology of functional connectivity between modeled and empirical data, and clarified the degree to which a stationary model of spontaneous brain dynamics can reproduce the empirically observed fluctuations. Modeled fluctuations were simulated using a system of coupled phase oscillators wired according to brain structural connectivity. By performing model parameter search, we found that modeled fluctuations in global metrics quantifying network integration and modularity had more than 80% of magnitudes of those observed in the empirical data. Temporal properties of network states determined based on fluctuations in these metrics were also found to be reproducible, although their spatial patterns in functional connectivity did not perfectly matched. These results suggest that stationary models simulating resting-state activity can reproduce the magnitude of empirical fluctuations in segregation and integration, whereas additional factors, such as active mechanisms controlling non-stationary dynamics and/or greater accuracy of mapping brain structural connectivity, would be necessary for fully reproducing the spatial patterning associated with these fluctuations.
","In human neuroscience, there is growing interest in temporal fluctuations in coactivation patterns of resting-state brain activity. To elucidate generative mechanisms of these fluctuations, theoretical studies try to reproduce their empirical properties by simulations using dynamic models of large-scale spontaneous brain activity. However, evaluations of the reproducibility have not been extended so far to the fluctuations in global network topology of coactivation patterns, recently shown to be related to human cognition and behavior. Here we examine the extent to which a stationary model typically used for simulating resting-state activity can reproduce spatial and temporal patterns of the empirically observed fluctuations in global network topology. We found that such a model successfully reproduced the magnitude of empirical fluctuations as well as their temporal dynamics, whereas their spatial patterning was not fully accounted for by the simulation. Our results suggest that stationary models can explain many empirical properties in the fluctuations in global network topology, while modeling of non-stationary dynamics and/or greater estimation accuracy of anatomical connections underlying the simulation would be required for complete replication. This finding provides new insights into how fluctuations in global network topology of coactivation patterns emerge in the human brain.

"TDP-43 is a multifunctional nucleic acid binding protein linked to several neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia. To learn more about the normal biological and abnormal pathological role of this protein, we turned to Caenorhabditis elegans and its orthologue TDP-1. We report that TDP-1 functions in the Insulin/IGF pathway to regulate longevity and the oxidative stress response downstream from the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO3a. However, although tdp-1 mutants are stress-sensitive, chronic upregulation of tdp-1 expression is toxic and decreases lifespan. ALS–associated mutations in TDP-43 or the related RNA binding protein FUS activate the unfolded protein response and generate oxidative stress leading to the daf-16–dependent upregulation of tdp-1 expression with negative effects on neuronal function and lifespan. Consistently, deletion of endogenous tdp-1 rescues mutant TDP-43 and FUS proteotoxicity in C. elegans. These results suggest that chronic induction of wild-type TDP-1/TDP-43 by cellular stress may propagate neurodegeneration and decrease lifespan.
","TAR DNA Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) is implicated in several human age-dependent neurodegenerative disorders, but until now little was known about TDP-43's role in the aging process. Here we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study the role of the TDP-43 orthologue tdp-1 in aging and neurodegeneration. In this study we discovered that tdp-1 is a stress-responsive gene acting within the Insulin/IGF signaling pathway to regulate lifespan and the response to oxidative stress. We found that, although worms missing tdp-1 were stress-sensitive, elevated expression of tdp-1 was toxic. We asked if tdp-1 also responded to the stress caused by toxic proteins found in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Using worm models for ALS, we discovered that mutant TDP-43 generated oxidative stress and induced tdp-1 expression with negative consequences on neuronal function and lifespan. Consistently, removing tdp-1 rescued toxicity in our worm ALS models. tdp-1's role in the cellular stress response likely reflects an ancient adaptation to deal with unfavorable environmental conditions that is inappropriately activated and maintained by genetic mutations leading to proteotoxic and oxidative stress. We predict that similar mechanisms may exist in humans, helping explain the involvement of TDP-43 in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders.

"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the United States is projected to double or triple by 2050. We reasoned that the genes that modulate insulin production might be new targets for diabetes therapeutics. Therefore, we developed an siRNA screening system to identify genes important for the activity of the insulin promoter in beta cells. We created a subclone of the MIN6 mouse pancreatic beta cell line that expresses destabilized GFP under the control of a 362 base pair fragment of the human insulin promoter and the mCherry red fluorescent protein under the control of the constitutively active rous sarcoma virus promoter. The ratio of the GFP to mCherry fluorescence of a cell indicates its insulin promoter activity. As G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have emerged as novel targets for diabetes therapies, we used this cell line to screen an siRNA library targeting all known mouse GPCRs. We identified several known GPCR regulators of insulin secretion as regulators of the insulin promoter. One of the top positive regulators was Gpr27, an orphan GPCR with no known role in beta cell function. We show that knockdown of Gpr27 reduces endogenous mouse insulin promoter activity and glucose stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, we show that Pdx1 is important for Gpr27's effect on the insulin promoter and insulin secretion. Finally, the over-expression of Gpr27 in 293T cells increases inositol phosphate levels, while knockdown of Gpr27 in MIN6 cells reduces inositol phosphate levels, suggesting this orphan GPCR might couple to Gq/11. In summary, we demonstrate a MIN6-based siRNA screening system that allows rapid identification of novel positive and negative regulators of the insulin promoter. Using this system, we identify Gpr27 as a positive regulator of insulin production.
","Pancreatic beta cells are the only physiologic source of insulin. When these cells are destroyed in type 1 diabetics, there is uncontrolled hyperglycemia from complete insulin deficiency. In type 2 diabetes, these same cells fail to increase insulin secretion to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance leading to relative insulin deficiency. We constructed a novel screening system to find new regulators of insulin production in this critical cell type. Here, we describe a screen of the G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and show a role for orphan GPCR, Gpr27, in insulin promoter activity and insulin secretion. We propose that Gpr27 is a novel target for diabetes therapeutics.

"Ageing populations pose one of the main public health crises of our time. Reprogramming gene expression by altering the activities of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) can ameliorate deleterious effects of age. Here we explore how a circuit of TFs coordinates pro-longevity transcriptional outcomes, which reveals a multi-tissue and multi-species role for an entire protein family: the E-twenty-six (ETS) TFs. In Drosophila, reduced insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) extends lifespan by coordinating activation of Aop, an ETS transcriptional repressor, and Foxo, a Forkhead transcriptional activator. Aop and Foxo bind the same genomic loci, and we show that, individually, they effect similar transcriptional programmes in vivo. In combination, Aop can both moderate or synergise with Foxo, dependent on promoter context. Moreover, Foxo and Aop oppose the gene-regulatory activity of Pnt, an ETS transcriptional activator. Directly knocking down Pnt recapitulates aspects of the Aop/Foxo transcriptional programme and is sufficient to extend lifespan. The lifespan-limiting role of Pnt appears to be balanced by a requirement for metabolic regulation in young flies, in which the Aop-Pnt-Foxo circuit determines expression of metabolic genes, and Pnt regulates lipolysis and responses to nutrient stress. Molecular functions are often conserved amongst ETS TFs, prompting us to examine whether other Drosophila ETS-coding genes may also affect ageing. We show that five out of eight Drosophila ETS TFs play a role in fly ageing, acting from a range of organs and cells including the intestine, adipose and neurons. We expand the repertoire of lifespan-limiting ETS TFs in C. elegans, confirming their conserved function in ageing and revealing that the roles of ETS TFs in physiology and lifespan are conserved throughout the family, both within and between species.
","Understanding the basic biology of ageing may help us to reduce the burden of ill-health that old age brings. Ageing is modulated by changes to gene expression, which are orchestrated by the coordinate activity of proteins called transcription factors (TFs). E-twenty six (ETS) TFs are a large family with cellular functions that are conserved across animal taxa. In this study, we examine a longevity-promoting transcriptional circuit composed of two ETS TFs, Pnt and Aop, and Foxo, a forkhead TF with evolutionarily-conserved pro-longevity functions. This leads us to demonstrate that the activity of the majority of ETS TFs in multiple tissues and even different animal taxa regulates lifespan, indicating that roles in ageing are a general feature of this family of transcriptional regulators.

"Dual colour total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool for decoding the molecular dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Typically, the recruitment of a fluorescent protein–tagged endocytic protein was referenced to the disappearance of spot-like clathrin-coated structure (CCS), but the precision of spot-like CCS disappearance as a marker for canonical CME remained unknown. Here we have used an imaging assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to detect scission events with a resolution of ∼2 s. We found that scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor cargo at CCSs of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear following scission. We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of endocytic protein to scission events: Abp1, ACK1, amphiphysin1, APPL1, Arp3, BIN1, CALM, CIP4, clathrin light chain (Clc), cofilin, coronin1B, cortactin, dynamin1/2, endophilin2, Eps15, Eps8, epsin2, FBP17, FCHo1/2, GAK, Hip1R, lifeAct, mu2 subunit of the AP2 complex, myosin1E, myosin6, NECAP, N-WASP, OCRL1, Rab5, SNX9, synaptojanin2β1, and syndapin2. For each protein we aligned ∼1,000 recruitment profiles to their respective scission events and constructed characteristic “recruitment signatures” that were grouped, as for yeast, to reveal the modular organization of mammalian CME. A detailed analysis revealed the unanticipated recruitment dynamics of SNX9, FBP17, and CIP4 and showed that the same set of proteins was recruited, in the same order, to scission events at CCSs of different sizes and lifetimes. Collectively these data reveal the fine-grained temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of mammalian CME in which the same core mechanism of CME, involving actin, operates at CCSs of diverse sizes and lifetimes.
","The molecular machinery of clathrin-mediated endocytosis concentrates receptors at the cell surface in a patch of membrane that curves into a vesicle, pinches off, and internalizes membrane cargo and a tiny volume of extracellular fluid. We know that dozens of proteins are involved in this process, but precisely when and where they act remains poorly understood. Here we used a fluorescence imaging assay to detect the moment of scission in living cells and used this as a reference point from which to measure the characteristic recruitment signatures of 34 fluorescently tagged endocytic proteins. Pair-wise comparison of these recruitment signatures allowed us to identify seven modules of proteins that were recruited with similar kinetics. For the most part the recruitment signatures were consistent with what was previously known about the proteins' structure and their binding affinities; however, the recruitment signatures for some components (such as some BAR and F-BAR domain proteins) could not have been predicted from existing structural or biochemical data. This study provides a paradigm for mapping molecular dynamics in living cells and provides new insights into the mechanism of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

"For gene products that must be present in cells at defined concentrations, expression levels must be tightly controlled to ensure robustness against environmental, genetic, and developmental noise. By studying the regulation of the concentration-sensitive Drosophila melanogaster Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), we found that Ubx enhancer activities respond to both increases in Ubx levels and genetic background. Large, transient increases in Ubx levels are capable of silencing all enhancer input into Ubx transcription, resulting in the complete silencing of this gene. Small increases in Ubx levels, brought about by duplications of the Ubx locus, cause sporadic silencing of subsets of Ubx enhancers. Ubx enhancer silencing can also be induced by outcrossing laboratory stocks to D. melanogaster strains established from wild flies from around the world. These results suggest that enhancer activities are not rigidly determined, but instead are sensitive to genetic background. Together, these findings suggest that enhancer silencing may be used to maintain gene product levels within the correct range in response to natural genetic variation.
","Gene expression is generally governed by cis-regulatory elements, also called enhancers. For genes whose expression levels must be tightly controlled, enhancer activities must be tightly regulated. In this work, we show that enhancers that control the expression of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in Drosophila are regulated by a negative autoregulatory feedback mechanism. Negative autoregulation can be triggered by less than a two-fold increase in Ubx levels or by varying the genetic background. Together, these data reveal that enhancer activities are not always hardwired, but instead may be sensitive to genetic and environmental variation and, in some cases, to the amount of gene product they regulate. The finding that enhancers are sensitive to genetic background suggests that the regulation of gene expression is more plastic than previously thought and has important implications for how transcription is controlled in vivo.

"There is no effective vaccine against Buruli ulcer. In experimental footpad infection of C57BL/6 mice with M. ulcerans, a prime-boost vaccination protocol using plasmid DNA encoding mycolyltransferase Ag85A of M. ulcerans and a homologous protein boost has shown significant, albeit transient protection, comparable to the one induced by M. bovis BCG. The mycolactone toxin is an obvious candidate for a vaccine, but by virtue of its chemical structure, this toxin is not immunogenic in itself. However, antibodies against some of the polyketide synthase domains involved in mycolactone synthesis, were found in Buruli ulcer patients and healthy controls from the same endemic region, suggesting that these domains are indeed immunogenic. Here we have analyzed the vaccine potential of nine polyketide synthase domains using a DNA prime/protein boost strategy. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated against the following domains: acyl carrier protein 1, 2, and 3, acyltransferase (acetate) 1 and 2, acyltransferase (propionate), enoylreductase, ketoreductase A, and ketosynthase load module. As positive controls, mice were vaccinated with DNA encoding Ag85A or with M. bovis BCG. Strongest antigen specific antibodies could be detected in response to acyltransferase (propionate) and enoylreductase. Antigen-specific Th1 type cytokine responses (IL-2 or IFN-γ) were induced by vaccination against all antigens, and were strongest against acyltransferase (propionate). Finally, vaccination against acyltransferase (propionate) and enoylreductase conferred some protection against challenge with virulent M. ulcerans 1615. However, protection was weaker than the one conferred by vaccination with Ag85A or M. bovis BCG. Combinations of these polyketide synthase domains with the vaccine targeting Ag85A, of which the latter is involved in the integrity of the cell wall of the pathogen, and/or with live attenuated M. bovis BCG or mycolactone negative M. ulcerans may eventually lead to the development of an efficacious BU vaccine.
","Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease, characterized by deep, ulcerating skin lesions, particularly on arms and legs, which are provoked by a toxin. BU is caused by a microbe of the genus that also cause tuberculosis and leprosy. The 33 countries where Buruli ulcer has been detected, especially in West Africa, have mainly tropical and subtropical climates, although the disease is also present in temperate areas of Australia and Japan. There is no effective vaccine against BU and it is still not fully understood which immune defence mechanisms (antibodies and/or T cells) are needed to control the infection. The identification of microbial components that are involved in immune control is an essential step in the development of an effective vaccine. In this paper, we used an experimental mouse model to demonstrate the immunogenicity and the vaccine potential of enzymes involved in the toxin synthesis. Combinations with other vaccine candidates, such as a subunit vaccine against Ag85A targeting cell wall synthesis or with live, attenuated M. bovis BCG or mycolactone negative Mycobacterium ulcerans remain to be tested.

"Sex-specific traits that lead to the production of dimorphic gametes, sperm in males and eggs in females, are fundamental for sexual reproduction and accordingly widespread among animals. Yet the sex-biased genes that underlie these sex-specific traits are under strong selective pressure, and as a result of adaptive evolution they often become divergent. Indeed out of hundreds of male or female fertility genes identified in diverse organisms, only a very small number of them are implicated specifically in reproduction in more than one lineage. Few genes have exhibited a sex-biased, reproductive-specific requirement beyond a given phylum, raising the question of whether any sex-specific gametogenesis factors could be conserved and whether gametogenesis might have evolved multiple times. Here we describe a metazoan origin of a conserved human reproductive protein, BOULE, and its prevalence from primitive basal metazoans to chordates. We found that BOULE homologs are present in the genomes of representative species of each of the major lineages of metazoans and exhibit reproductive-specific expression in all species examined, with a preponderance of male-biased expression. Examination of Boule evolution within insect and mammalian lineages revealed little evidence for accelerated evolution, unlike most reproductive genes. Instead, purifying selection was the major force behind Boule evolution. Furthermore, loss of function of mammalian Boule resulted in male-specific infertility and a global arrest of sperm development remarkably similar to the phenotype in an insect boule mutation. This work demonstrates the conservation of a reproductive protein throughout eumetazoa, its predominant testis-biased expression in diverse bilaterian species, and conservation of a male gametogenic requirement in mice. This shows an ancient gametogenesis requirement for Boule among Bilateria and supports a model of a common origin of spermatogenesis.
","While sexual reproduction is widespread among animals, it remains enigmatic to what extent sexual reproduction is conserved and when sex-specific gametogenesis (spermatogenesis and oogenesis) originated in animals. Here we demonstrate the presence of the reproductive-specific protein Boule throughout bilaterally-symmetric animals (Bilateria) and the conservation of its male reproductive function in mice. Examination of Boule evolution in insect and mammalian lineages, representing the Protostome and Deuterostome clades of bilateral animals, failed to detect any evidence for accelerated evolution. Instead, purifying selection is the major force behind Boule evolution. Further investigation of Boule homologs among Deuterostome species revealed reproduction-specific expression, with a strong prevalence of testis-biased expression. We further determined the function of a deuterostomian Boule homolog by inactivating Boule in mice (a representative mammal, a class of Deuterostomes). Like its counterpart in Drosophila (a representative of the opposing Protostome clade), mouse Boule is also required only for male reproduction. Loss of mouse Boule prevents sperm production, resulting in a global arrest of spermatogenesis in remarkable similarity to that of Drosophila boule mutants. Our findings are consistent with a common origin for male gametogenesis among metazoans and reveal the high conservation of a reproduction-specific protein among bilaterian animals.

"Myotubularin is a lipid phosphatase implicated in endosomal trafficking in vitro, but with an unknown function in vivo. Mutations in myotubularin cause myotubular myopathy, a devastating congenital myopathy with unclear pathogenesis and no current therapies. Myotubular myopathy was the first described of a growing list of conditions caused by mutations in proteins implicated in membrane trafficking. To advance the understanding of myotubularin function and disease pathogenesis, we have created a zebrafish model of myotubular myopathy using morpholino antisense technology. Zebrafish with reduced levels of myotubularin have significantly impaired motor function and obvious histopathologic changes in their muscle. These changes include abnormally shaped and positioned nuclei and myofiber hypotrophy. These findings are consistent with those observed in the human disease. We demonstrate for the first time that myotubularin functions to regulate PI3P levels in a vertebrate in vivo, and that homologous myotubularin-related proteins can functionally compensate for the loss of myotubularin. Finally, we identify abnormalities in the tubulo-reticular network in muscle from myotubularin zebrafish morphants and correlate these changes with abnormalities in T-tubule organization in biopsies from patients with myotubular myopathy. In all, we have generated a new model of myotubular myopathy and employed this model to uncover a novel function for myotubularin and a new pathomechanism for the human disease that may explain the weakness associated with the condition (defective excitation–contraction coupling). In addition, our findings of tubuloreticular abnormalities and defective excitation-contraction coupling mechanistically link myotubular myopathy with several other inherited muscle diseases, most notably those due to ryanodine receptor mutations. Based on our findings, we speculate that congenital myopathies, usually considered entities with similar clinical features but very disparate pathomechanisms, may at their root be disorders of calcium homeostasis.
","Congenital myopathies are inherited muscle conditions typically presenting in early childhood. They are individually rare, but as a group are likely as common as conditions such as muscular dystrophy. The zebrafish is an emerging experimental system for the study of myopathies. We have utilized the zebrafish to develop a model of myotubular myopathy, one of the most severe childhood muscle diseases and a condition whose pathogenesis is poorly understood. We have generated fish that have the characteristic behavioral and histological features of human myotubular myopathy. Using this model, we then made novel insights into the pathogenesis of myotubular myopathy, including the identification of abnormalities in the muscle tubulo-reticular system. We subsequently identified similar changes in muscle from patients with myotubular myopathy, corroborating the importance of our zebrafish findings. Because a functional tubulo-reticular complex is required for normal muscle contraction, we speculate that the weakness observed in myotubular myopathy is caused by breakdown of this network. In all, our study is the first to identify a potential pathomechanism to explain the clinical features of myotubular myopathy. Furthermore, by revealing abnormalities in the tubulo-reticular system, we provide a novel link between myotubular myopathy and several other congenital myopathies.

"Translation control often operates via remodeling of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles. The poly(A) binding protein (PABP) simultaneously interacts with the 3′ poly(A) tail of the mRNA and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) to stimulate translation. PABP also promotes miRNA-dependent deadenylation and translational repression of target mRNAs. We demonstrate that isoform 2 of the mouse heterogeneous nuclear protein Q (hnRNP-Q2/SYNCRIP) binds poly(A) by default when PABP binding is inhibited. In addition, hnRNP-Q2 competes with PABP for binding to poly(A) in vitro. Depleting hnRNP-Q2 from translation extracts stimulates cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation that is dependent on the PABP/poly(A) complex. Adding recombinant hnRNP-Q2 to the extracts inhibited translation in a poly(A) tail-dependent manner. The displacement of PABP from the poly(A) tail by hnRNP-Q2 impaired the association of eIF4E with the 5′ m7G cap structure of mRNA, resulting in the inhibition of 48S and 80S ribosome initiation complex formation. In mouse fibroblasts, silencing of hnRNP-Q2 stimulated translation. In addition, hnRNP-Q2 impeded let-7a miRNA-mediated deadenylation and repression of target mRNAs, which require PABP. Thus, by competing with PABP, hnRNP-Q2 plays important roles in the regulation of global translation and miRNA-mediated repression of specific mRNAs.
","The regulation of mRNA translation and stability is of paramount importance for almost every cellular function. In eukaryotes, the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) is a central regulator of both global and mRNA-specific translation. PABP simultaneously interacts with the 3′ poly(A) tail of the mRNA and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G). These interactions circularize the mRNA and stimulate translation. PABP also regulates specific mRNAs by promoting miRNA-dependent deadenylation and translational repression. A key step in understanding PABP's functions is to identify factors that affect its association with the poly(A) tail. Here we show that the cytoplasmic isoform of the mouse heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (hnRNP-Q2/SYNCRIP), which exhibits binding preference to poly(A), interacts with the poly(A) tail by default when PABP binding is inhibited. In addition, hnRNP-Q2 competes with PABP for binding to the poly(A) tail. Depleting hnRNP-Q2 stimulates translation in cell-free extracts and in cultured cells, in agreement with its function as translational repressor. In addition, hnRNP-Q2 impeded miRNA-mediated deadenylation and repression of target mRNAs, which requires PABP. Thus, competition from hnRNP-Q2 provides a novel mechanism by which multiple functions of PABP are regulated. This regulation could play important roles in various biological processes, such as development, viral infection, and human disease.

"The goal of influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is to determine the timing, location and magnitude of outbreaks by monitoring the frequency and progression of clinical case incidence. Advances in computational and information technology have allowed for automated collection of higher volumes of electronic data and more timely analyses than previously possible. Novel surveillance systems, including those based on internet search query data like Google Flu Trends (GFT), are being used as surrogates for clinically-based reporting of influenza-like-illness (ILI). We investigated the reliability of GFT during the last decade (2003 to 2013), and compared weekly public health surveillance with search query data to characterize the timing and intensity of seasonal and pandemic influenza at the national (United States), regional (Mid-Atlantic) and local (New York City) levels. We identified substantial flaws in the original and updated GFT models at all three geographic scales, including completely missing the first wave of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic, and greatly overestimating the intensity of the A/H3N2 epidemic during the 2012/2013 season. These results were obtained for both the original (2008) and the updated (2009) GFT algorithms. The performance of both models was problematic, perhaps because of changes in internet search behavior and differences in the seasonality, geographical heterogeneity and age-distribution of the epidemics between the periods of GFT model-fitting and prospective use. We conclude that GFT data may not provide reliable surveillance for seasonal or pandemic influenza and should be interpreted with caution until the algorithm can be improved and evaluated. Current internet search query data are no substitute for timely local clinical and laboratory surveillance, or national surveillance based on local data collection. New generation surveillance systems such as GFT should incorporate the use of near-real time electronic health data and computational methods for continued model-fitting and ongoing evaluation and improvement.
","In November 2008, Google Flu Trends was launched as an open tool for influenza surveillance in the United States. Engineered as a system for early detection and daily monitoring of the intensity of seasonal influenza epidemics, Google Flu Trends uses internet search data and a proprietary algorithm to provide a surrogate measure of influenza-like illness in the population. During its first season of operation, the novel A/H1N1-pdm influenza virus emerged, heterogeneously causing sporadic outbreaks in the spring and summer of 2009 across many parts of the United States. During the autumn 2009 pandemic wave, Google updated their model with a new algorithm and case definition; the updated model has run prospectively since. Our study asks whether Google Flu Trends provides accurate detection and monitoring of influenza at the national, regional and local geographic scales. Reliable local surveillance is important to reduce uncertainty and improve situational awareness during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. We found substantial flaws with the original and updated Google Flu Trends models, including missing the emergence of the 2009 pandemic and overestimating the 2012/2013 influenza season epidemic. Our work supports the development of local near-real time computerized syndromic surveillance systems, and collaborative regional, national and international networks.

"Frataxin (Yfh1 in yeast) is a conserved protein and deficiency leads to the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich’s ataxia. Frataxin is a critical protein for Fe-S cluster assembly in mitochondria, interacting with other components of the Fe-S cluster machinery, including cysteine desulfurase Nfs1, Isd11 and the Isu1 scaffold protein. Yeast Isu1 with the methionine to isoleucine substitution (M141I), in which the E. coli amino acid is inserted at this position, corrected most of the phenotypes that result from lack of Yfh1 in yeast. This suppressor Isu1 behaved as a genetic dominant. Furthermore frataxin-bypass activity required a completely functional Nfs1 and correlated with the presence of efficient scaffold function. A screen of random Isu1 mutations for frataxin-bypass activity identified only M141 substitutions, including Ile, Cys, Leu, or Val. In each case, mitochondrial Nfs1 persulfide formation was enhanced, and mitochondrial Fe-S cluster assembly was improved in the absence of frataxin. Direct targeting of the entire E. coli IscU to ∆yfh1 mitochondria also ameliorated the mutant phenotypes. In contrast, expression of IscU with the reverse substitution i.e. IscU with Ile to Met change led to worsening of the ∆yfh1 phenotypes, including severely compromised growth, increased sensitivity to oxygen, deficiency in Fe-S clusters and heme, and impaired iron homeostasis. A bioinformatic survey of eukaryotic Isu1/prokaryotic IscU database entries sorted on the amino acid utilized at the M141 position identified unique groupings, with virtually all of the eukaryotic scaffolds using Met, and the preponderance of prokaryotic scaffolds using other amino acids. The frataxin-bypassing amino acids Cys, Ile, Leu, or Val, were found predominantly in prokaryotes. This amino acid position 141 is unique in Isu1, and the frataxin-bypass effect likely mimics a conserved and ancient feature of the prokaryotic Fe-S cluster assembly machinery.
","Frataxin was discovered because mutations in the corresponding gene cause the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich’s ataxia. The finding that frataxin protein physically associates with scaffold proteins Isu1/IscU places it squarely in the pathway of Fe-S cluster assembly. Fe-S clusters are essential cofactors for many proteins involved in cellular respiration, DNA repair, translation and other processes. Frataxin is conserved throughout evolution, being present in eukaryotes such as yeast and human and in some prokaryotes including E. coli. However, differences exist between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic forms of frataxin. The eukaryotic forms are critical for Fe-S cluster assembly whereas prokaryotic forms are more dispensable. We found that a key to this difference is a single amino acid in the scaffold protein Isu1 at position 141. Changes of the eukaryotic amino acid, Met, to prokaryotic amino acids, Ile, Leu, Cys, or Val, rendered mitochondria more frataxin-independent. No other changes were able to replicate this effect. Thus, Isu1 containing Met at position 141 may have coevolved with frataxin in eukaryotes, conferring frataxin-dependence. In contrast, the appearance of other amino acids at this position may have rendered prokaryotic cells less dependent on frataxin.

"How muscles are used is a key to understanding the internal driving of fish swimming. However, the underlying mechanisms of some features of the muscle activation patterns and their differential appearance in different species are still obscure. In this study, we explain the muscle activation patterns by using 3D computational fluid dynamics models coupled to the motion of fish with prescribed deformation and examining the torque and power required along the fish body with two primary swimming modes. We find that the torque required by the hydrodynamic forces and body inertia exhibits a wave pattern that travels faster than the curvature wave in both anguilliform and carangiform swimmers, which can explain the traveling wave speeds of the muscle activations. Notably, intermittent negative power (i.e., power delivered by the fluid to the body) on the posterior part, along with a timely transfer of torque and energy by tendons, explains the decrease in the duration of muscle activation towards the tail. The torque contribution from the body elasticity further clarifies the wave speed increase or the reverse of the wave direction of the muscle activation on the posterior part of a carangiform swimmer. For anguilliform swimmers, the absence of the aforementioned changes in the muscle activation on the posterior part is consistent with our torque prediction and the absence of long tendons from experimental observations. These results provide novel insights into the functions of muscles and tendons as an integral part of the internal driving system, especially from an energy perspective, and they highlight the differences in the internal driving systems between the two primary swimming modes.
","For undulatory swimming, fish form posteriorly traveling waves of body bending by activating their muscles sequentially along the body. However, experimental observations have shown that the muscle activation wave does not simply match the bending wave. Researchers have previously computed the torque required for muscles along the body based on classic hydrodynamic theories and explained the higher wave speed of the muscle activation compared to the curvature wave. However, the origins of other features of the muscle activation pattern and their variation among different species are still obscure after decades of research. In this study, we use 3D computational fluid dynamics models to compute the spatiotemporal distributions of both the torque and power required for eel-like and mackerel-like swimming. By examining both the torque and power patterns and considering the energy transfer, storage, and release by tendons and body viscoelasticity, we can explain not only the features and variations in the muscle activation patterns as observed from fish experiments but also how tendons and body elasticity save energy. We provide a mechanical picture in which the body shape, body movement, muscles, tendons, and body elasticity of a mackerel (or similar) orchestrate to make swimming efficient.

"It has been recently reported that a side population of cells in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) displayed characteristics of stem-like cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of such stem-like cell populations in NPC remain unclear. Epstein-Barr virus was the first identified human tumor virus to be associated with various malignancies, most notably NPC. LMP2A, the Epstein-Barr virus encoded latent protein, has been reported to play roles in oncogenic processes. We report by immunostaining in our current study that LMP2A is overexpressed in 57.6% of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumors sampled and is mainly localized at the tumor invasive front. We found also in NPC cells that the exogenous expression of LMP2A greatly increases their invasive/migratory ability, induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like cellular marker alterations, and stimulates stem cell side populations and the expression of stem cell markers. In addition, LMP2A enhances the transforming ability of cancer cells in both colony formation and soft agar assays, as well as the self-renewal ability of stem-like cancer cells in a spherical culture assay. Additionally, LMP2A increases the number of cancer initiating cells in a xenograft tumor formation assay. More importantly, the endogenous expression of LMP2A positively correlates with the expression of ABCG2 in NPC samples. Finally, we demonstrate that Akt inhibitor (V) greatly decreases the size of the stem cell side populations in LMP2A-expressing cells. Taken together, our data indicate that LMP2A induces EMT and stem-like cell self-renewal in NPC, suggesting a novel mechanism by which Epstein-Barr virus induces the initiation, metastasis and recurrence of NPC.
","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects about 90% of people worldwide and persists benignly as a latent infection. However, EBV is associated with different types of human cancer. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most commonly known EBV associated cancer and expresses a well defined set of latent viral genes, including LMP2A, which has been detected in the majority of NPC samples. Several studies indicated this latent viral protein drove cellular invasion and metastasis. For this study, enforced LMP2A expressing NPC cell lines were generated. We show here that LMP2A induces an Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition and increases the Stem-like Cancer Cells in NPC. Our results suggest that LMP2A supports tumor initiation and recurrence of the infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. For the first time we report a virus protein that functions in the initiation and progression of cancer by inducing the cancer stem-like cells. These findings permit a more detailed understanding of function and contribution to viral pathogenesis and provide a novel therapeutic target for NPC therapy.

"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a genetically tractable animal host in which to study evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of innate immune signaling. We previously showed that the PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates innate immunity of C. elegans through phosphorylation of the CREB/ATF bZIP transcription factor, ATF-7. Here, we have undertaken a genomic analysis of the transcriptional response of C. elegans to infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, combining genome-wide expression analysis by RNA-seq with ATF-7 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We observe that PMK-1-ATF-7 activity regulates a majority of all genes induced by pathogen infection, and observe ATF-7 occupancy in regulatory regions of pathogen-induced genes in a PMK-1-dependent manner. Moreover, functional analysis of a subset of these ATF-7-regulated pathogen-induced target genes supports a direct role for this transcriptional response in host defense. The genome-wide regulation through PMK-1– ATF-7 signaling reveals a striking level of control over the innate immune response to infection through a single transcriptional regulator.
","Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading microbes across metazoans. Caenorhabditis elegans lacks adaptive immunity and is therefore particularly dependent on mounting an innate immune response against pathogens. A major component of this response is the conserved PMK-1/p38 MAPK signaling cascade, the activation of which results in phosphorylation of the bZIP transcription factor ATF-7. Signaling via PMK-1 and ATF-7 causes broad transcriptional changes including the induction of many genes that are predicted to have antimicrobial activity including C-type lectins and lysozymes. In this study, we show that ATF-7 directly regulates the majority of innate immune response genes upon pathogen infection of C. elegans, and demonstrate that many ATF-7 targets function to promote pathogen resistance.

"SMYD4 belongs to a family of lysine methyltransferases. We analyzed the role of smyd4 in zebrafish development by generating a smyd4 mutant zebrafish line (smyd4L544Efs*1) using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The maternal and zygotic smyd4L544Efs*1 mutants demonstrated severe cardiac malformations, including defects in left-right patterning and looping and hypoplastic ventricles, suggesting that smyd4 was critical for heart development. Importantly, we identified two rare SMYD4 genetic variants in a 208-patient cohort with congenital heart defects. Both biochemical and functional analyses indicated that SMYD4(G345D) was pathogenic. Our data suggested that smyd4 functions as a histone methyltransferase and, by interacting with HDAC1, also serves as a potential modulator for histone acetylation. Transcriptome and bioinformatics analyses of smyd4L544Efs*1 and wild-type developing hearts suggested that smyd4 is a key epigenetic regulator involved in regulating endoplasmic reticulum-mediated protein processing and several important metabolic pathways in developing zebrafish hearts.
","SMYD4 belongs to a SET and MYND domain-containing lysine methyltransferase. In zebrafish, smyd4 is ubiquitously expressed in early embryos and becomes enriched in the developing heart at 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf). We generated a smyd4 mutant zebrafish line (smyd4L544Efs*1) using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The maternal and zygotic smyd4L544Efs*1 mutants demonstrated a strong defect in cardiomyocyte proliferation, which led to a severe cardiac malformation, including left-right looping defects and hypoplastic ventricles. More importantly, two rare genetic variants of SMYD4 were enriched in a 208-patient cohort with congenital heart defects. Both biochemical and functional analyses indicated that SMYD4(G345D) was highly pathogenic. Using mass spectrometric analysis, SMYD4 was shown to specifically interact with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) via its MYND domain. Altered di- and tri-methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acetylation of histone 3 in smyd4L544Efs*1 mutants suggested that smyd4 plays an important role in epigenetic regulation. Transcriptome and pathway analyses demonstrated that the expression levels of 3,856 genes were significantly altered, which included cardiac contractile genes, key signaling pathways in cardiac development, the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated protein processing pathway, and several important metabolic pathways. Taken together, our data suggests that smyd4 is a key epigenetic regulator of cardiac development.

"The human pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei possess both de novo and salvage routes for the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Consequently, they do not require salvageable pyrimidines for growth. Thymidine kinase (TK) catalyzes the formation of dTMP and dUMP and is one of several salvage enzymes that appear redundant to the de novo pathway. Surprisingly, we show through analysis of TK conditional null and RNAi cells that TK is essential for growth and for infectivity in a mouse model, and that a catalytically active enzyme is required for its function. Unlike humans, T. brucei and all other kinetoplastids lack dCMP deaminase (DCTD), which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DCTD resulted in full rescue of the RNAi growth phenotype and allowed for selection of viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling by LC-MS/MS revealed a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides in TK depleted cells. Knockout of cytidine deaminase (CDA), which converts deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine led to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy. These unexpected results suggested that T. brucei encodes an unidentified 5'-nucleotidase that converts deoxypyrimidine nucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides, leading to their dead-end buildup in TK depleted cells at the expense of dTTP pools. Bioinformatics analysis identified several potential candidate genes that could encode 5’-nucleotidase activity including an HD-domain protein that we show catalyzes dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleotide 5’-monophosphates. We conclude that TK is essential for synthesis of thymine nucleotides regardless of whether the nucleoside precursors originate from the de novo pathway or through salvage. Reliance on TK in the absence of DCTD may be a shared vulnerability among trypanosomatids and may provide a unique opportunity to selectively target a diverse group of pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes with a single drug.
","Human pathogenic trypanosomatids are responsible for several life threatening diseases, together infecting 20 million people, while treatment is complicated by poor drug therapies. The unique biology of these organisms has led to the need for different drug therapies to be developed for each. Identification of enzymatic targets that could be used to develop a single drug capable of treating multiple parasites would be revolutionary. Herein we show that the trypanosomatid biosynthetic pathway used to synthesize key precursors for DNA biosynthesis is unexpectedly vulnerable. We find that seemingly redundant enzymes thymidine kinase and cytidine deaminase are required, not for their typical role in salvaging exogenous precursors, but are instead essential for de novo synthesis of thymine nucleotides. Trypanosomatids lack alternative routes to synthesize these nucleotides, which are found in other eukaryotic cells, while encoding a previously unknown activity that degrades them. For these reasons thymidine kinase is essential to support infection in mice and has strong potential as a new drug target. While our work focused on the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, the impact of our findings may extend to other pathogenic trypanosomatids and potentially to additional single-celled eukaryotic human pathogens.

"Insect molting and metamorphosis are intricately governed by two hormones, ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones (JHs). JHs prevent precocious metamorphosis and allow the larva to undergo multiple rounds of molting until it attains the proper size for metamorphosis. In the silkworm, Bombyx mori, several “moltinism” mutations have been identified that exhibit variations in the number of larval molts; however, none of them have been characterized molecularly. Here we report the identification and characterization of the gene responsible for the dimolting (mod) mutant that undergoes precocious metamorphosis with fewer larval–larval molts. We show that the mod mutation results in complete loss of JHs in the larval hemolymph and that the mutant phenotype can be rescued by topical application of a JH analog. We performed positional cloning of mod and found a null mutation in the cytochrome P450 gene CYP15C1 in the mod allele. We also demonstrated that CYP15C1 is specifically expressed in the corpus allatum, an endocrine organ that synthesizes and secretes JHs. Furthermore, a biochemical experiment showed that CYP15C1 epoxidizes farnesoic acid to JH acid in a highly stereospecific manner. Precocious metamorphosis of mod larvae was rescued when the wild-type allele of CYP15C1 was expressed in transgenic mod larvae using the GAL4/UAS system. Our data therefore reveal that CYP15C1 is the gene responsible for the mod mutation and is essential for JH biosynthesis. Remarkably, precocious larval–pupal transition in mod larvae does not occur in the first or second instar, suggesting that authentic epoxidized JHs are not essential in very young larvae of B. mori. Our identification of a JH–deficient mutant in this model insect will lead to a greater understanding of the molecular basis of the hormonal control of development and metamorphosis.
","The number of larval instars in insects varies greatly across insect taxa and can even vary at the intraspecific level. However, little is known about how the number of larval instars is fixed in each species or modified by the environment. The silkworm, Bombyx mori, provides a unique bioresource for investigating this question, as there are several “moltinism” strains that exhibit variations in the number of larval molts. The present study describes the first positional cloning of a moltinism gene. We performed genetic and biochemical analyses on the dimolting (mod) mutant, which shows precocious metamorphosis with fewer larval–larval molts. We found that mod is a juvenile hormone (JH)–deficient mutant that is unable to synthesize JH, a hormone that prevents precocious metamorphosis and allows the larvae to undergo multiple rounds of larval–larval molts. This JH–deficient mutation is the first described to date in any insect species and, therefore, the mod strain will serve as a useful model for elucidating the molecular mechanism of JH action. Remarkably, precocious larval–pupal transition in mod larvae does not occur in the first or second instar, suggesting that morphostatic action of JH is not necessary for young larvae of B. mori.

"The circadian clock is accountable for the regulation of internal rhythms in most living organisms. It allows the anticipation of environmental changes during the day and a better adaptation of physiological processes. In mammals the main clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and synchronizes secondary clocks throughout the body. Its molecular constituents form an intracellular network which dictates circadian time and regulates clock-controlled genes. These clock-controlled genes are involved in crucial biological processes including metabolism and cell cycle regulation. Its malfunction can lead to disruption of biological rhythms and cause severe damage to the organism. The detailed mechanisms that govern the circadian system are not yet completely understood. Mathematical models can be of great help to exploit the mechanism of the circadian circuitry. We built a mathematical model for the core clock system using available data on phases and amplitudes of clock components obtained from an extensive literature search. This model was used to answer complex questions for example: how does the degradation rate of Per affect the period of the system and what is the role of the ROR/Bmal/REV-ERB (RBR) loop? Our findings indicate that an increase in the RNA degradation rate of the clock gene Period (Per) can contribute to increase or decrease of the period - a consequence of a non-monotonic effect of Per transcript stability on the circadian period identified by our model. Furthermore, we provide theoretical evidence for a potential role of the RBR loop as an independent oscillator. We carried out overexpression experiments on members of the RBR loop which lead to loss of oscillations consistent with our predictions. These findings challenge the role of the RBR loop as a merely auxiliary loop and might change our view of the clock molecular circuitry and of the function of the nuclear receptors (REV-ERB and ROR) as a putative driving force of molecular oscillations.
","Most organisms have evolved an internal clock which allows them to anticipate and react to the light/dark daily rhythm and is able to generate oscillation with a circa 24 hour rhythm. A molecular network involving feedback loops is responsible for the rhythm generation. A large number of clock-controlled genes pass on time messages and control several biological processes. In spite of its medical importance (role in cancer, sleep disorders, diabetes and others) the mechanism of action of the circadian clock and the role of its constituent's feedback loops remains partially unknown. Using a mathematical model, we were able to bring insight in open circadian biology questions. Firstly, increasing the mRNA degradation rate of Per can contribute to increase or decrease of the period which might explain contradictory experimental findings. Secondly, our data points to a more relevant role of the ROR/Bmal/REV-ERB loop. In particular, that this loop can be an oscillator on its own. We provide experimental evidence that overexpression of members of the ROR/Bmal/REV-ERB lead to loss of Bmal reporter mRNA oscillations. The fact that REV-ERB and ROR are nuclear receptors and therefore important regulators in many cellular processes might have important implications for molecular biology and medicine.

"The major DNA constituent of primate centromeres is alpha satellite DNA. As much as 2%–5% of sequence generated as part of primate genome sequencing projects consists of this material, which is fragmented or not assembled as part of published genome sequences due to its highly repetitive nature. Here, we develop computational methods to rapidly recover and categorize alpha-satellite sequences from previously uncharacterized whole-genome shotgun sequence data. We present an algorithm to computationally predict potential higher-order array structure based on paired-end sequence data and then experimentally validate its organization and distribution by experimental analyses. Using whole-genome shotgun data from the human, chimpanzee, and macaque genomes, we examine the phylogenetic relationship of these sequences and provide further support for a model for their evolution and mutation over the last 25 million years. Our results confirm fundamental differences in the dispersal and evolution of centromeric satellites in the Old World monkey and ape lineages of evolution.
","Centromeric DNA has been described as the last frontier of genomic sequencing; such regions are typically poorly assembled during the whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly process due to their repetitive complexity. This paper develops a computational algorithm to systematically extract data regarding primate centromeric DNA structure and organization from that ∼5% of sequence that is not included as part of standard genome sequence assemblies. Using this computational approach, we identify and reconstruct published human higher-order alpha satellite arrays and discover new families in human, chimpanzee, and Old World monkeys. Experimental validation confirms the utility of this computational approach to understanding the centromere organization of other nonhuman primates. An evolutionary analysis in diverse primate genomes supports fundamental differences in the structure and organization of centromere DNA between ape and Old World monkey lineages. The ability to extract meaningful biological data from random shotgun sequence data helps to fill an important void in large-scale sequencing of primate genomes, with implications for other genome sequencing projects.

"Viroporins are small transmembrane proteins with ion channel activities modulating properties of intracellular membranes that have diverse proviral functions. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes a viroporin, p7, acting during assembly, envelopment and secretion of viral particles (VP). HCV p7 is released from the viral polyprotein through cleavage at E2-p7 and p7-NS2 junctions by signal peptidase, but also exists as an E2p7 precursor, of poorly defined properties. Here, we found that ectopic p7 expression in HCVcc-infected cells reduced secretion of particle-associated E2 glycoproteins. Using biochemical assays, we show that p7 dose-dependently slows down the ER-to-Golgi traffic, leading to intracellular retention of E2, which suggested that timely E2p7 cleavage and p7 liberation are critical events to control E2 levels. By studying HCV mutants with accelerated E2p7 processing, we demonstrate that E2p7 cleavage controls E2 intracellular expression and secretion levels of nucleocapsid-free subviral particles and infectious virions. In addition, our imaging data reveal that, following p7 liberation, the amino-terminus of p7 is exposed towards the cytosol and coordinates the encounter between NS5A and NS2-based assembly sites loaded with E1E2 glycoproteins, which subsequently leads to nucleocapsid envelopment. We identify punctual mutants at p7 membrane interface that, by abrogating NS2/NS5A interaction, are defective for transmission of infectivity owing to decreased secretion of core and RNA and to increased secretion of non/partially-enveloped particles. Altogether, our results indicate that the retarded E2p7 precursor cleavage is essential to regulate the intracellular and secreted levels of E2 through p7-mediated modulation of the cell secretory pathway and to unmask critical novel assembly functions located at p7 amino-terminus.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes a viroporin, p7, acting during assembly, envelopment and secretion of viral particles. HCV p7 is produced by cleavage from the HCV polyprotein but also exists as an E2p7 precursor, of poorly defined properties. In this study, we have explored how the retarded cleavage between E2 glycoprotein and p7 viroporin could regulate their functions associated to virion assembly and/or perturbation of cellular membrane processes. Specifically, we demonstrate that p7 is able to regulate the cell secretory pathway, which induces the intracellular retention of HCV glycoproteins and favors assembly of HCV particles. Our study also identifies a novel assembly function located at p7 amino-terminus that is unmasked through E2p7-regulated processing and that controls the infectivity of different types of released viral particles. Altogether, our results underscore a critical post-translational control of assembly and secretion of HCV particles that governs their specific infectivity.

"Dipteran flies are amongst the smallest and most agile of flying animals. Their wings are driven indirectly by large power muscles, which cause cyclical deformations of the thorax that are amplified through the intricate wing hinge. Asymmetric flight manoeuvres are controlled by 13 pairs of steering muscles acting directly on the wing articulations. Collectively the steering muscles account for <3% of total flight muscle mass, raising the question of how they can modulate the vastly greater output of the power muscles during manoeuvres. Here we present the results of a synchrotron-based study performing micrometre-resolution, time-resolved microtomography on the 145 Hz wingbeat of blowflies. These data represent the first four-dimensional visualizations of an organism's internal movements on sub-millisecond and micrometre scales. This technique allows us to visualize and measure the three-dimensional movements of five of the largest steering muscles, and to place these in the context of the deforming thoracic mechanism that the muscles actuate. Our visualizations show that the steering muscles operate through a diverse range of nonlinear mechanisms, revealing several unexpected features that could not have been identified using any other technique. The tendons of some steering muscles buckle on every wingbeat to accommodate high amplitude movements of the wing hinge. Other steering muscles absorb kinetic energy from an oscillating control linkage, which rotates at low wingbeat amplitude but translates at high wingbeat amplitude. Kinetic energy is distributed differently in these two modes of oscillation, which may play a role in asymmetric power management during flight control. Structural flexibility is known to be important to the aerodynamic efficiency of insect wings, and to the function of their indirect power muscles. We show that it is integral also to the operation of the steering muscles, and so to the functional flexibility of the insect flight motor.
","A blowfly's wingbeat is 50 times shorter than a blink of a human eye, and is controlled by numerous tiny steering muscles—some of which are as thin as a human hair. To visualize the movements of these muscles and the deformations of the surrounding exoskeleton, we developed a technique to allow us to look inside the insects during tethered flight. We used a particle accelerator to record high-speed X-ray images of the flying blowflies, which we used to reconstruct three-dimensional tomograms of their flight motor at ten different stages of the wingbeat. We measured the asymmetric movements of the steering muscles associated with turning flight, together with the accompanying movements of the wing hinge—arguably the most complex joint in nature. The steering muscles represent <3% of total flight muscle mass, so a key question has been how they can modulate the output of the much larger power muscles. We show that by shifting the flight motor between different modes of oscillation, the fly is able to divert mechanical energy into a steering muscle that is specialized to absorb mechanical energy. In general, we find that deformations of the muscles and thorax are key to understanding this remarkable mechanism.

"In eukaryotic chromosomes, DNA replication initiates at multiple origins. Large inter-origin gaps arise when several adjacent origins fail to fire. Little is known about how cells cope with this situation. We created a derivative of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III lacking all efficient origins, the 5ORIΔ-ΔR fragment, as a model for chromosomes with large inter-origin gaps. We used this construct in a modified synthetic genetic array screen to identify genes whose products facilitate replication of long inter-origin gaps. Genes identified are enriched in components of the DNA damage and replication stress signaling pathways. Mrc1p is activated by replication stress and mediates transduction of the replication stress signal to downstream proteins; however, the response-defective mrc1AQ allele did not affect 5ORIΔ-ΔR fragment maintenance, indicating that this pathway does not contribute to its stability. Deletions of genes encoding the DNA-damage-specific mediator, Rad9p, and several components shared between the two signaling pathways preferentially destabilized the 5ORIΔ-ΔR fragment, implicating the DNA damage response pathway in its maintenance. We found unexpected differences between contributions of components of the DNA damage response pathway to maintenance of ORIΔ chromosome derivatives and their contributions to DNA repair. Of the effector kinases encoded by RAD53 and CHK1, Chk1p appears to be more important in wild-type cells for reducing chromosomal instability caused by origin depletion, while Rad53p becomes important in the absence of Chk1p. In contrast, RAD53 plays a more important role than CHK1 in cell survival and replication fork stability following treatment with DNA damaging agents and hydroxyurea. Maintenance of ORIΔ chromosomes does not depend on homologous recombination. These observations suggest that a DNA-damage-independent mechanism enhances ORIΔ chromosome stability. Thus, components of the DNA damage response pathway contribute to genome stability, not simply by detecting and responding to DNA template damage, but also by facilitating replication of large inter-origin gaps.
","Loss of genome integrity underlies aspects of aging and human disease. During DNA replication, two parallel signaling pathways play important roles in the maintenance of genome integrity. One pathway detects DNA damage, while the other senses replication stress. Both pathways activate responses that include arrest of cell cycle progression, giving cells time to cope with the problem. These pathways have been defined by treating cells with compounds that induce either replication stress or DNA damage, but little is known about their roles during unperturbed DNA replication. They may be important when several adjacent replication origins fail to initiate and forks from flanking origins must replicate longer regions of DNA than normal to complete replication. We have used a derivative of budding yeast chromosome III lacking all efficient replication origins to identify mutants that preferentially destabilize this chromosome fragment, which mimics a chromosome with a large inter-origin gap. We found that the DNA damage response pathway, but not the replication stress response pathway, plays an important role in maintaining this fragment. The signal recognized in this case may be replisome failure rather than forks stalled at endogenous DNA damage.

"Enhanced protein aggregation and/or impaired clearance of aggregates can lead to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, and prion diseases. Therefore, many protein quality control factors specialize in recognizing and degrading aggregation-prone proteins. Prions, which generally result from self-propagating protein aggregates, must therefore evade or outcompete these quality control systems in order to form and propagate in a cellular context. We developed a genetic screen in yeast that allowed us to explore the sequence features that promote degradation versus aggregation of a model glutamine/asparagine (Q/N)-rich prion domain from the yeast prion protein, Sup35, and two model glycine (G)-rich prion-like domains from the human proteins hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2. Unexpectedly, we found that aggregation propensity and degradation propensity could be uncoupled in multiple ways. First, only a subset of classically aggregation-promoting amino acids elicited a strong degradation response in the G-rich prion-like domains. Specifically, large aliphatic residues enhanced degradation of the prion-like domains, whereas aromatic residues promoted prion aggregation without enhancing degradation. Second, the degradation-promoting effect of aliphatic residues was suppressed in the context of the Q/N-rich prion domain, and instead led to a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of spontaneous prion formation. Degradation suppression correlated with Q/N content of the surrounding prion domain, potentially indicating an underappreciated activity for these residues in yeast prion domains. Collectively, these results provide key insights into how certain aggregation-prone proteins may evade protein quality control degradation systems.
","Protein aggregation is associated with a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Cells possess a number of factors that can recognize aggregation-prone protein features and prevent aggregation. One common way this is achieved is through the pre-emptive degradation of aggregation-prone proteins. While considerable progress has been made in understanding how the amino acid sequence of a protein relates to intrinsic aggregation propensity, little is known about how aggregation-prone proteins avoid intracellular anti-aggregation systems. We used a genetic screen in yeast to define sequence features of aggregation-prone domains that lead to degradation or prion aggregation as it occurs in the context of eukaryotic protein quality control factors. Unexpectedly, we found that only a subset of aggregation-promoting amino acids could effectively stimulate degradation of an aggregation-prone domain. Furthermore, this degradation-promoting effect could be suppressed by classical prion domain features. Our results highlight the complex interplay between pre-emptive protein degradation and protein aggregation, and implicate the unusual composition of yeast prion domains in preventing their degradation.

"Mutations in the gene for muscle phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFKM), a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, cause Type VII glycogen storage disease (GSDVII). Clinical manifestations of the disease span from the severe infantile form, leading to death during childhood, to the classical form, which presents mainly with exercise intolerance. PFKM deficiency is considered as a skeletal muscle glycogenosis, but the relative contribution of altered glucose metabolism in other tissues to the pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood. To elucidate this issue, we have generated mice deficient for PFKM (Pfkm−/−). Here, we show that Pfkm−/− mice had high lethality around weaning and reduced lifespan, because of the metabolic alterations. In skeletal muscle, including respiratory muscles, the lack of PFK activity blocked glycolysis and resulted in considerable glycogen storage and low ATP content. Although erythrocytes of Pfkm−/− mice preserved 50% of PFK activity, they showed strong reduction of 2,3-biphosphoglycerate concentrations and hemolysis, which was associated with compensatory reticulocytosis and splenomegaly. As a consequence of these haematological alterations, and of reduced PFK activity in the heart, Pfkm−/− mice developed cardiac hypertrophy with age. Taken together, these alterations resulted in muscle hypoxia and hypervascularization, impaired oxidative metabolism, fiber necrosis, and exercise intolerance. These results indicate that, in GSDVII, marked alterations in muscle bioenergetics and erythrocyte metabolism interact to produce a complex systemic disorder. Therefore, GSDVII is not simply a muscle glycogenosis, and Pfkm−/− mice constitute a unique model of GSDVII which may be useful for the design and assessment of new therapies.
","Type VII glycogen storage disease (GSDVII), or Tarui disease, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle. The molecular cause is loss of activity of the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK), which phosphorylates fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, commiting glucose to glycolysis. Entry of fructose-6-phosphate into glycolysis is thus blocked, increasing glycogen synthesis and accumulation. Clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogeneous, ranging from exercise intolerance to early childhood death. To further understand the human pathology, we generated mice lacking muscle PFK. As in human patients, these mice showed severe exercise intolerance, hemolysis, and most died young. Lack of glycolysis in skeletal muscle also causes alterations in bioenergetics and compensatory changes in key metabolic genes. Additionally, although erythrocytes retained 50% of normal PFK activity, their overall functionality was impaired, aggravating the muscle dysfunction. Moreover, marked metabolic alterations in the heart lead to chronic hypertrophy, suggesting that cardiac pathology in GSDVII may be underestimated or misdiagnosed. This study indicates that this disease is more complex than a muscle glycogenosis and that symptoms other than those classically described should be taken into consideration. Finally, this animal model will enable us to develop new therapeutic approaches and better diagnostic tools.

"We propose a minimal mathematical model for the physical basis of membrane protein patterning in the immunological synapse (IS), which encompass membrane mechanics, protein binding kinetics and motion, and fluid flow in the synaptic cleft. Our theory leads to simple predictions for the spatial and temporal scales of protein cluster formation, growth and arrest as a function of membrane stiffness, rigidity and kinetics of the adhesive proteins, and the fluid flow in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations complement these scaling laws by quantifying the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins domains on the size of the cell. Direct comparison with experiment shows that passive elastohydrodynamics and kinetics of protein binding in the synaptic cleft can describe the short-time formation and organization of protein clusters, without evoking any active processes in the cytoskeleton. Despite the apparent complexity of the process, our analysis shows that just two dimensionless parameters characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of the protein pattern: a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein stiffness, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative to the protein binding rate. A simple phase diagram encompasses the variety of patterns that can arise.
","The cellular basis for the adaptive immune response during antigen recognition relies on a specialized protein interface known as the immunological synapse (IS). Understanding the biophysical basis for protein patterning by deciphering the quantitative rules for their formation and motion is an important aspect of characterizing immune cell recognition and thence the rules for immune system activation. We propose a minimal mathematical model for the physical basis of dynamic membrane protein patterning in the IS, which encompass membrane mechanics, protein binding kinetics and motion, and fluid flow in the synaptic cleft. In particular we quantify the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins domains. We describe a phase diagram of possible protein patterns by two dimensionless parameters; a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein stiffness, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative to the protein binding rate. Direct comparison with experiment suggests that passive processes i.e. viscous fluid flow, elastic membrane bending and protein binding kinetics, can describe the short-time formation and transport of protein clusters, while active cytoskeletal processes enable long-time stabilization of the IS.

"Leprosy Type 1 reactions are a major cause of nerve damage and the
                        preventable disability that results. Type 1 reactions are treated with oral
                        corticosteroids and there are few data to support the optimal dose and
                        duration of treatment. Type 1 reactions have a Th1 immune profile: cells in
                        cutaneous and neural lesions expressing interferon-γ and interleukin-12.
                        Methylprednisolone has been used in other Th1 mediated diseases such as
                        rheumatoid arthritis in an attempt to switch off the immune response and so
                        we investigated the efficacy of three days of high dose (1 g) intravenous
                        methylprednisolone at the start of prednisolone therapy in leprosy Type 1
                        reactions and nerve function impairment.
Forty-two individuals were randomised to receive methylprednisolone followed
                        by oral prednisolone (n = 20) or oral prednisolone
                        alone (n = 22). There were no significant differences
                        in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement at the completion of
                        the study. However individuals treated with methylprednisolone were less
                        likely than those treated with prednisolone alone to experience
                        deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study.
                        The study also demonstrated that 50% of individuals with Type 1
                        reactions and/or nerve function impairment required additional prednisolone
                        despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids.
The study lends further support to the use of more prolonged courses of
                        corticosteroid to treat Type 1 reactions and the investigation of risk
                        factors for the recurrence of Type 1 reaction and nerve function impairment
                        during and after a corticosteroid treatment.

","Leprosy is caused by a bacterium and is curable with a combination of antibiotics
                    known as multi-drug therapy that patients take for six or 12 months. However a
                    significant proportion of leprosy patients experience inflammation in their skin
                    and/or nerves, which may occur even after successful completion of multi-drug
                    therapy. These episodes of inflammation are called leprosy Type 1 reactions.
                    Type 1 reactions are an important complication of leprosy because they may
                    result in nerve damage that leads to disability and deformity. Type 1 reactions
                    require treatment with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids. The
                    optimum dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy remains unclear. We
                    conducted a study to see if it would be safe to use a large dose of a
                    corticosteroid called methylprednisolone for three days at the start of a 16
                    week corticosteroid treatment regime of prednisolone in patients with leprosy
                    Type 1 reactions and leprosy patients with nerve damage present for less than
                    six months. We did this by comparing individuals who were given
                    methylprednisolone followed by prednisolone and those who received just
                    prednisolone. In this small study we did not see any significant difference in
                    the frequency of adverse events due to corticosteroid treatment in the two
                    groups. We did not demonstrate a significant difference in improvement in
                    individuals in the methylprednisolone group (who received a larger dose of
                    corticosteroids) than those in the prednisolone treated group. Overall
                    approximately 50% of individuals required more prednisolone in addition
                    to the 16 week course of treatment to prevent further nerve damage or reactions.
                    This suggests that it would be worthwhile investigating longer treatment courses
                    with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs.

"Next-generation sequencing of the exome and genome of prostate cancers has identified numerous genetic alternations. SPOP (Speckle-type POZ Protein) was one of the most frequently mutated genes in primary prostate cancer, suggesting SPOP is a potential driver of prostate cancer development and progression. However, how SPOP mutations contribute to prostate cancer pathogenesis remains poorly understood. SPOP acts as an adaptor protein of the CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that generally recruits substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. ER-localized isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2 (INF2) mediates actin polymerization at ER-mitochondria intersections and facilitates DRP1 recruitment to mitochondria, which is a critical step in mitochondrial fission. Here, we revealed that SPOP recognizes a Ser/Thr (S/T)-rich motif in the C-terminal region of INF2 and triggers atypical polyubiquitination of INF2. These ubiquitination modifications do not lead to INF2 instability, but rather reduces INF2 localization in ER and mitochondrially associated DRP1 puncta formation, therefore abrogates its ability to facilitate mitochondrial fission. INF2 mutant escaping from SPOP-mediated ubiquitination is more potent in prompting mitochondrial fission. Moreover, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants increase INF2 localization in ER and promote mitochondrial fission, probably through a dominant-negative effect to inhibit endogenous SPOP. Moreover, INF2 is important for SPOP inactivation-induced prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. These findings reveal novel molecular events underlying the regulation of INF2 function and localization, and provided insights in understanding the relationship between SPOP mutations and dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics in prostate cancer.
","Prostate cancer is the leading cause of global cancer-related death. The development of improved diagnoses and novel therapies has been confounded by significant patient heterogeneity. During recent years, significant progress has been made in identifying the molecular alterations in prostate cancer using next-generation sequencing. SPOP gene was frequently altered by somatic point mutations in a distinct molecular subclass of prostate cancer, although the precise role that SPOP mutation plays in the development of prostate cancer is unclear. Mitochondria are highly motile organelles that undergo constant fission and fusion. Unbalanced mitochondrial fission and fusion events are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and frequently linked to human cancer. Here, we are the first to report that SPOP mutations are associated with dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics in prostate cancer and this finding may have potential clinical implications in prostate cancer treatment.

"RNA viruses typically occur in genetically diverse populations due to their error-prone genome replication. Genetic diversity is thought to be important in allowing RNA viruses to explore sequence space, facilitating adaptation to changing environments and hosts. Some arboviruses that infect both a mosquito vector and a mammalian host are known to experience population bottlenecks in their vectors, which may constrain their genetic diversity and could potentially lead to extinction events via Muller's ratchet. To examine this potential challenge of bottlenecks for arbovirus perpetuation, we studied Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) enzootic subtype IE and its natural vector Culex (Melanoconion) taeniopus, as an example of a virus-vector interaction with a long evolutionary history. Using a mixture of marked VEEV clones to infect C. taeniopus and real-time RT-PCR to track these clones during mosquito infection and dissemination, we observed severe bottleneck events that resulted in a significant drop in the number of clones present. At higher initial doses, the midgut was readily infected and there was a severe bottleneck at the midgut escape. Following a lower initial dose, the major bottleneck occurred at initial midgut infection. A second, less severe bottleneck was identified at the salivary gland infection stage following intrathoracic inoculation. Our results suggest that VEEV consistently encounters bottlenecks during infection, dissemination and transmission by its natural enzootic vector. The potential impacts of these bottlenecks on viral fitness and transmission, and the viral mechanisms that prevent genetic drift leading to extinction, deserve further study.
","The ability of arboviruses to perpetuate in nature given that they must infect two disparate hosts (the mosquito vector and the vertebrate host) remains a mystery. We studied how viral genetic diversity is impacted by the dual host transmission cycle. Our studies of an enzootic cycle using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and its natural mosquito, Culex taeniopus, revealed the stages of infection that result in a viral population bottleneck. Using a set of marked VEEV clones and repeated sampling at various time points following C. taeniopus infection, we determined the number of clones in various mosquito tissues culminating in transmission. Bottlenecks were identified but the stage of occurrence was dependent on the dose that initiated infection. Understanding the points at which mosquito-borne viruses are constrained will shed light on the ways in which virus diversity varies, leading to selection of mutants that may result in host range changes or alterations in virulence.

"Q fever is a widespread zoonosis that is caused by Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii), and ruminants are identified as the main sources of human infections. Some human cases have been described, but very limited information was available about Q fever in ruminants on Reunion Island, a tropical island in the Indian Ocean. A cross-sectional study was undertaken from March 2011 to August 2012 to assess the Q fever prevalence and to identify the major risk factors of C. burnetii infection in ruminants. A total of 516 ruminants (245 cattle, 137 sheep and 134 goats) belonging to 71 farms and localized in different ecosystems of the island were randomly selected. Samples of blood, vaginal mucus and milk were concomitantly collected from females, and a questionnaire was submitted to the farmers. Ticks from positively detected farms were also collected. The overall seropositivity was 11.8% in cattle, 1.4% in sheep and 13.4% in goats. C. burnetii DNA was detected by PCR in 0.81%, 4.4% and 20.1% in cow, sheep and goat vaginal swabs, respectively. C. burnetii shedding in milk was observed in 1% of cows, 0% in sheep and 4.7% in goats. None of the ticks were detected to be positive for C. burnetii. C. burnetii infection increased when the farm was exposed to prevailing winds and when there were no specific precautions for a visitor before entering the farm, and they decreased when a proper quarantine was set up for any introduction of a new ruminant and when the animals returned to the farm at night. MLVA genotyping confirmed the role of these risk factors in infection.
","Q fever is a disease that could be transmitted from animals (cattle, sheep and goats) to humans and caused by a bacterium called Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii). Some human cases exhibiting characteristic clinical signs of that disease have been detected on Reunion Island, a tropical island in the Indian Ocean, but to date, we did not know if these animals could be seen as potential sources of the disease. Thus, a study was undertaken from March 2011 to August 2012 to detect the presence of that bacterium in these animals and to understand how they could get infected themselves. A total of 516 ruminants (245 cattle, 137 sheep and 134 goats) belonging to 71 farms and localized in different environments of the island were selected. Samples of blood, vaginal mucus and milk were concomitantly collected from females, and a questionnaire was submitted to the farmers. Ticks from positively detected farms were also collected. We observed 11.8% of cattle, 1.4% of sheep and 13.4% of goats had already been in contact with the bacterium. Coxiella burnetii was also directly detected in some vaginal and milk samples. None of the ticks were detected to be positive for C. burnetii. We found that the ruminants could be infected when their farm was exposed to prevailing winds because the bacterium can be transported by the wind, and when there were no specific precautions for visitors before entering the farm, because they could act as mechanical carriers of Coxiella. Conversely, keeping new animals under surveillance for some days to detect any signs of the disease before they enter the farm or keeping the animals in the barn at night limit the risk of infection.

"Gene regulatory networks are a crucial aspect of systems biology in describing molecular mechanisms of the cell. Various computational models rely on random gene selection to infer such networks from microarray data. While incorporation of prior knowledge into data analysis has been deemed important, in practice, it has generally been limited to referencing genes in probe sets and using curated knowledge bases. We investigate the impact of augmenting microarray data with semantic relations automatically extracted from the literature, with the view that relations encoding gene/protein interactions eliminate the need for random selection of components in non-exhaustive approaches, producing a more accurate model of cellular behavior. A genetic algorithm is then used to optimize the strength of interactions using microarray data and an artificial neural network fitness function. The result is a directed and weighted network providing the individual contribution of each gene to its target. For testing, we used invasive ductile carcinoma of the breast to query the literature and a microarray set containing gene expression changes in these cells over several time points. Our model demonstrates significantly better fitness than the state-of-the-art model, which relies on an initial random selection of genes. Comparison to the component pathways of the KEGG Pathways in Cancer map reveals that the resulting networks contain both known and novel relationships. The p53 pathway results were manually validated in the literature. 60% of non-KEGG relationships were supported (74% for highly weighted interactions). The method was then applied to yeast data and our model again outperformed the comparison model. Our results demonstrate the advantage of combining gene interactions extracted from the literature in the form of semantic relations with microarray analysis in generating contribution-weighted gene regulatory networks. This methodology can make a significant contribution to understanding the complex interactions involved in cellular behavior and molecular physiology.
","We have developed a methodology that combines standard computational analysis of gene expression data with knowledge in the literature to identify pathways of gene and protein interactions. We extract the knowledge from PubMed citations using a tool (SemRep) that identifies specific relationships between genes or proteins. We string together networks of individual interactions that are found within citations that refer to the target pathways. Upon this skeleton of interactions, we calculate the weight of the interaction with the gene expression data captured over multiple time points using state-of-the-art analysis algorithms. Not surprisingly, this approach of combining prior knowledge into the analysis process significantly improves the performance of the analysis. This work is most significant as an example of how the wealth of textual data related to gene interactions can be incorporated into computational analysis, not solely to identify this type of pathway (a gene regulatory network) but for any type of similar biological problem.

"Multidrug-resistant bacteria arise mostly by the accumulation of plasmids and chromosomal mutations. Typically, these resistant determinants are costly to the bacterial cell. Yet, recently, it has been found that, in Escherichia coli bacterial cells, a mutation conferring resistance to an antibiotic can be advantageous to the bacterial cell if another antibiotic-resistance mutation is already present, a phenomenon called sign epistasis. Here we study the interaction between antibiotic-resistance chromosomal mutations and conjugative (i.e., self-transmissible) plasmids and find many cases of sign epistasis (40%)—including one of reciprocal sign epistasis where the strain carrying both resistance determinants is fitter than the two strains carrying only one of the determinants. This implies that the acquisition of an additional resistance plasmid or of a resistance mutation often increases the fitness of a bacterial strain already resistant to antibiotics. We further show that there is an overall antagonistic interaction between mutations and plasmids (52%). These results further complicate expectations of resistance reversal by interdiction of antibiotic use.
","Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics by spontaneous mutation of chromosomal genes or through the acquisition of horizontally mobile genetic elements, mainly conjugative plasmids. Plasmid-borne resistance is widespread among bacterial pathogens. Plasmids generally entail a cost to the host, associated with the replication and maintenance of the genetic element and with the expression of its genes. Therefore, in the absence of antibiotic, both plasmids and resistance mutations are often deleterious and confer a fitness cost to the cell. Here we studied epistatic interactions between five natural conjugative plasmids and ten chromosomal mutations conferring resistance to three types of antibiotics, making a total of 50 different combinations of chromosomal mutations and conjugative plasmids. We show that sometimes plasmids confer an advantage to bacterial strains carrying resistance mutations in their chromosome. This occurs in 32% (16 out of 50) of tested combinations. Furthermore, in 5 out of 50 plasmid-mutations combinations studied (10%), we observed an increased fitness when a plasmid-bearing bacterial cell acquires a drug-resistant mutation. These examples of sign epistasis are highly unexpected. This work explains, at least in part, how multidrug resistance evolved so rapidly.

"Cyclosporin A (CsA) has important anti-microbial activity against parasites of the genus Leishmania, suggesting CsA-binding cyclophilins (CyPs) as potential drug targets. However, no information is available on the genetic diversity of this important protein family, and the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of CsA on intracellular amastigotes are only poorly understood. Here, we performed a first genome-wide analysis of Leishmania CyPs and investigated the effects of CsA on host-free L. donovani amastigotes in order to elucidate the relevance of these parasite proteins for drug development.
Multiple sequence alignment and cluster analysis identified 17 Leishmania CyPs with significant sequence differences to human CyPs, but with highly conserved functional residues implicated in PPIase function and CsA binding. CsA treatment of promastigotes resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth with an IC50 between 15 and 20 µM as demonstrated by proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis. Scanning electron microscopy revealed striking morphological changes in CsA treated promastigotes reminiscent to developing amastigotes, suggesting a role for parasite CyPs in Leishmania differentiation. In contrast to promastigotes, CsA was highly toxic to amastigotes with an IC50 between 5 and 10 µM, revealing for the first time a direct lethal effect of CsA on the pathogenic mammalian stage linked to parasite thermotolerance, independent from host CyPs. Structural modeling, enrichment of CsA-binding proteins from parasite extracts by FPLC, and PPIase activity assays revealed direct interaction of the inhibitor with LmaCyP40, a bifunctional cyclophilin with potential co-chaperone function.
The evolutionary expansion of the Leishmania CyP protein family and the toxicity of CsA on host-free amastigotes suggest important roles of PPIases in parasite biology and implicate Leishmania CyPs in key processes relevant for parasite proliferation and viability. The requirement of Leishmania CyP functions for intracellular parasite survival and their substantial divergence form host CyPs defines these proteins as prime drug targets.
","Visceral leishmanisasis, also known as Kala Azar, is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The L. donovani infectious cycle comprises two developmental stages, a motile promastigote stage that proliferates inside the digestive tract of the phlebotomine insect host, and a non-motile amastigote stage that differentiates inside the macrophages of mammalian hosts. Intracellular parasite survival in mouse and macrophage infection assays has been shown to be strongly compromised in the presence of the inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA), which binds to members of the cyclophilin (CyP) protein family. It has been suggested that the toxic effects of CsA on amastigotes occurs indirectly via host cyclophilins, which may be required for intracellular parasite development and growth. Using a host-free L. donovani culture system we revealed for the first time a direct and stage-specific effect of CsA on promastigote growth and amastigote viability. We provided evidence that parasite killing occurs through a heat sensitivity mechanism likely due to direct inhibition of the co-chaperone cyclophilin 40. Our data allow important new insights into the function of the Leishmania CyP protein family in differentiation, growth, and intracellular survival, and define this class of molecules as important drug targets.

"Every neuron is part of a network, exerting its function by transforming multiple spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns into a single spiking output. This function is specified by the particular shape and passive electrical properties of the neuronal membrane, and the composition and spatial distribution of ion channels across its processes. For a variety of physiological or pathological reasons, the intrinsic input/output function may change during a neuron’s lifetime. This process results in high variability in the peak specific conductance of ion channels in individual neurons. The mechanisms responsible for this variability are not well understood, although there are clear indications from experiments and modeling that degeneracy and correlation among multiple channels may be involved. Here, we studied this issue in biophysical models of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Using a unified data-driven simulation workflow and starting from a set of experimental recordings and morphological reconstructions obtained from rats, we built and analyzed several ensembles of morphologically and biophysically accurate single cell models with intrinsic electrophysiological properties consistent with experimental findings. The results suggest that the set of conductances expressed in any given hippocampal neuron may be considered as belonging to two groups: one subset is responsible for the major characteristics of the firing behavior in each population and the other is responsible for a robust degeneracy. Analysis of the model neurons suggests several experimentally testable predictions related to the combination and relative proportion of the different conductances that should be expressed on the membrane of different types of neurons for them to fulfill their role in the hippocampus circuitry.
","The peak conductance of many ion channel types measured in any given animal is highly variable across neurons, both within and between neuronal populations. The current view is that this occurs because a neuron needs to adapt its intrinsic electrophysiological properties either to maintain the same operative range in the presence of abnormal inputs or to compensate for the effects of pathological conditions. Limited experimental and modeling evidence suggests this might be implemented via the correlation and/or degeneracy in the function of multiple types of conductances. To study this mechanism in hippocampal CA1 neurons and interneurons, we systematically generated a set of morphologically and biophysically accurate models. We then analyzed the ensembles of peak conductance obtained for each model neuron. The results suggest that the set of conductances expressed in the various neuron types may be divided into two groups: one group is responsible for the major characteristics of the firing behavior in each population and the other is more involved with degeneracy. These models provide experimentally testable predictions on the combination and relative proportion of the different conductance types that should be present in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons.

"The average individual is expected to harbor thousands of variants within non-coding genomic regions involved in gene regulation. However, it is currently not possible to interpret reliably the functional consequences of genetic variation within any given transcription factor recognition sequence. To address this, we comprehensively analyzed heritable genome-wide binding patterns of a major sequence-specific regulator (CTCF) in relation to genetic variability in binding site sequences across a multi-generational pedigree. We localized and quantified CTCF occupancy by ChIP-seq in 12 related and unrelated individuals spanning three generations, followed by comprehensive targeted resequencing of the entire CTCF–binding landscape across all individuals. We identified hundreds of variants with reproducible quantitative effects on CTCF occupancy (both positive and negative). While these effects paralleled protein–DNA recognition energetics when averaged, they were extensively buffered by striking local context dependencies. In the significant majority of cases buffering was complete, resulting in silent variants spanning every position within the DNA recognition interface irrespective of level of binding energy or evolutionary constraint. The prevalence of complex partial or complete buffering effects severely constrained the ability to predict reliably the impact of variation within any given binding site instance. Surprisingly, 40% of variants that increased CTCF occupancy occurred at positions of human–chimp divergence, challenging the expectation that the vast majority of functional regulatory variants should be deleterious. Our results suggest that, even in the presence of “perfect” genetic information afforded by resequencing and parallel studies in multiple related individuals, genomic site-specific prediction of the consequences of individual variation in regulatory DNA will require systematic coupling with empirical functional genomic measurements.
","A comprehensive understanding of the contribution of individual genome sequences to disease and quantitative traits will require the general ability to predict consequences of genetic variation in non-protein-coding regions, particularly those involved in gene regulation. Here we tested the power to predict such consequences when presented with “complete” information encompassing the genomic DNA binding site patterns of a well-studied regulatory protein across multiple related individuals, coupled with all individual genome sequences at the binding positions. We find that, while there is reasonable ability to predict the average effects of variation within the consensus recognition sequence of a transcriptional regulator, it is not possible to determine reliably the consequences of variation at any given genomic instance. This suggests that the interpretation of individual genome sequences will require comprehensive complementation with functional genomic studies.

"Human hookworms (Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Ancylostoma ceylanicum) are intestinal blood-feeding parasites that infect ~500 million people worldwide and are among the leading causes of iron-deficiency anemia in the developing world. Drugs are useful against hookworm infections, but hookworms rapidly reinfect people, and the parasites can develop drug resistance. Therefore, having a hookworm vaccine would be of tremendous benefit.
We investigated the vaccine efficacy in outbred Syrian hamsters of three A. ceylanicum hookworm antigen candidates from two classes of proteins previously identified as promising vaccine candidates. These include two intestinally-enriched, putatively secreted cathepsin B cysteine proteases (AceyCP1, AceyCPL) and one small Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (AceySKPI3). Recombinant proteins were produced in Pichia pastoris, and adsorbed to Alhydrogel. Recombinant AceyCPL (rAceyCPL)/Alhydrogel and rAceySKPI3/Alhydrogel induced high serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers in 8/8 vaccinates, but were not protective. rAceyCP1/Alhydrogel induced intermediate serum IgG titers in ~60% of vaccinates in two different trials. rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had highly significantly decreased hookworm burdens, fecal egg counts and clinical pathology compared to Alhydrogel controls and nonresponders. Protection was highly correlated with rAceyCP1 serum IgG titer. Antisera from rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders, but not nonresponders or rAceyCPL/Alhydrogel vaccinates, significantly reduced adult A. ceylanicum motility in vitro. Furthermore, rAceyCP1 serum IgG responders had canonical Th2-specific recall responses (IL4, IL5, IL13) in splenocytes stimulated ex vivo.
These findings indicate that rAceyCP1 is a promising vaccine candidate and validates a genomic/transcriptomic approach to human hookworm vaccine discovery.
","Hookworms are voracious, blood-feeding, soil-transmitted nematode parasites. Adult hookworms infect the small intestine, causing iron-deficiency anemia and other complications. Hookworms are among the most disabling parasites of the developing world. Drugs are useful for controlling hookworm disease. However, because people often get reinfected rapidly and parasites can develop drug resistance, a vaccine that provides long-term protection would improve control and help lead to eradication. At present, there is no licensed hookworm vaccine, and progress towards a vaccine has been limited. We identified a cysteine protease in the intestine of the human hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum that is among the most strongly expressed genes during blood feeding and that may help digest blood and be essential for hookworm survival. Vaccination of hamsters with this cysteine protease gave high levels of protection when antigen-specific antibodies in the blood were induced. These antigen-specific antibodies also made hookworms less mobile in culture. This cysteine protease is a promising candidate for further investigation as a human hookworm vaccine antigen.

"Chromosomal insertions are genomic rearrangements with a chromosome segment inserted into a non-homologous chromosome or a non-adjacent locus on the same chromosome or the other homologue, constituting ~2% of nonrecurrent copy-number gains. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of their formation. We identified 16 individuals with complex insertions among 56,000 individuals tested at Baylor Genetics using clinical array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Custom high-density aCGH was performed on 10 individuals with available DNA, and breakpoint junctions were fine-mapped at nucleotide resolution by long-range PCR and DNA sequencing in 6 individuals to glean insights into potential mechanisms of formation. We observed microhomologies and templated insertions at the breakpoint junctions, resembling the breakpoint junction signatures found in complex genomic rearrangements generated by replication-based mechanism(s) with iterative template switches. In addition, we analyzed 5 families with apparently balanced insertion in one parent detected by FISH analysis and found that 3 parents had additional small copy-number variants (CNVs) at one or both sides of the inserting fragments as well as at the inserted sites. We propose that replicative repair can result in interchromosomal complex insertions generated through chromothripsis-like chromoanasynthesis involving two or three chromosomes, and cause a significant fraction of apparently balanced insertions harboring small flanking CNVs.
","By traditional cytogenetic techniques, the incidence of microscopically visible chromosomal insertions was estimated to be 1 in 80,000 live births. More recently, by aCGH in conjunction with FISH confirmation of the aCGH findings, insertion events were demonstrated to occur much more frequently (1 in ~500 individuals tested). Although frequently detected, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of their formation. In this study, we identified 16 individuals with complex chromosomal insertions among 56,000 individuals tested at Baylor Genetics using clinical microarray analysis (CMA) and FISH. Custom high-density aCGH was performed on 10 individuals with available DNA, and breakpoint junctions were fine-mapped at nucleotide resolution by long-range PCR and DNA sequencing in 6 individuals to glean insights into potential mechanisms of formation.

"Endosymbiotic bacteria from different species can live inside cells of the same eukaryotic organism. Metabolic exchanges occur between host and bacteria but also between different endocytobionts. Since a complete genome annotation is available for both, we built the metabolic network of two endosymbiotic bacteria, Sulcia muelleri and Baumannia cicadellinicola, that live inside specific cells of the sharpshooter Homalodisca coagulata and studied the metabolic exchanges involving transfers of carbon atoms between the three. We automatically determined the set of metabolites potentially exogenously acquired (seeds) for both metabolic networks. We show that the number of seeds needed by both bacteria in the carbon metabolism is extremely reduced. Moreover, only three seeds are common to both metabolic networks, indicating that the complementarity of the two metabolisms is not only manifested in the metabolic capabilities of each bacterium, but also by their different use of the same environment. Furthermore, our results show that the carbon metabolism of S. muelleri may be completely independent of the metabolic network of B. cicadellinicola. On the contrary, the carbon metabolism of the latter appears dependent on the metabolism of S. muelleri, at least for two essential amino acids, threonine and lysine. Next, in order to define which subsets of seeds (precursor sets) are sufficient to produce the metabolites involved in a symbiotic function, we used a graph-based method, PITUFO, that we recently developed. Our results highly refine our knowledge about the complementarity between the metabolisms of the two bacteria and their host. We thus indicate seeds that appear obligatory in the synthesis of metabolites are involved in the symbiotic function. Our results suggest both B. cicadellinicola and S. muelleri may be completely independent of the metabolites provided by the co-resident endocytobiont to produce the carbon backbone of the metabolites provided to the symbiotic system (., thr and lys are only exploited by B. cicadellinicola to produce its proteins).
","Some bacteria, called endocytobionts, permanently live inside the cells of a pluricellular organism and often bring an adaptative advantage to their host by providing compounds that the latter cannot produce or find in its diet. The association may involve several species of bacteria within the same host. The sap-feeding insect called glassy-winged sharpshooter thus maintains a permanent metabolic association with two different species of bacteria that it hosts within specialised cells. Complete genome annotations of the two endocytobionts allowed to reconstruction of their metabolism. By manually inspecting those annotations and comparing them to reference metabolic functions, earlier studies revealed a great complementarity between the metabolisms of the two endocytobionts and indicated potential metabolic exchanges between them. However, the metabolism of an organism is complex enough that such an approach could only give a partial description of the metabolic exchanges in the symbiotic system. We therefore determined all the metabolic exchanges in the symbiotic system by a systematic and automatic exploration of the full metabolism of the two endocytobionts in order to detail those leading to the biosynthesis of compounds involved in the symbiotic function of each bacterium. Our results highly refine our knowledge about the complementarity and the connections between the metabolisms of the two bacteria and their host.

"The extent to which direct- and cross-presentation (DP and CP) contribute to the priming of CD8+ T cell (TCD8+) responses to viruses is unclear mainly because of the difficulty in separating the two processes. Hence, while CP in the absence of DP has been clearly demonstrated, induction of an anti-viral TCD8+ response that excludes CP has never been purposely shown. Using vaccinia virus (VACV), which has been used as the vaccine to rid the world of smallpox and is proposed as a vector for many other vaccines, we show that DP is the main mechanism for the priming of an anti-viral TCD8+ response. These findings provide important insights to our understanding of how one of the most effective anti-viral vaccines induces immunity and should contribute to the development of novel vaccines.
","Professional antigen presenting cells fragment viral proteins and display some of the resulting peptides bound to MHC molecules at the cell surface. When virus-specific CD8+ T cells recognize these viral peptides they become activated, proliferate, and kill virus-infected cells to help rid the body of the virus. Two pathways have been described for the origin of the peptides presented by professional antigen presenting cells. In cross-presentation, the antigen presenting cells acquire the proteins from other cells which, in the case of a viral infection, must be infected. In direct presentation, the antigen presenting cells synthesize the proteins themselves and, therefore, during responses to viruses must be infected. However, the participation of direct presentation in anti-viral responses has never been deliberately demonstrated experimentally. In this paper we demonstrate that direct presentation occurs and is the main pathway to induce CD8+ T cells during infection with vaccinia virus. These findings provide important insights to our understanding of how one of the most effective anti-viral vaccines induces immunity and should contribute to the development of novel vaccines.

"Despite doubts about methods used and the association between vector density and dengue transmission, routine sampling of mosquito vector populations is common in dengue-endemic countries worldwide. This study examined the evidence from published studies for the existence of any quantitative relationship between vector indices and dengue cases.
From a total of 1205 papers identified in database searches following Cochrane and PRISMA Group guidelines, 18 were included for review. Eligibility criteria included 3-month study duration and dengue case confirmation by WHO case definition and/or serology.
A range of designs were seen, particularly in spatial sampling and analyses, and all but 3 were classed as weak study designs. Eleven of eighteen studies generated Stegomyia indices from combined larval and pupal data. Adult vector data were reported in only three studies. Of thirteen studies that investigated associations between vector indices and dengue cases, 4 reported positive correlations, 4 found no correlation and 5 reported ambiguous or inconclusive associations. Six out of 7 studies that measured Breteau Indices reported dengue transmission at levels below the currently accepted threshold of 5.
There was little evidence of quantifiable associations between vector indices and dengue transmission that could reliably be used for outbreak prediction. This review highlighted the need for standardized sampling protocols that adequately consider dengue spatial heterogeneity. Recommendations for more appropriately designed studies include: standardized study design to elucidate the relationship between vector abundance and dengue transmission; adult mosquito sampling should be routine; single values of Breteau or other indices are not reliable universal dengue transmission thresholds; better knowledge of vector ecology is required.

"Four studies previously indicated that the effect of malaria infection during pregnancy on the risk of low birthweight (LBW; <2,500 g) may depend upon maternal nutritional status. We investigated this dependence further using a large, diverse study population.
We evaluated the interaction between maternal malaria infection and maternal anthropometric status on the risk of LBW using pooled data from 14,633 pregnancies from 13 studies (6 cohort studies and 7 randomized controlled trials) conducted in Africa and the Western Pacific from 1996–2015. Studies were identified by the Maternal Malaria and Malnutrition (M3) initiative using a convenience sampling approach and were eligible for pooling given adequate ethical approval and availability of essential variables. Study-specific adjusted effect estimates were calculated using inverse probability of treatment-weighted linear and log-binomial regression models and pooled using a random-effects model. The adjusted risk of delivering a baby with LBW was 8.8% among women with malaria infection at antenatal enrollment compared to 7.7% among uninfected women (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 1.42]; N = 13,613), 10.5% among women with malaria infection at delivery compared to 7.9% among uninfected women (aRR 1.32 [95% CI: 1.08, 1.62]; N = 11,826), and 15.3% among women with low mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC <23 cm) at enrollment compared to 9.5% among women with MUAC ≥ 23 cm (aRR 1.60 [95% CI: 1.36, 1.87]; N = 9,008). The risk of delivering a baby with LBW was 17.8% among women with both malaria infection and low MUAC at enrollment compared to 8.4% among uninfected women with MUAC ≥ 23 cm (joint aRR 2.13 [95% CI: 1.21, 3.73]; N = 8,152). There was no evidence of synergism (i.e., excess risk due to interaction) between malaria infection and MUAC on the multiplicative (p = 0.5) or additive scale (p = 0.9). Results were similar using body mass index (BMI) as an anthropometric indicator of nutritional status. Meta-regression results indicated that there may be multiplicative interaction between malaria infection at enrollment and low MUAC within studies conducted in Africa; however, this finding was not consistent on the additive scale, when accounting for multiple comparisons, or when using other definitions of malaria and malnutrition. The major limitations of the study included availability of only 2 cross-sectional measurements of malaria and the limited availability of ultrasound-based pregnancy dating to assess impacts on preterm birth and fetal growth in all studies.
Pregnant women with malnutrition and malaria infection are at increased risk of LBW compared to women with only 1 risk factor or none, but malaria and malnutrition do not act synergistically.
","More than 125 million pregnant women are at risk of malaria in pregnancy annually, producing detrimental effects on maternal, newborn, and infant health.
Maternal undernutrition is estimated to be responsible for 800,000 newborn deaths annually.
Prior evidence from 4 small studies indicated that the harmful impact of malaria on fetal growth and birthweight (BW) may depend upon the macronutrient nutritional status of the mother.
If malaria and maternal undernutrition have synergistic negative impacts on pregnancy outcomes, interventions targeted to high-risk women might provide substantial public benefit.
The present study provides a robust assessment of potential malaria–nutrition interactions in pregnancy and overcomes size and methodological limitations of earlier exploratory studies.
We present a large, pooled analysis of individual participant data from 13 studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and the Western Pacific investigating the interaction between maternal malaria infection and malnutrition on the risk of low birthweight (LBW) and reduced mean BW.
The findings suggest that women who are both infected with malaria and malnourished are at greater risk of LBW than their uninfected, well-nourished counterparts.
However, the study found no conclusive evidence of interaction between the 2, i.e., the impact of malaria on BW was independent of the macronutrient nutritional status of the mother.
Subgroup analyses did find that studies conducted just in Africa had slight evidence of interaction, but this was not consistent throughout all analyses.
Although there was no overall evidence of malaria–nutrition interactions, more than 1 in 3 pregnant women suffered from malaria and/or undernutrition, emphasizing the importance of joint approaches to decrease maternal malaria and improve nutrition to minimize adverse pregnancy outcomes.

"A transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) constitutes the collection of regulatory rules that link environmental cues to the transcription state of a cell's genome. We recently proposed a matrix formalism that quantitatively represents a system of such rules (a transcriptional regulatory system [TRS]) and allows systemic characterization of TRS properties. The matrix formalism not only allows the computation of the transcription state of the genome but also the fundamental characterization of the input-output mapping that it represents. Furthermore, a key advantage of this “pseudo-stoichiometric” matrix formalism is its ability to easily integrate with existing stoichiometric matrix representations of signaling and metabolic networks. Here we demonstrate for the first time how this matrix formalism is extendable to large-scale systems by applying it to the genome-scale Escherichia coli TRS. We analyze the fundamental subspaces of the regulatory network matrix (R) to describe intrinsic properties of the TRS. We further use Monte Carlo sampling to evaluate the E. coli transcription state across a subset of all possible environments, comparing our results to published gene expression data as validation. Finally, we present novel in silico findings for the E. coli TRS, including (1) a gene expression correlation matrix delineating functional motifs; (2) sets of gene ontologies for which regulatory rules governing gene transcription are poorly understood and which may direct further experimental characterization; and (3) the appearance of a distributed TRN structure, which is in stark contrast to the more hierarchical organization of metabolic networks.
","Cells are comprised of genomic information that encodes for proteins, the basic building blocks underlying all biological processes. A transcriptional regulatory system (TRS) connects a cell's environmental cues to its genome and in turn determines which genes are turned “on” in response to these cues. Consequently, TRSs control which proteins of an intracellular biochemical reaction network are present. These systems have been mathematically described, often through Boolean expressions that represent the activation or inhibition of gene transcription in response to various inputs. We recently developed a matrix formalism that extends these approaches and facilitates a quantitative representation of the Boolean logic underlying a TRS. We demonstrated on small-scale TRSs that this matrix representation is advantageous in that it facilitates the calculation of unique properties of a given TRS. Here we apply this matrix formalism to the genome-scale Escherichia coli TRS, demonstrating for the first time the predictive power of the approach at a large scale. We use the matrix-based model of E. coli transcriptional regulation to generate novel findings about the system, including new functional motifs; sets of genes whose regulation is poorly understood; and features of the TRS structure.

"The midgut microbial community in insect vectors of disease is crucial for an effective immune response against infection with various human and animal pathogens. Depending on the aspects of their development, insects can acquire microbes present in soil, water, and plants. Sand flies are major vectors of leishmaniasis, and shown to harbor a wide variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Sand fly larval stages acquire microorganisms from the soil, and the abundance and distribution of these microorganisms may vary depending on the sand fly species or the breeding site. Here, we assess the distribution of two bacteria commonly found within the gut of sand flies, Pantoea agglomerans and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that these bacteria are able to differentially infect the larval digestive tract, and regulate the immune response in sand fly larvae. Moreover, bacterial distribution, and likely the ability to colonize the gut, is driven, at least in part, by a gradient of pH present in the gut.
","Symbiotic microorganisms influence many aspects of the physiology of their hosts. In insects, symbiotic bacteria are able among other things to modulate the immune response and the development of the insect from larval stages to adult. Many bacteria first gain access to insect tissues, such as the gut, during larval development, and are acquired from the environment. Thus, depending on the insect ecology, aquatic vs. terrestrial, the bacterial gut flora found in insects can vary widely. Little is known about the events that follow bacterial infection in larval guts and the driving forces for colonization of the gut by such bacteria. We investigated the distribution of two bacteria, a Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and a Gram-negative (Pantoea agglomerans) fed to sand fly larvae. Our results indicate that bacteria distribution in the larval gut is driven by their ability to multiply at a given pH, as pH in the gut also varies. Gut distribution by these bacteria lead to an immune response that the sand fly larva is able to modulate according to the bacterial species. Our findings can influence development of paratransgenic approaches that utilize bacterial symbionts to control vector population.

"Hookworm infection is considered one of the most important poverty-promoting neglected tropical diseases, infecting 576 to 740 million people worldwide, especially in the tropics and subtropics. These blood-feeding nematodes have a remarkable ability to downmodulate the host immune response, protecting themselves from elimination and minimizing severe host pathology. While several mechanisms may be involved in the immunomodulation by parasitic infection, experimental evidences have pointed toward the possible involvement of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in downregulating effector T-cell responses upon chronic infection. However, the role of Tregs cells in human hookworm infection is still poorly understood and has not been addressed yet. In the current study we observed an augmentation of circulating CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in hookworm-infected individuals compared with healthy non-infected donors. We have also demonstrated that infected individuals present higher levels of circulating Treg cells expressing CTLA-4, GITR, IL-10, TGF-β and IL-17. Moreover, we showed that hookworm crude antigen stimulation reduces the number of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T regulatory cells co-expressing IL-17 in infected individuals. Finally, PBMCs from infected individuals pulsed with excreted/secreted products or hookworm crude antigens presented an impaired cellular proliferation, which was partially augmented by the depletion of Treg cells. Our results suggest that Treg cells may play an important role in hookworm-induced immunosuppression, contributing to the longevity of hookworm survival in infected people.
","The hookworm infection is characterized by the long-term survival of the parasite and the concomitant modulation of the host immunity. Among several mechanisms that may account for the suppression of T cell response, we here described the presence and role of T regulatory cells (also known as Tregs) in the human hookworm infection. Tregs are a minor subpopulation of CD4+ T-cells, which also express specific cell markers that allow its further identification (CD25 and FOXP3). Our results showed that hookworm infection induce an augmentation of Tregs in the peripheral blood, followed by the higher levels of circulating Treg cells expressing several markers and cytokines associated with cell regulation (CTLA-4, GITR, IL-10, TGF-β and IL-17). We also demonstrated that in vitro depletion of Tregs partially enhanced the naturally impaired cellular proliferation of lymphocytes from infected individuals after antigenic stimulation. Our results suggest that Treg cells may play an important role in hookworm-induced immunosuppression, contributing to the longevity of hookworm survival in infected people.

"West Nile virus (WNV) can persist long term in the brain and kidney tissues of humans, non-human primates, and hamsters. In this study, mice were infected with WNV strain H8912, previously cultured from the urine of a persistently infected hamster, to determine its pathogenesis in a murine host.
We found that WNV H8912 was highly attenuated for neuroinvasiveness in mice. Following a systemic infection, viral RNA could be detected quickly in blood and spleen and much later in kidneys. WNV H8912 induced constitutive IL-10 production, upregulation of IFN-β and IL-1β expression, and a specific IgM response on day 10 post-infection. WNV H8912 persisted preferentially in kidneys with mild renal inflammation, and less frequently in spleen for up to 2.5 months post infection. This was concurrent with detectable serum WNV-specific IgM and IgG production. There were also significantly fewer WNV- specific T cells and lower inflammatory responses in kidneys than in spleen. Previous studies have shown that systemic wild-type WNV NY99 infection induced virus persistence preferentially in spleen than in mouse kidneys. Here, we noted that splenocytes of WNV H8912-infected mice produced significantly less IL-10 than those of WNV NY99-infected mice. Finally, WNV H8912 was also attenuated in neurovirulence. Following intracranial inoculation, WNV persisted in the brain at a low frequency, concurrent with neither inflammatory responses nor neuronal damage in the brain.
WNV H8912 is highly attenuated in both neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence in mice. It induces a low and delayed anti-viral response in mice and preferentially persists in the kidneys.
","West Nile virus (WNV) has been reported to persist long term in the brain and kidney tissues of humans, non-human primates, and hamsters. To define a murine model of persistent WNV renal infection, we characterized infection by WNV H8912, an isolate cultured previously from the urine of a persistently infected hamster. Our findings indicate that WNV strain H8912 is highly attenuated in both neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence for mice. The virus persisted preferentially in kidneys of the mouse, and less frequently in the spleen and the brain. Moreover, mice infected with WNV H8912 had a delayed induction of IFN- β and IL-1β expression and WNV- specific IgM response, but a constitutive production of serum IL-10. There was a lower proinflammatory response in mouse kidneys when compared to equivalent findings in the spleen. This response may lead to a reduced T cell response in kidneys, which could ultimately contribute to renal-specific WNV persistence. Defining a murine model of WNV persistence by using a well-characterized, hamster-derived WNV urine isolate should provide important insights into understanding the mechanisms of WNV persistence.

"RNA silencing is an evolutionarily conserved sequence-specific gene-inactivation system that also functions as an antiviral mechanism in higher plants and insects. To overcome antiviral RNA silencing, viruses express silencing-suppressor proteins. These viral proteins can target one or more key points in the silencing machinery. Here we show that in Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV, type member of the Ipomovirus genus, family Potyviridae), the role of silencing suppressor is played by the P1 protein (the largest serine protease among all known potyvirids) despite the presence in its genome of an HC-Pro protein, which, in potyviruses, acts as the suppressor. Using in vivo studies we have demonstrated that SPMMV P1 inhibits si/miRNA-programmed RISC activity. Inhibition of RISC activity occurs by binding P1 to mature high molecular weight RISC, as we have shown by immunoprecipitation. Our results revealed that P1 targets Argonaute1 (AGO1), the catalytic unit of RISC, and that suppressor/binding activities are localized at the N-terminal half of P1. In this region three WG/GW motifs were found resembling the AGO-binding linear peptide motif conserved in metazoans and plants. Site-directed mutagenesis proved that these three motifs are absolutely required for both binding and suppression of AGO1 function. In contrast to other viral silencing suppressors analyzed so far P1 inhibits both existing and de novo formed AGO1 containing RISC complexes. Thus P1 represents a novel RNA silencing suppressor mechanism. The discovery of the molecular bases of P1 mediated silencing suppression may help to get better insight into the function and assembly of the poorly explored multiprotein containing RISC.
","RNA silencing is an evolutionarily conserved sequence-specific gene-inactivation system that also functions as a major antiviral mechanism in higher plants and insects. Viral RNAs are processed by Dicer-like proteins into small interfering (si) RNAs, which trigger the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly. Then siRNA loaded RISC inactivates cognate viral RNA. However, viral silencing suppressors evolved to counteract with RNA silencing targeting one or more key points in the silencing machinery. Here we show that in Sweet potato mild mottle virus, the role of silencing suppressor is played by P1 protein and it works by inhibiting si/miRNA-loaded RISC through targeting Argonaute 1 (AGO1). We confirmed using immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays that the interaction between P1 and small RNA loaded AGO1 is specific and direct. The suppression activity mapped to the N-terminal part of P1 containing three WG/GW motifs that resemble the AGO-binding linear peptide motif conserved in metazoans and plants. Site-directed mutagenesis proved that these three motifs are essential for both binding and suppression of AGO1 function. P1 protein is the only silencing suppressor identified so far that inhibits active RISC and this is the first demonstration of a WG/GW protein having negative effect on RNA silencing.

"The burden of human leptospirosis in Uganda is unknown. We estimated the seroprevalence of Leptospira antibodies, probable acute/recent leptospirosis, and risk factors for seropositivity in humans in rural Western Uganda.
359 non-pregnant adults visiting the Kikuube and Kigorobya Health Centers were sequentially recruited during March and April 2014. A health history survey and serum were collected from consented participants. Overall, 69% reported having fever in the past year, with 49% reporting malaria, 14% malaria relapse, 6% typhoid fever, 3% brucellosis, and 0% leptospirosis. We tested sera by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) against eight Leptospira serovars representing seven serogroups. Leptospira seroprevalence was 35% (126/359; 95%CI 30.2–40.3%) defined as MAT titer ≥ 1:100 for any serovar. The highest prevalence was against L. borgpetersenii Nigeria (serogroup Pyrogenes) at 19.8% (71/359; 95%CI 15.9–24.4%). The prevalence of probable recent leptospirosis (MAT titer ≥1:800) was 1.9% (95%CI 0.9–4.2%) and uniquely related to serovar Nigeria (serogroup Pyrogenes). Probable recent leptospirosis was associated with having self-reported malaria within the past year (p = 0.048). Higher risk activities included skinning cattle (n = 6) with 12.3 higher odds (95%CI 1.4–108.6; p = 0.024) of Leptospira seropositivity compared with those who had not. Participants living in close proximity to monkeys (n = 229) had 1.92 higher odds (95%CI 1.2–3.1; p = 0.009) of seropositivity compared with participants without monkeys nearby.
The 35% prevalence of Leptospira antibodies suggests that exposure to leptospirosis is common in rural Uganda, in particular the Nigeria serovar (Pyrogenes serogroup). Leptospirosis should be a diagnostic consideration in febrile illness and “smear-negative malaria” in rural East Africa.
","Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Despite its relatively common frequency, mild/moderate leptospirosis often goes unrecognized, due to its usually non-specific symptoms of fever, vomiting, and malaise. Knowledge of leptospirosis in Uganda is limited, and the disease may often be misdiagnosed as malaria. This study sought to define the percentage of healthcare seeking Ugandans in rural Western Uganda who have antibodies to Leptospira in their blood, suggesting prior exposure. We found 35% of study participants had antibodies to at least one Leptospira serovar, predominantly L. borgpetersenii sv Nigeria representing the Pyrogenes serogroup (20% of all participants). Individuals with increased odds of having antibodies to leptospires included participants who skinned cattle and those who reported monkeys near their home. Individuals who self-reported recent diagnosis of malaria were more likely to have leptospirosis antibodies. Antibodies to leptospirosis are not lifelong, typically lasting a few years. The high 35% seroprevalence suggests there is ongoing exposure. Further studies are needed to understand the burden of leptospirosis in rural Africa, the risk factors associated with exposure, and the public health opportunities to mitigate leptospirosis.

"The dynamics of the cellular proportion of mutant mtDNA molecules is crucial for mitochondrial diseases. Cellular populations of mitochondria are under homeostatic control, but the details of the control mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we use stochastic modelling to derive general results for the impact of cellular control on mtDNA populations, the cost to the cell of different mtDNA states, and the optimisation of therapeutic control of mtDNA populations. This formalism yields a wealth of biological results, including that an increasing mtDNA variance can increase the energetic cost of maintaining a tissue, that intermediate levels of heteroplasmy can be more detrimental than homoplasmy even for a dysfunctional mutant, that heteroplasmy distribution (not mean alone) is crucial for the success of gene therapies, and that long-term rather than short intense gene therapies are more likely to beneficially impact mtDNA populations.
","Mitochondria, best known for their role in energy production, are crucial to the survival of most of our cells. To respond to energetic demands and mitigate against mutational damage, cells control the mitochondrial populations within them. However, the character of these control mechanisms remains open. As experimental elucidation of these mechanisms is challenging, theoretical approaches can help us understand the general principles of cellular control of mitochondria in physiology and disease. Here, we use stochastic modelling to compare control strategies by studying their impact on the dynamics of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) populations as well as their energetic burden to the cell. We identify optimal strategies for the cell to control against mtDNA damage and preserve energy production and use this theory to explore the action of recently developed mitochondrial gene therapies, which reduce the fraction of mutant mtDNA molecules inside cells. We show how treatment efficiency may depend on pre-treatment distributions of mutant and wildtype mtDNA molecules: treatments are less effective for tissues consisting of cells with highly varying mutant levels, and long-term, rather than short intense, gene therapies should be favoured.

"The primordial organization of the metazoan body is achieved during gastrulation by the establishment of the germ layers. Adhesion differences between ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm cells could in principle be sufficient to maintain germ layer integrity and prevent intermixing. However, in organisms as diverse as fly, fish, or amphibian, the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary not only keeps these germ layers separated, but the ectoderm also serves as substratum for mesoderm migration, and the boundary must be compatible with repeated cell attachment and detachment.
We show that localized detachment resulting from contact-induced signals at the boundary is at the core of ectoderm-mesoderm segregation. Cells alternate between adhesion and detachment, and detachment requires ephrinB/EphB signaling. Multiple ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors are expressed on each side of the boundary, and tissue separation depends on forward signaling across the boundary in both directions, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and RhoA.
This mechanism differs from a simple differential adhesion process of germ layer formation. Instead, it involves localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle which allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum.
","The formation and maintenance of tissue boundaries is an essential feature of multicellular animals, including humans. Using the frog embryo as a model system, we describe a mechanism of tissue separation that involves repeated cycles of cell attachment and detachment at the boundary between two adjacent tissues. Molecularly, this mechanism is based on a signal exchange across the boundary by a system of receptors and ligands—EphB receptors and ephrinB ligands—that are both integral cell membrane proteins, and thus require direct cell contact for signaling. In this way, cell attachment-dependent contact induces signaling which leads to a temporary detachment, followed by reattachment and a next round of signaling. Such an attachment-detachment mechanism allows for cell migration along the boundary, while at the same time preventing invasion of the stationary tissue by the migrating one.

"Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, represents a very important public health problem in Latin America where it is endemic. Although mostly asymptomatic at its initial stage, after the disease becomes chronic, about a third of the infected patients progress to a potentially fatal outcome due to severe damage of heart and gut tissues. There is an urgent need for new drugs against Chagas disease since there are only two drugs available, benznidazole and nifurtimox, and both show toxic side effects and variable efficacy against the chronic stage of the disease.
Genetically engineered parasitic strains are used for high throughput screening (HTS) of large chemical collections in the search for new anti-parasitic compounds. These assays, although successful, are limited to reporter transgenic parasites and do not cover the wide T. cruzi genetic background. With the aim to contribute to the early drug discovery process against Chagas disease we have developed an automated image-based 384-well plate HTS assay for T. cruzi amastigote replication in a rat myoblast host cell line. An image analysis script was designed to inform on three outputs: total number of host cells, ratio of T. cruzi amastigotes per cell and percentage of infected cells, which respectively provides one host cell toxicity and two T. cruzi toxicity readouts. The assay was statistically robust (Z´ values >0.6) and was validated against a series of known anti-trypanosomatid drugs.
We have established a highly reproducible, high content HTS assay for screening of chemical compounds against T. cruzi infection of myoblasts that is amenable for use with any T. cruzi strain capable of in vitro infection. Our visual assay informs on both anti-parasitic and host cell toxicity readouts in a single experiment, allowing the direct identification of compounds selectively targeted to the parasite.
","Chagas disease is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Endemic to Central and South America, it affects over 10 million people and many more live in risk transmission areas. Although mostly asymptomatic at its initial acute stage in humans, damages can occur over the years in many tissues such as T. cruzi-hosting heart and digestive track. For over 40 years the chemotherapy of Chagas disease has relied on the use of two drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, though both are known to lead to severe side effects which often prompt to the discontinuation of the treatments. Despite having good efficacy against the acute stage of infection, its efficacy against the chronic stage is under question. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need of new anti-T. cruzi drugs. Several efforts have been made in the last years to establish reliable high throughput cell based in vitro assays to be used for drug discovery against Chagas. With the aim to contribute to this field here we describe the development of a new automated image-based assay to identify new compounds against T. cruzi that has been set up using the myoblastic rat cell line H9c2 as cell-cycling amastigotes hosting cells.

"State-space and action representations form the building blocks of decision-making processes in the brain; states map external cues to the current situation of the agent whereas actions provide the set of motor commands from which the agent can choose to achieve specific goals. Although these factors differ across environments, it is currently unknown whether or how accurately state and action representations are acquired by the agent because previous experiments have typically provided this information a priori through instruction or pre-training. Here we studied how state and action representations adapt to reflect the structure of the world when such a priori knowledge is not available. We used a sequential decision-making task in rats in which they were required to pass through multiple states before reaching the goal, and for which the number of states and how they map onto external cues were unknown a priori. We found that, early in training, animals selected actions as if the task was not sequential and outcomes were the immediate consequence of the most proximal action. During the course of training, however, rats recovered the true structure of the environment and made decisions based on the expanded state-space, reflecting the multiple stages of the task. Similarly, we found that the set of actions expanded with training, although the emergence of new action sequences was sensitive to the experimental parameters and specifics of the training procedure. We conclude that the profile of choices shows a gradual shift from simple representations to more complex structures compatible with the structure of the world.
","Everyday decision-making tasks typically require taking multiple actions and passing through multiple states before reaching desired goals. Such states constitute the state-space of the task. Here we show that, contrary to current assumptions, the state-space is not static but rather expands during training as subjects discover new states that help them efficiently solve the task. Similarly, within the same task, we show that subjects initially only consider taking simple actions, but as training progresses the set of actions can expand to include useful action sequences that reach the goal directly by passing through multiple states. These results provide evidence that state-space and action representations are not static but are acquired and then adapted to reflect the structure of the world.

"The insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in stress resistance and longevity, but the mechanisms are not fully characterized. To identify genes that mediate stress resistance, we screened for C. elegans mutants that can tolerate high levels of dietary zinc. We identified natc-1, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase C (NAT) complex. N-terminal acetylation is a widespread modification of eukaryotic proteins; however, relatively little is known about the biological functions of NATs. We demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in natc-1 cause resistance to a broad-spectrum of physiologic stressors, including multiple metals, heat, and oxidation. The C. elegans FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is a critical target of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway that mediates stress resistance, and DAF-16 is predicted to directly bind the natc-1 promoter. To characterize the regulation of natc-1 by DAF-16 and the function of natc-1 in insulin/IGF-1 signaling, we analyzed molecular and genetic interactions with key components of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway. natc-1 mRNA levels were repressed by DAF-16 activity, indicating natc-1 is a physiological target of DAF-16. Genetic studies suggested that natc-1 functions downstream of daf-16 to mediate stress resistance and dauer formation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that natc-1 is directly regulated by the DAF-16 transcription factor, and natc-1 is a physiologically significant effector of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway that mediates stress resistance and dauer formation. These studies identify a novel biological function for natc-1 as a modulator of stress resistance and dauer formation and define a functionally significant downstream effector of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Protein N-terminal acetylation mediated by the NatC complex may play an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating stress resistance.
","What are the mechanisms used by animals to cope with stressful environments that inflict damage or restrict essential processes such as growth, development, and reproduction? One strategy is changes in physiology that increase stress resistance, and an extreme version of this strategy is diapause, an alternative developmental state that is enduring and stress resistant. In the nematode C. elegans, stress tolerance and entry into a diapause state called dauer larvae are mediated by the conserved insulin/IGF-1 pathway. Specifically, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 promotes stress tolerance and dauer larvae development. However, the targets of DAF-16 that mediate these processes remain largely elusive. Using an unbiased forward genetic screen to discover new mediators of stress tolerance, we identified natc-1, a novel target of DAF-16 and the insulin/IGF-1 pathway. natc-1 encodes a conserved subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase C (NAT) complex. The NatC complex modifies target proteins by acetylating the N-terminus. We demonstrated that natc-1 mediates diapause entry and stress tolerance. Furthermore, we elucidated regulation of NatC by demonstrating that natc-1 is a direct transcriptional target that is repressed by DAF-16. These findings may be relevant to other animals because both the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and the NAT system are conserved during evolution.

"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the most important virulence and antigenic components of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis. LPS diversity in B. pseudomallei has been described as typical, atypical or rough, based upon banding patterns on SDS-PAGE. Here, we studied the genetic and molecular basis of these phenotypic differences. Bioinformatics was used to determine the diversity of genes known or predicted to be involved in biosynthesis of the O-antigenic moiety of LPS in B. pseudomallei and its near-relative species. Multiplex-PCR assays were developed to target diversity of the O-antigen biosynthesis gene patterns or LPS genotypes in B. pseudomallei populations. We found that the typical LPS genotype (LPS genotype A) was highly prevalent in strains from Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia, whereas the atypical LPS genotype (LPS genotype B) was most often detected in Australian strains (∼13.8%). In addition, we report a novel LPS ladder pattern, a derivative of the atypical LPS phenotype, associated with an uncommon O-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster that is found in only a small B. pseudomallei sub-population. This new LPS group was designated as genotype B2. We also report natural mutations in the O-antigen biosynthesis genes that potentially cause the rough LPS phenotype. We postulate that the diversity of LPS may correlate with differential immunopathogenicity and virulence among B. pseudomallei strains.
","Burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental Gram-negative bacterium and the cause of melioidosis, an often life-threatening disease affecting people in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Melioidosis is usually contracted by bacterial inoculation, ingestion or inhalation. Effective vaccines for melioidosis are currently unavailable. This organism contains a large genome, which varies greatly among strains due to a high frequency of genetic recombination. We report here on diversity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in this species, a major component of the bacterial outer membrane and a known immunogenic virulence factor. We developed LPS genotyping techniques to study frequency of two major LPS types, known as typical and atypical LPS, in B. pseudomallei strains collected from two endemic regions: Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. LPS genotype variation differed among B. pseudomallei populations. During the investigation, we discovered a new LPS genotype in a sub-population group of B. pseudomallei in Australia. We postulate that such differences are likely to be associated with variable immunopathogenicity and clinical presentation in the human host.

"Cells typically vary in their response to extracellular ligands. Receptor transport processes modulate ligand-receptor induced signal transduction and impact the variability in cellular responses. Here, we quantitatively characterized cellular variability in erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) trafficking at the single-cell level based on live-cell imaging and mathematical modeling. Using ensembles of single-cell mathematical models reduced parameter uncertainties and showed that rapid EpoR turnover, transport of internalized EpoR back to the plasma membrane, and degradation of Epo-EpoR complexes were essential for receptor trafficking. EpoR trafficking dynamics in adherent H838 lung cancer cells closely resembled the dynamics previously characterized by mathematical modeling in suspension cells, indicating that dynamic properties of the EpoR system are widely conserved. Receptor transport processes differed by one order of magnitude between individual cells. However, the concentration of activated Epo-EpoR complexes was less variable due to the correlated kinetics of opposing transport processes acting as a buffering system.
","Cell surface receptors translate extracellular ligand concentrations to intracellular responses. Receptor transport between the plasma membrane and other cellular compartments regulates the number of accessible receptors at the plasma membrane that determines the strength of downstream pathway activation at a given ligand concentration. In cell populations, pathway activation strength and cellular responses vary between cells. Understanding origins of cell-to-cell variability is highly relevant for cancer research, motivated by the problem of fractional killing by chemotherapies and development of resistance in subpopulations of tumor cells. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is a characteristic example of a receptor system that strongly depends on receptor transport processes. It is involved in several cellular processes, such as differentiation or proliferation, regulates the renewal of erythrocytes, and is expressed in several tumors. To investigate the involvement of receptor transport processes in cell-to-cell variability, we quantitatively characterized trafficking of EpoR in individual cells by combining live-cell imaging with mathematical modeling. Thereby, we found that EpoR dynamics was strongly dependent on rapid receptor transport and turnover. Interestingly, although transport processes largely differed between individual cells, receptor concentrations in cellular compartments were robust to variability in trafficking processes due to the correlated kinetics of opposing transport processes.

"Decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, through which a decision maker monitors uncertainty regarding a decision and may then consequently revise the decision. These metacognitive processes can occur prior to or in the absence of feedback. However, the neural mechanisms of metacognition remain controversial. One theory proposes an independent neural system for metacognition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); the other, that metacognitive processes coincide and overlap with the systems used for the decision-making process per se. In this study, we devised a novel “decision–redecision” paradigm to investigate the neural metacognitive processes involved in redecision as compared to the initial decision-making process. The participants underwent a perceptual decision-making task and a rule-based decision-making task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that the anterior PFC, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), were more extensively activated after the initial decision. The dACC activity in redecision positively scaled with decision uncertainty and correlated with individual metacognitive uncertainty monitoring abilities—commonly occurring in both tasks—indicating that the dACC was specifically involved in decision uncertainty monitoring. In contrast, the lFPC activity seen in redecision processing was scaled with decision uncertainty reduction and correlated with individual accuracy changes—positively in the rule-based decision-making task and negatively in the perceptual decision-making task. Our results show that the lFPC was specifically involved in metacognitive control of decision adjustment and was subject to different control demands of the tasks. Therefore, our findings support that a separate neural system in the PFC is essentially involved in metacognition and further, that functions of the PFC in metacognition are dissociable.
","Decision-making is often accompanied by a sense of uncertainty regarding the outcome. In many situations, there is no explicit feedback or cue to indicate whether the decision is correct or not. Fortunately, our brain can evaluate decision uncertainty using the internal signals and subsequently make appropriate adjustments to initial decisions. The process of considering the outcome of a decision and whether a decision should be adjusted is called metacognition, and it tends to be automatically induced. Thus, decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, and the two processes are inevitably coupled. However, the neural systems supporting metacognitive processing remain unclear and have often been misattributed to the neural system of the decision-making process per se. Here, we have analyzed this process in several volunteers by imaging the brain activity in specific regions while they performed Sudoku and random-dot motion (RDM) tasks. Our results suggest the existence of a neural system located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mainly involved in metacognition and independent from the neural system of decision-making.

"The central nervous system develops from monolayered neuroepithelial sheets. In a first step patterning mechanisms subdivide the seemingly uniform epithelia into domains allowing an increase of neuronal diversity in a tightly controlled spatial and temporal manner. In Drosophila, neuroepithelial patterning of the embryonic optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primordium, consisting of two photoreceptor (PR) precursor types (primary and secondary), as well as the optic lobe primordium, which during larval and pupal stages develops into the prominent optic ganglia. Here, we characterize a genetic network that regulates the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as between primary and secondary PR precursors. In a first step the proneural factor Atonal (Ato) specifies larval eye precursors, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless (Tll) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. The correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll in turn is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors. In a second step, Notch signaling also controls a binary cell fate decision, thus, acts at the top of a cascade of transcription factor interactions to define PR subtype identity. Our model serves as an example of how combinatorial action of cell extrinsic and cell intrinsic factors control neural tissue patterning.
","Genetic mechanisms patterning neuroepithelial domains are a critical first step to diversify cellular identity of the developing nervous system. How many cells develop from distinct neuroepithelial domains depends on overall size and growth but also on positioning of boundaries. Using the embryonic optic placode of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we identify basic genetic mechanisms of how distinct domains with different fates emerge from an early, seemingly uniform, neurogenic region. We show that the boundary between two transcription factors is critical to determine how many cells are incorporated in either domain. This is achieved by coordinated interaction of Hedgehog and Notch signaling, which control proliferation and regulate domain-specific transcription factors. The mechanisms employed here in an epithelial placode to determine photoreceptor precursors display similarities with the ones previously identified in the adult compound eye, further supporting the notion of a common developmental program for the larval eye and adult compound eye.

"Following infection, virulent mycobacteria persist and grow within the macrophage, suggesting that the intrinsic activation of an innate antimicrobial response is subverted by the intracellular pathogen. For Mycobacterium leprae, the intracellular bacterium that causes leprosy, the addition of exogenous innate or adaptive immune ligands to the infected monocytes/macrophages was required to detect a vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial activity. We investigated whether there is an intrinsic immune response to M. leprae in macrophages that is inhibited by the pathogen. Upon infection of monocytes with M. leprae, there was no upregulation of CYP27B1 nor its enzymatic activity converting the inactive prohormone form of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) to the bioactive form (1,25α-dihydroxyvitamin D). Given that M. leprae-induced type I interferon (IFN) inhibited monocyte activation, we blocked the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), revealing the intrinsic capacity of monocytes to recognize M. leprae and upregulate CYP27B1. Consistent with these in vitro studies, an inverse relationship between expression of CYP27B1 vs. type I IFN downstream gene OAS1 was detected in leprosy patient lesions, leading us to study cytokine-derived macrophages (MΦ) to model cellular responses at the site of disease. Infection of IL-15-derived MΦ, similar to MΦ in lesions from the self-limited form of leprosy, with M. leprae did not inhibit induction of the vitamin D antimicrobial pathway. In contrast, infection of IL-10-derived MΦ, similar to MΦ in lesions from patients with the progressive form of leprosy, resulted in induction of type I IFN and suppression of the vitamin D directed pathway. Importantly, blockade of the type I IFN response in infected IL-10 MΦ decreased M. leprae viability. These results indicate that M. leprae evades the intrinsic capacity of human monocytes/MΦ to activate the vitamin D-mediated antimicrobial pathway via the induction of type I IFN.
","Our macrophages are equipped with the ability to detect and kill invading pathogens, and yet, these cells of the innate immune system are still subject to infection by intracellular bacterium. In particular, mycobacterium, the type of intracellular bacteria responsible for diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy, are very successful at establishing infection within macrophages. By studying Mycobacterium leprae, the etiological agent of leprosy, we describe an immune evasion mechanism whereby this bacterial pathogen utilizes our own antiviral immune response against the macrophage. Type I interferons (IFN) are a major part of our immune response to viral infections; however, this response will also suppress our ability to fight opportunistic bacterial infection. During infection of our macrophages, M. leprae induces an aberrant type I IFN response that subsequently suppresses our macrophage’s ability to activate the vitamin D-mediated antimicrobial pathway, a critical antimicrobial response for containment of mycobacterium. Thus, understanding how these pathogens can evade our immune response will be important for the development of new therapies against these chronic infections.

"In Brazil, tungiasis is endemic in some resource-poor communities where various domestic and sylvatic animals act as reservoirs for this zoonosis. To determine the effect of control measures on the prevalence and intensity of infestation of human and animal tungiasis, a repeated cross-sectional survey with intervention was carried out.
In a traditional fishing community in Northeast Brazil, humans and reservoir animals were treated, and premise-spraying using an insecticide was done, while a second fishing community served as a control. Both communities were followed up 10 times during a 12-month period. At baseline, prevalence of tungiasis was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 35%–51%) and 37% (95% CI: 31%–43%) in control and intervention villages, respectively. During the study, prevalence of tungiasis dropped to 10% (95% CI: 8%–13%; p<0.001) in the intervention village, while the prevalence remained at a high level in the control village. However, after one year, at the end of the study, in both communities the prevalence of the infestation had reached pre-intervention levels. Whereas the intensity of infestation was significantly reduced in the intervention community (p<0.001), and remained low at the end of the study (p<0.001), it did not change in the control village.
Our study shows that a reduction of prevalence and intensity of infestation is possible, but in impoverished communities a long-lasting reduction of disease occurrence can only be achieved by the regular treatment of infested humans, the elimination of animal reservoirs, and, likely, through environmental changes.

","Tungiasis is a disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans, a parasite prevalent in many impoverished communities in developing countries. The female sand flea penetrates into the skin of animals and humans where it grows rapidly in size, feeds on the host's blood, produces eggs which are expelled into the environment, and eventually dies in situ. The lesions become frequently superinfected and the infestation is associated with considerable morbidity. Clearly, tungiasis is a neglected disease of neglected populations. We investigated the impact of a package of intervention measures targeted against on-host and off-host stages of T. penetrans in a fishing community in Northeast Brazil. These measures decreased disease occurrence only temporarily, but had a sustained effect on the intensity of the infestation. Since infestation intensity and morbidity are correlated, presumably the intervention also lowered tungiasis-associated morbidity. Control measures similar to the ones used in this study may help to effectively control tungiasis in impoverished communities.

"Clostridium difficile spore germination is critical for the transmission of disease. C. difficile spores germinate in response to cholic acid derivatives, such as taurocholate (TA), and amino acids, such as glycine or alanine. Although the receptor with which bile acids are recognized (germinant receptor) is known, the amino acid co-germinant receptor has remained elusive. Here, we used EMS mutagenesis to generate mutants with altered requirements for the amino acid co-germinant, similar to the strategy we used previously to identify the bile acid germinant receptor, CspC. Surprisingly, we identified strains that do not require co-germinants, and the mutant spores germinated in response to TA alone. Upon sequencing these mutants, we identified different mutations in yabG. In C. difficile, yabG expression is required for the processing of key germination components to their mature forms (e.g., CspBA to CspB and CspA). A defined yabG mutant exacerbated the EMS mutant phenotype. Building upon this work, we found that small deletions in cspA resulted in spores that germinated in the presence of TA alone without the requirement of a co-germinant. cspA encodes a pseudoprotease that was previously shown to be important for incorporation of the CspC germinant receptor. Herein, our study builds upon the role of CspA during C. difficile spore germination by providing evidence that CspA is important for recognition of co-germinants during C. difficile spore germination. Our work suggests that two pseudoproteases (CspC and CspA) likely function as the C. difficile germinant receptors.
","Germination by C. difficile spores is one of the very first steps in the pathogenesis of this organism. The transition from the metabolically dormant spore form to the actively-growing, toxin-producing vegetative form is initiated by certain host-derived bile acids and amino acid signals. Despite near universal conservation in endospore-forming bacteria of the Ger-type germinant receptors, C. difficile and related organisms do not encode these proteins. In prior work, we identified the C. difficile bile acid germinant receptor as the CspC pseudoprotease. In this manuscript, we implicate the CspA pseudoprotease as the C. difficile co-germinant receptor. C. difficile cspA is encoded as a translational fusion to cspB. The resulting CspBA protein is processed post-translationally by the YabG protease. Inactivation of yabG resulted in strains whose spores no longer responded to amino acids or divalent cations as co-germinants and germinated in response to bile acid alone. Building upon this, we found that small deletions in the cspA portion of cspBA resulted in spores that could germinate in response to bile acids alone. Our results suggest that two pseudoproteases regulate C. difficile spore germination and provide further evidence that C. difficile spore germination proceeds through a novel spore germination pathway.
