A deeper understanding of the interaction between the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is critical for the selection of tumour biomarkers and for the future development of therapies. Human tumour specimens and cell lines contain a plethora of genetic and epigenetic changes, which complicate data analysis. In contrast, mouse tumour models such as the APCMin mouse used in this study arise by a single initiating genetic mutation, yet share key traits with human cancer. Here we show that mouse adenomas acquire a multitude of epigenetic alterations, which are recurring in mouse adenoma and in human colon cancer, representing early and advanced tumours, respectively. The use of a mouse model thus allowed us to uncover a sequence of epigenetic changes occurring in tumours, which may facilitate the identification of novel clinical colon cancer biomarkers.","Aberrant CpG methylation is a universal epigenetic trait in cancer cell genomes. However, human cancer samples from cell lines preclude the investigation of epigenetic changes occurring during early tumour development. Here, we present a list of 13,000 recurring differentially methylated regions (DMRs) characterizing the intestinal adenoma mouse. Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) targets strongly enriched hypermethylated DMRs, PRC2 components of DNA methyltransferases-regulated adenomas. We demonstrate that the DMR signature arises from de novo adenomatous cells and expansion of the pre-existing pattern of intestinal stem cells and undifferentiated crypt cells. We found that epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressors, which occurs frequently in colon cancer, is rare in human colon cancer. Our data provide a global panel of epigenetically modified genes in intestinal tumours."

It is believed that the host immune response and genetic diversity of the parasite play an important role in the progression of Chagas disease, which presents a variety of clinical forms ranging from indeterminate to cardiac and digestive forms. Since parasite genetic diversity may influence the development of Chagas disease, our study aims to understand the immune response of human peripheral blood cells upon infection with two T. cruzi strains with different genetic backgrounds (Col cl1.7 – Tc I, and Y strain – TcII). Our study showed differences in the expression of cytokines and activation molecules between cells infected with strains from Tc I (Col cl1.7) and Tc II (Y strain). These data show the importance of parasite strain in the development of the host response early in infection, which may influence the clinical progression of Chagas disease.","Trypanosoma cruzi strains are currently classified into discrete typing units (DTUs) named TcI and TcII. The three major DTUs are found in patients in northern and southern Latin America, respectively. The hypothesis is that infection of human peripheral blood cells, Y strain (Tc II) and Col cl1.7 (TCI) cause distinct immunological changes, which influence the clinical course of Chagas disease. We evaluated the infectivity of CFSE-stained trypomastigotes of Col cl2 and Y strain in human monocytes at 15 72 hours, and determined the immunological profile of lymphocytes and monocytes exposed to different isolates using multiparameter flow cytometry. Our results showed a similar percentage of intensity of monocyte infection of Y and Y strains, and that infection with Y strain leads to lower monocyte activation and a higher inflammatory profile. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the expression of TNF-alpha and granzyme in the presence of Y strain. These results suggest that the Tc I and CII are distinct in their immunological impact on human cells early infection, and may influence disease progression."

Until now, experiments with genetically disrupted mice have been reported for all but pol ν, encoded by the POLN gene. To intensively analyze the role of mammalian pol ν we generated multiple Poln-deficient murine models. We discovered that Poln is uniquely upregulated during testicular development and that it is enriched in spermatocytes. This, and phylogenetic analysis indicate a testis-specific function. We observed a modest reduction in meiotic recombination at a recombination hotspot in Poln-deficient mice. Pol ν has been suggested to function in DNA crosslink repair. However, we found no increased DNA crosslink sensitivity in Poln-deficient mice or POLN-depleted human cells. This is a major difference from some previous findings, and we support our conclusion by multiple experimental approaches, and by the very low or absent expression of functional pol ν in mammalian somatic cells. The present work represents the first description and comprehensive analysis of mice deficient in pol ν, and the first thorough phenotypic analysis in human cells.","DNA polymerase ν (Pol ν) is a family of DNA polymerases that are expressed in vertebrates and animal lineages. Pol ν–deficient mice have a high relative expression in the testis. We constructed multiple mouse models of Poln disruption and detected anatomic abnormalities, alterations in lifespan, and changed causes of mortality. Mice with inactive Poln were fertile and had normal testis morphology. Inactivation of pol ν in mouse embryonic fibroblasts alters cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C, cisplatin, and aldehydes. Depletion of POLN in human cells alters DNA end-joining and immunoglobulin class- switching, in contrast to animals with defective related DNA polymerase α (pol θ). We examined the response to DNA crosslinking agents, and purified Poln for the ability to bypass the major groove of the peptide adducts and residues of DNA crosslink repair. We found that Poln mutant mice have altered cellular sensitivity and mitomycosis, and that the loss of PolN mutant mice alters the frequency of mitomyci C-induced radial chromosomes. Our results suggest that the function of pol in meiotic homologous recombination processing is not restricted to processing specific substrates."

To rationally design vaccines, antigens and, frequently, adjuvants must be selected to trigger appropriate immune responses against a specific pathogen. We selected dengue-2 envelope protein domain III as a dengue vaccine candidate and expressed this candidate in the lipidated form in an Escherichia coli-based system. Dengue envelope protein domain III mediates binding of the dengue virus to the host cellular receptor. The lipid moiety of the bacterial-derived lipoprotein can activate the innate immune system to elicit an appropriate adaptive immune response. We demonstrated that lipidated dengue-2 envelope protein domain III is more immunogenic than nonlipidated dengue-2 envelope protein domain III. Most importantly, the lipidated dengue-2 envelope protein domain III alone triggered a durable neutralizing antibody response with a low risk of severe side effects. Lipidated subunit vaccines are non-replicating and thus may be less susceptible to replication interference than live attenuated vaccines. Our study suggests that the lipidated subunit vaccine approach could be applied to other serotypes of dengue virus as well as other pathogens.","Dengue virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes severe life-threatening dengue fever, hemorrhagic fever and dengues shock syndrome. However, the existence of serotypes of the virus and its potential to confer protection against denguing virus are not well understood. Recently, a clinical phase 2b trial of Sanofi Pasteur CYD tetravalent dengued vaccine revealed that the vaccine did not confer protection from denguue-2 virus. New approaches for dengengue vaccine development are urgently needed. This approach represents a promising method for the development of a new vaccine that can complement the deficiencies of the CYD dengus vaccine. In this study, we developed a lipidated subunit vaccine that was able to induce higher antibody responses than its nonlipidated counterpart, D2ED III, which did not induce antibody-specific antibody responses. In addition, the avidity neutralizing capacity of antibodies induced by the lipidated vaccine was higher than those elicited by D2ed III and dendritic cells. Importantly, we showed that lipidation, a subunit candidate of LD2EDIII exhibited increased immunogenicity reducing the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement in infection in mice. Our study suggests that lipidated and subunit vaccines can be applied to the serotypes and viruses that are important for vaccine development."

Extracellular factors frequently induce heterogeneous responses, thereby restricting the biological outcome to a fraction of the cell population. However, the question arises how such cell-to-cell variability can be controlled, because some cellular systems show a very homogenous response at a defined level of an extracellular stimulus. We derived an analytical framework to systematically characterize the cell-to-cell variability of intracellular signaling pathways which transduce external signals. We analyzed how heterogeneity arises from fluctuations in the total concentrations of signaling proteins because this is the main source of variability in eukaryotic systems. We find that signaling pathways can be highly variable or inherently invariant, depending on the kinetic parameters and the structural features of the cascade. Our results indicate that the cell-to-cell variability can be reduced by negative feedback in the cascade or by signaling crosstalk between parallel pathways. We precisely define the role of negative feedback loops in variability suppression, and show that different aspects of the dose-response curve can be controlled, depending on the feedback kinetics and site of action in the cascade. This work constitutes a first step towards a systematic understanding of cell-to-cell variability in signal transduction.","Cells reliably sense environmental changes despite internal external fluctuations. However, the mechanisms underlying robustness remain unclear. We analyzed fluctuations in protein concentrations that rise in cell-to-cell variability in protein kinase signaling and analytical theory in numerical simulations. We characterized the dose-response behavior of signaling cascades calculating the stimulus level pathway responds (‘pathway sensitivity’) to maximal activation level of strong stimulation. Minimal kinase cascades are gradual in their response to strong stimulation, while pathway sensitivity to maximal stimulation level is simultaneously invariant. Negative feedback regulation resolves trade-off between fluctuations in pathway sensitivity and maximal activation. Feedbacks acting at different levels of the cascade control different aspects of the dose response curve, synergistically reducing variability. Our results suggest that certain signaling pathways are capable of switch-like decision making, which is inherently robust to protein concentration fluctuations."

We are interested in understanding the immune mechanisms that can control infection. Preliminary studies suggested that CD8+ T cells can kill parasites and limit disease; however, studying these important killer cells has been hindered, because we do not know what parasite molecules they recognize. To overcome this, we engineered parasites to express ovalbumin. Since many tools exist to track and measure immune cells targeted at ovalbumin, we can now track the specific CD8+ T cell responses that develop upon infection with Leishmania. We found that Leishmania initially induced CD8+ T cells to divide and produce molecules such as IFN-gamma that may help them to kill parasites. However, the CD8+ T cells rapidly lost their effector function and died off as infection progressed. More encouragingly, though, we were able to recover some CD8+ T cell function by blocking immune inhibitory molecules that are induced by parasite infection. The recovered T cells killed parasites and controlled infection. These results are important as they could be exploited for the design of new therapeutic vaccine strategies aimed at inducing protective CD8+ T cells.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania donovani parasites. VL is characterized by chronic inflammation and antigen persistence, characterized by the chronic infection of the spleen and CD8+ T cells required for the development of protective immunity. However, antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses in VL have not been studied, in the absence of defined Leishmani-specific epitopes. In this study, we used transgenic Leishmannia and ovalbumin to characterize the development, function, fate and fate of the leishmania-specific cell responses. We found that L. donovan parasites evade the immune response by limiting their expansion and inducing functional exhaustion and cell death. Dysfunctional cells were partially rescued by an in vivo B7-H1 blockade, which significantly reduced the splenic parasite burden. These findings are exploited to design new strategies for immunotherapeutic interventions against VL."

Many aspects of the underlying molecular mechanism still remain elusive. Among the hypotheses that have been put forward in the past few years, it has been suggested that PrP could be destabilized by the protonation of a specific residue, H187, when the protein passes through acidic cell organelles. We have modeled PrP at the atomistic level, with the neutral and protonated forms of H187. Our simulations show that the destabilization process can follow two alternative pathways that could lead to different final structures. This discovery may shed some light on one of the most puzzling aspect of prion diseases, the fact that they exhibit various strains encoded in the structure of misfolded PrP. In addition, the atomistic details provided by our model highlight a key interactions partner in the destabilization process, R136. The  residue pair is not present in non-mammalian species that do not develop prion diseases.","The prion protein (PrP) exhibits dual behavior, possible transition routes, and protonation of H187 at pH 4.5, mimics specific conditions encountered by endosomes. Here, we show that the protonated imidazole ring H187 experiences electrostatic repulsion from nearby guanidinium group R136, which responds by pushing H187 R136 sidechains away from native cavities. The regions of the H187 and R136 linked, C-terminal H2 loop connecting S1 and H1, respectively, are affected in a different manner depending on the pathway taken. Specific in vitro conditions, the presence of molecular chaperones in a particular experimental setup, favor the transition pathway, and result in different   monomers. These results support the observation of fibril morphologies and the outcome of prion strains."

Epilation is a common traditional practice of intermittent plucking of lashes touching the eye, however, its long-term effectiveness in preventing visual impairment is unknown. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of epilation versus eyelid surgery (the main treatment option) in 1300 people with mild trichiasis in Ethiopia. We defined mild trichiasis as fewer than six lashes touching the eye. We have previously reported results to two years and have now re-assessed these individuals at four years. Overall, we found no difference between the epilation and surgery groups in terms of change in vision and corneal opacity between baseline and four years. Most mild trichiasis participants randomised to the epilation arm continued epilating and controlled their trichiasis. This suggests that good quality epilation is a reasonable second-line alternative to surgery for mild trichiasis for individuals who either decline surgery or do not have immediate access to surgical treatment.","Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) needs to be managed to reduce the risk of vision loss. However, the long-term impact of epilation (a common traditional practice of repeated plucking lashes from touching eye) on preventing visual impairment of corneal opacity in TT is unknown. We conducted a randomized controlled trial on epilation versus surgery management in minor TT (with fewer lashes touching the eye) in Ethiopia. We found that epilation had a significant effect on vision in both patients with recurrent TT and those with minor TT. The epilation arm participants were randomly assigned to either high quality epilation forceps or a trained person with good near vision. Participants were examined-monthly-years,-years randomisation, and were offered free surgery. After-year 1151 (88.5%) were examined: 572 (88%) and 579 (89%) epilation surgery arms, respectively.

In recent years there have been significant advances in understanding dengue virus (DV) interactions with target cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells. Interaction with and infection of these cells leads to the production of new virions as well as immune mediators, which can shape the course of the subsequent immune response. The vascular leakage associated with dengue haemorrhagic fever is believed to be immune mediated. Our work on the interaction of DV with human macrophages has led to two major findings; first, we have identified that the macrophage mannose receptor is important for mediating the infection of human macrophages by DV, and second, that the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 enhance macrophage susceptibility to DV infection. DV–receptor interactions are of critical importance for understanding not only the mechanisms of entry, but also the biology of infection and the pathogenesis. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of dengue disease is crucial to the development of both a safe dengue vaccine and therapeutic inhibitors of early DV replication.","Dengue virus (DV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes haemorrhagic fever in humans. To date, little is known about how the MØ mannose receptor (MR) binds to serotypes of DV specifically in the envelope glycoprotein. In this study, we demonstrate that the MR binds to the carbohydrate recognition domains of the mosquito human cell–produced DV antigen and abrogates the deglycosylation of the DV envelope protein. Furthermore, we show that the recombinant MR NIH3T3 cells confers DV binding and blocked anti-MR antibodies. MR is a prototypic marker that is alternatively activated by human monocytes and that pre-treatment with human monocyte M. type 2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) enhances susceptibility to productive DV infection. These findings indicate a new functional role for MR in dengue infection."

These simulations typically investigate spontaneous neural dynamics, in the absence of tasks, sensory input or motor output. Here, we take a different approach, embodying a computational model of spontaneous neural dynamics to control a simulated agent, with sensory input from and motor output to a simulated environment. Embodying the model radically changes how the model operates and changes how we understand the computational mechanisms. We observe interesting brain-environment feedback interactions and observe how different homeostatic systems are needed to compensate for this feedback. We observe this both in the simulated neural dynamics and the behavior of the embodied agent. These findings suggest novel functional roles for homeostatic systems in maintaining neural dynamics and behavior and for the poorly understood default mode network pattern of activity reported in functional neuroimaging in humans and animals.","In recent years, computational simulations of spontaneous neural dynamics have generated interesting brain-environment feedback interactions that rapidly destabilize neural behavioral dynamics demonstrating the need for homeostatic mechanisms. Here, we investigate the roles of homeostasis and plasticity locally (local inhibition adjusting the balance of excitatory input) and globally (regulatory inhibition that compensates for “task positive”, sensory input region) in balancing neural activity leading to stable behavior ( trajectories of the environment). Our results suggest complementary functional roles of local and macroscale mechanisms in maintaining neural behavior and suggest a novel functional role for macroscopic ‘task-negative’ patterns of activity (e.g., default mode network)."

Some long-distance chromosomal interactions play an important role in gene regulation in higher eukaryotic species, such as mouse and human. In budding yeast, gene expression is traditionally thought to be regulated over short distances because the upstream regulatory sequences (URSs) are usually located close to the core promoters. However, recent chromosome conformation capture experiments have detected numerous long-distance chromosomal interactions in the yeast genome. The function of these interactions in gene regulation remains unclear. Here, we developed a new assay to screen for long-distance interactions that affect the activity of a reporter gene. We found three regulatory mechanisms that act from a distance: silencing, transcriptional interference, and 3D clustering, which alter expression level of the reporter gene as well as its cell-to-cell variability. Our results demonstrate that transcription in budding yeast, similar to transcription in higher eukaryotes, can be regulated over long distances. We anticipate our assay can be used as a general platform to screen for functional long-distance chromosomal interactions that affect gene expression.","In eukaryotic cells, there are numerous intra- and inter-chromomal interactions that regulate gene expression. However, the extent of these interactions is not clear. We developed a medium-throughput assay to screen for functional long-distance interactions that affect the average expression level of reporter gene cell-to-cell variability (noise). We found that the MET3 promoter (MET3pr) is flanked by ~1 kb invariable sequences of thousands of genomic loci, allowing contacts between different parts of the genome. Changes in MET3pr activity in a case necessarily involve mechanisms of function at distance. In a case, the locations, which deviate from the norm exhibit distinct patterns including low expression/high noise, low-expression/low noise, high expression/noise, and 3D clustering. We provide evidence that clustering occurs in the native genome and enhances transcription of endogenous Met4-target genes. Overall, our results demonstrate that only a small fraction of long-range chromosomal interactions affect gene expression in yeast."

Reduction by half of chromosome numbers during the first meiotic division depends on genetic exchange, resulting in the formation of crossovers. Without crossovers, pairs of homologous chromosomes frequently fail to separate, resulting in unbalanced gametes with a surplus or deficit of individual chromosomes. Along a given chromosome, crossovers form in different locations in different cells, but distribution of crossovers within each cell is controlled in two ways: first, at least one crossover is formed along each homolog pair, irrespective of size; second, a crossover in a given interval reduces the frequency of crossovers in adjacent chromosome regions. Here, we identify functions of the evolutionarily conserved protein Pch2 in suppressing additional crossovers in adjacent regions and ensuring homolog segregation under certain conditions. Pch2 further controls the assembly of chromosome axis protein Hop1 at future crossover sites. Our findings reveal that chromosome axes undergo structural changes at the same positions where crossovers occur. Thus, axis remodeling and crossover placement are linked via Pch2.","Chromosomes are homologous chromosomes in meiosis that are located at appropriate positions in the chromosomes. Crossover assurance ensures that the crossover homolog pair is positioned correctly, and interference reduces the number of double crossovers. In this study, we investigated the interplay between chromosome axis morphogenesis and non-random crossover placement. We show that chromosome axes are structurally modified at future crossover sites, and that the correspondence between crossover designation marker and Zip3 domains is enriched in the axis ensemble Hop1/Red1. This association is detected at the zygotene stage, and persists at double Holliday junction resolution, and is controlled by a conserved AAA+ ATPase Pch2. In addition, we show that crossover interference appears to superimposed the underlying mechanisms of crossover formation. We also show that the recombination- initiating DSBs are reduced, and Pch 2 is required for viable spore formation, consistent with its functions in chiasma formation."

In order to assist municipalities from temperate areas in Europe in effectively planning vector control programs, we modelled the effect of larviciding in public areas on populations of Aedes albopictus using mosquito collection data from 10 municipalities in Northern Italy, over two years with very different temperature conditions. We then evaluated the resulting probabilities of potential outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue and their expected final sizes, and we compared the intervention costs to the economic and health benefits due to the avoidance of clinical cases. By assessing several different intervention strategies, we found that the optimal timing should be centred on the month of July, corresponding to the period of maximal growth of the mosquito population. Municipality-wide interventions are likely to be cost-effective in small-to-medium towns (below 35,000 inhabitants) even where mosquito infestation is moderate, whereas for larger cities a neighbourhood-based intervention should be considered. The involvement of citizens to apply larvicides within private premises resulted effective but generally too costly.","Aedes albopictus is a mosquito-borne disease that is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. In recent years, several outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue have been reported in European countries. In this study, we assessed the epidemiological effectiveness and economic costs of routine larviciding in European towns in the temperate climate, using a mathematical model of the viral transmission, calibrated by entomological surveillance data collected in municipalities in Northern Italy between 2014 and 2015. We found that routine larvaliding in public catch basins reduces the risk of autochthonous transmission and the size of potential epidemics. We also found that the cost of comprehensive larvicide interventions overcomes potential health benefits related to preventing cases of disease, suggesting adoption of localized interventions."

Different organisms have different assortments of metabolic pathways and input/output requirements, reflecting their adaptation to specific environments, and to specific strategies for reproduction and survival. Here we ask whether, beneath the intricate wiring of these networks, it is possible to discern signatures of optimal (i.e., shortest and maximally efficient) pathway architectures. A systematic search for such optimal pathways between all possible pairs of input and output molecules in real organic chemistry is computationally intractable. However, we can implement such a search in a simple artificial chemistry, which roughly resembles a single atom (e.g., carbon) version of real biochemistry. We find that optimal pathways in our idealized chemistry display a logarithmic dependence of pathway length on input/output molecule size. They also display recurring topologies, including autocatalytic cycles reminiscent of ancient and highly conserved cores of real biochemistry. Finally, across all optimal pathways, we identify universally important metabolites and reactions, as well as a characteristic distribution of reaction utilization. Similar features can be observed in real metabolic networks, suggesting that arithmetic simplicity may lie beneath some aspects of biochemical complexity.","Metabolic networks are fundamental functions of living cells, including energy transduction and the building block of biosynthesis. They are the best characterized networks of living systems, but their evolutionary history and complex wiring constitutes fascinating open questions in biology, intimately related to the enigma of life origin. The evolution of metabolism is subject to general principles, unpredictable accumulation of multiple historical accidents. Here, we apply these principles to applying artificial chemical universe methodologies to study genome scale models of cellular metabolism. In particular, we use metabolic flux constraint-based models to exhaustively search for artificial chemistry pathways that optimally perform an array of elementary metabolic functions. Despite the simplicity of the model employed, we find that the ensuing pathways display a surprisingly rich set of properties, including the existence of autocatalytic cycles in hierarchical modules, the appearance of universally preferable metabolites reactions, and the logarithmic trend of pathway length and function in input/output molecule size. These properties are derived analytically, borrowing methods previously used in cryptography. In addition, by mapping biochemical networks to simplified carbon atom reaction backbone, we show that properties similar to predicted artificial chemistry hold in real metabolic networks. Our findings suggest that optimality principles of arithmetic simplicity lie beneath aspects of biochemical complexity."

Our approach builds upon the previously developed EEMS method, which infers effective migration rates under a dense lattice. Similarly, we infer demographic parameters under a lattice and use a (Voronoi) prior to regularize parameters of the model. However, our method differs from EEMS in a few key respects. First, we use the coalescent model parameterized by migration rates and population sizes while EEMS uses a resistance model. As another key difference, our method uses haplotype data while EEMS uses the average genetic distance. A consequence of using haplotype data is that our method can separately estimate migration rates and population sizes, which in essence is done by using a recombination rate map to calibrate the decay of haplotypes over time. An additional useful feature of haplotype data is that, by varying the lengths analyzed, we can infer demography associated with different recent time periods. We call our method MAPS for estimating Migration And Population-size Surfaces. To illustrate MAPS on real data, we analyze a genome-wide SNP dataset on 2224 individuals of European ancestry.","Genetic diversity is a fundamental feature of genetic diversity that decays geographic distance; however, the relationship is complex, and can vary over time. Methods to visualize these relationships are widespread and can be used in analyses of molecular ecology, conservation genetics, evolutionary genetics, and human genetics. However, few frameworks exist to infer maps of migration rates that vary across geographic space. Here, we present a method to infer migration rates associated with different time periods by counting the number of long segments of haplotype sharing (known as identity-of- descent tracts). We show that this method can reveal time- varying migration rates and population sizes, including changes detectable by a similar method that ignores haplotypic structure. We apply this method to a dataset of contemporary European individuals (POPRES) and provide an integrated analysis of recent population structure growth in ∼3,000 years in Europe."

It is one of the hallmarks of metabolic disease and a consequence of ageing, but insulin resistance is also observed in otherwise healthy individuals after severe trauma/hemorrhage/sepsis, suggesting that it plays a physiological role in modulating the response to injury. Defective insulin signals are linked to impaired wound healing, yet it remains unclear how systemic changes affect locally the cells that coordinate tissue repair. In this study, we used the liver to assess how insulin resistance impacts the injury response in mice. We provide proof of concept that insulin signals are locally integrated by the fibrotic microenvironment surrounding the adult liver stem cells during chronic injury, resulting in the increased expression of epithelial repair signals. Insulin also simultaneously primes stem cells to respond to these stromal growth factors, leading to an increased participation in epithelial repair. Insulin resistance disrupts this local paracrine circuit, resulting in a blunted epithelial response to chronic injury that exacerbates tissue damage. Our model highlights a potential role for insulin in switching the hepatic injury response from a stromal repair process to an epithelial repair process. To our knowledge, our data provide a new perspective from which to reassess how insulin resistance influences fibrosis, wound healing, and tissue remodeling during injury.","Insulin provides important information about tissues’ feeding behavior and energy status. Defective insulin signaling is associated with ageing, tissue dysfunction, and impaired wound healing. In the liver, insulin resistance leads to chronic damage to fibrosis, and it is unclear how tissue-repair mechanisms integrate insulin signals to coordinate the appropriate injury response to affected insulin resistance. In this study, we demonstrate that insulin resistance impairs local cellular crosstalk in the fibrotic stroma of bipotent adult liver progenitor cells (LPCs) and that paracrine interactions promote epithelial repair and tissue remodeling. We show that insulin-resistant mice deficient in insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) show dramatic impairment in proregenerative fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) signaling in stromal niche cells of LPCs and chronic injury. Finally, we provide a detailed account of the role played by IRS2 in promoting Fgf 7 ligand receptor expression in cell compartments, and describe an insulin/IRS2-dependent feed-forward loop capable of sustaining hepatic-epithelialization and driving FGFR2-IIIb expression. Our study provides a compelling insight into the contribution of insulin resistance to pathogenesis of chronic liver disease."

The precise patterning of dendritic arbors is important for the proper functioning of the nervous system, and evidence indicates an involvement of sensory neurons in neuropsychiatric disease such as autism spectrum disorders. The unfolded protein response is a cellular process that ensures and maintains a functional protein-folding environment in the cell’s endoplasmic reticulum, and is compromised in a number of neurodegenerative conditions. Recently, this process has also been implicated in dendrite patterning. We discovered that the function of the unfolded protein response in dendrite patterning is evolutionarily conserved from the roundworm C. elegans to mammals. Specifically, dendrites in both worms and mammals require the function of a conserved enzyme with both kinase and ribonuclease activity, which acts as a sensor for the unfolded protein response. Importantly, we find that loss of this enzyme can be bypassed by reducing the signaling through the insulin-like growth factor receptor. Our findings reveal a new way of bypassing defects in the unfolded protein response during dendrite development.","Neurons receive excitatory sensory inputs from dendrites, which branch extensively to form unique neuron-specific structures. How neurons regulate the formation of a particular arbor is not fully understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified a mutation in the ER stress sensor IRE-1/Irene1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1) that is crucial for proper PVD dendrite arborization in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We found that the evolutionarily conserved role of Ire1 function is dependent on the IRA-1 and Ire1 genes. In addition, mutations in the genes encoding ER stress sensors displayed reduced arbor complexity, whereas mutations in genes encoding the ER-stress sensor were found to be essential for normal PVD arbor development. Our structure and function analyses indicated that Ire-1 nuclease activity is necessary for proper Dendrite morphogenesis, and that mutations in xbp-1, the best-known target for non-canonical splicing of IRE/Ine1, exhibit PVD phenotypes. We also determined that the secretion of distal localization of dendritic DMA-1 by the leucine rich transmembrane receptor (DSM-1) is defective in ire-1 mutants, suggesting a block of the secretory pathway. Interestingly, reducing Insulin/IGF1 signaling and bypassing the key secretory block restore normal targeting of DMA/Irine-1 in the absence of functional IRE–Irene-1."

To sustain catabolism and cellular ATP demand, an appropriate balance between the reduced and oxidized forms of NAD+ must be maintained. Our genome-scale analysis of the transcription factor ArcA provides insight into how this process is transcriptionally regulated in E. coli in the absence of O2. We found that ArcA mediates a previously unrealized comprehensive transcriptional repression of genes encoding proteins associated with oxidation of non-fermentable carbon sources. Through the repression of these pathways, oxidized NAD+ is effectively preserved for fermentation pathways, facilitating energy conservation and preserving a balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of NAD+ in the absence of aerobic respiration. In addition, we found that the majority of ArcA binding sites contain additional sequence elements beyond that required for binding of an ArcA dimer, providing novel insight into how ArcA and other members of the largest class of two component system-response regulators (OmpR/PhoB family) may achieve global regulation of gene expression.","Redox homeostasis is one of the most important aspects of cellular viability, but how cells control redox balance is still poorly understood. Here, we provide a new mechanistic insight into the balance between reduced and oxidized electron carriers at the level of gene expression mapping and the regulon response regulator ArcA in Escherichia coli. We show that ArcA responds to quinone/quinol redox with a membrane-bound sensor kinase, ArcB. Our genome-wide analysis reveals that the ArcA reprograms metabolism under anaerobic conditions and that carbon oxidation pathways recycle redox carriers into respiration and transcriptionally repressed ArcA. We propose that this strategy favors the use of catabolic pathways to recycle the redox carrier into fermentation akin to lactate production in mammalian cells. Unexpectedly, bioinformatic analysis of sequences bound to ArcA ChIP-seq revealed that many ArcA binding sites contain additional direct repeat elements required for binding to the dimer. DNase footprinting assays suggest that non-canonical arrangements between cis-regulatory modules dictate the length of concentration-sensitive occupancy of DNA sites. Our findings suggest that plasticity of ArcA’s binding site architecture provides an efficient means for encoding binding sites to both ArcA and σ70-RNAP transcription factors."

In the present study, we uncovered a novel genetic pathway that may lead to Rb downregulation through RNA splicing mediated by usp39, a gene involved in assembly of the spliceosome. Our forward genetic study in zebrafish suggests that loss of usp39 results in aberrant rb1 mRNA splicing, which likely causes elevated expression of its target e2f4, a key regulator known to have oncogenic activity when overexpressed. We established that e2f4 upregulation is a main factor responsible for the adenohypophyseal cell lineage hyperplasia observed in the zebrafish usp39 mutant. It should be of interest to investigate if mutations or downregulation of USP39 would contribute to pituitary tumorigenesis in humans.","Loss of retinoblastoma (Rb) is a tumor suppressor that is associated with human malignancies.

In this study, we examined the contribution of host immune responses induced by CMV infection to abnormal development of the CNS by treating neonatal mice infected with MCMV with glucocorticoids. We found that glucocorticoid treatment of infected mice decreased the inflammatory response within the CNS without altering the level of virus replication. In addition, abnormalities in the structure of the cerebellum, as well as abnormalities in granule neuron precursor cell proliferation were normalized in MCMV infected mice following glucocorticoid treatment. These studies suggest that the host immune response to CMV infection is damaging to the developing CNS and that it may be possible to limit CNS disease by modulating inflammation. Moreover, understanding how inflammation and the immune response may alter the developmental program within the CNS could offer important insight into the mechanisms of disease leading to abnormal brain development following intrauterine infection.","Infection with the developing fetus of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major cause of central nervous system disease in infants and children.

Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) are among the most common bacterial causes of diarrhea, accounting for an estimated 300,000–500,000 deaths each year, mostly in young children. There unfortunately is not yet a vaccine that can offer sustained, broad-based protection against ETEC. While most vaccine development effort has focused on plasmid-encoded finger-like ETEC adhesin structures known as colonization factors, additional effort is needed to identify conserved target antigens. Epidemiologic studies suggest that immune responses to uncharacterized, chromosomally encoded antigens could contribute to protection resulting from repeated infections. Earlier studies of immune responses to ETEC infection had identified a class of surface-expressed molecules known as autotransporters (AT). Therefore, available ETEC genome sequences were examined to identify conserved ETEC autotransporters not shared by the commensal E. coli HS strain, followed by studies of the immune response to these antigens, and tests of their utility as vaccine components. Two chromosomally encoded ATs, identified in ETEC, but not in HS, were found to be immunogenic and protective in an animal model, suggesting that conserved AT molecules contribute to protective immune responses that follow natural ETEC infection and offering new potential targets for vaccines.","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major diarrheal pathogen in developing countries, which accounts for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. To develop a vaccine that would prevent the disease caused by ETEC, an extensive effort is needed to identify conserved antigenic targets. Pathogenic pathogens use the autotransporter (AT) secretion mechanism to export virulence factors. These proteins are comprised of a highly conserved carboxy terminal outer membrane and a beta barrel surface-exposed amino terminal passenger domain. Recent immunoproteomic studies suggesting multiple autotrins and passenger domains were recognized following ETEC infection prompted present studies. Using the available ETEC genomes, we were able to identify the coding sequences of two pathogenic isolates, commensal and E. coli HS strain. The passenger domains corresponding to autotreporters were cloned and expressed recombinant antigens, suggesting that these proteins expressed in experimental naturally occurring ETEC infections may be immunogenic.

In 2011–2017, the incidence steadily increased 19 (23.8%) from 80 cases clustered in Eid Al Adha. The median age was 33 (15–68) years and 79 (90%) male. The major risk of infection was contact with animals, or butchering 73/88 (83%) case related to tick bites. Severe cases-represented: 64 (72.7%) platelet count <50 x 109/L 32 (36.4%) died. The intrafamilial spread of healthcare-associated infection was a major concern in this country. Preventive measures should be introduced to reduce the risks of transmission to animal handlers and butchers and maintain safety in healthcare settings."

Although the balance is often perturbed by environmental changes, mutations, and noise in biochemical reactions, cellular systems can maintain their function despite these perturbations. This property of cells, called robustness, is now considered to be a design principle of biological systems and has become a central theme for systems biology. We previously developed an experimental method designated “genetic tug-of-war,” in which we assessed the robustness of cellular systems upon overexpression of certain genes, especially that of the budding yeast cell cycle. Although the yeast cell cycle can be maintained despite significant overexpression of most genes within the system, the cell cycle halts upon just two-fold overexpression of M phase phosphatase CDC14. In this study, we experimentally showed that this fragility is caused by dosage imbalance between CDC14 and NET1. Interestingly, fragility of regulation of separase gene ESP1, potentially caused by dosage imbalance, was masked by regulation of other factors such as CDH1 and CLB2. We thus propose that dosage imbalance causes fragility in biological systems.","Cells maintain their functions despite fluctuations in intracellular parameters, such as protein activities and gene expression levels. The most commonly observed biological property of cells is called robustness. On the other hand, parameters have different limitations, reflecting the property of the subsystem containing the parameter. In the budding yeast cell cycle, fragile overexpression of CDC14, robustly overexpressed ESP1 causes fragility. In this study, we used a mathematical model to predict the extreme fragility of the cell cycle caused by dosage imbalance of genes. We experimentally showed that dosage imbalance caused by the genetic interactions between genes performing combinatorial “gen tug-of-war” experiments showed experimental evidence of dosage imbalance in CDC14 and ESP1. We also showed that fragility arising from dosage imbalance between ESP1 and PDS1 masked CDH1 and CLB2. The masking function of CLB1 was masked by the stabilization of Pds1 phosphorylation. Finally, we modified the Chen model according to our findings."

Extensive studies have revealed that the dysregulation of STAT6 is linked to the pathological features of virus-associated cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of STAT6 regulation by tumor viruses is still unknown. Here, we report that the degradation of STAT6 is induced and required for the lytic activation of human herpesviruses including oncogenic γ-herpesviruses (KSHV and EBV) and α/β-herpesviruses (HSV1 and HCMV). Importantly, this effect is highly dependent on the expression of viral lytic antigens (i.e., RTA in KSHV). This study reveals the central role of STAT6 in controlling the switch from latency to lytic replication of herpesviruses.","The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus that is responsible for the development of multiple cancer types. In this study, we show that RTA, a master regulator of lytic replication, interacts with STAT6 to promote lysine 48 (K48) and K63-linked ubiquitylation and STAT6 degradation in proteasome and lysosome systems. We show that degradation of STAT6 dramatically associated with increased ubiquitylated form of the tripartite motif family like 2 (TRIML2, tumor suppressor) and prolonged cell survival and virion production, which is commonly observed during lytic activation of Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus. Our results suggest that degradation by STAT6 is an important lytic activator of KSHV, an attractive therapeutic target."

Through this serological survey, we present data on the magnitude (measured in proportions) of seroprevalence and seroconversion within 12 selected wards in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. In 2012 the observed dengue seroprevalence was 93% among individuals tested during post-monsoon with a seroconversion rate between pre- and post-monsoon periods of 57.7%. This finding suggests that dengue virus (DENV) circulated in the city during the observation period. Past exposure to dengue virus was highly associated with age, possession of indoor potted plants, types of mosquito control measures used, and human movement and attendance in mass gatherings, while the extent of dengue seroprevalence were not associated with the socioeconomic status of the study participants. Our findings suggest that household utilities and water management or storage practices and recognition and elimination of mosquito development sites and participation in mass gatherings are important factors that affect exposure to dengue. Intervention strategies should therefore target these factors for effective prevention and control of dengue infection.","Dengue virus (DENV) has been reported in Dhaka, Bangladesh since the early 1960s. The greatest burden of dengue fever and dengu hemorrhagic fever cases were observed between 2000 and 2000. At the time, the intensity and intensity of the disease varied year year, and determining factors remained relatively unknown. Due to light gaps in knowledge, the main objectives of this study were to determine the magnitude and seroprevalence of seroconversion among the surveyed population, establish individual/familial level risk factors, and establish the age groups and risk factors for DENV seropositivity among the target populations in city Dhaka. We conducted a prospective cohort study involving serological surveys and blood donation in the city of Dhaka in 2012. The study participants were recruited from 12 90 wards and blood samples were collected in the pre-monsoon (n = 1125) and post-Monsoon (N = 600) seasons of 2012. Serological analysis revealed that DENV strains and flaviviruses were circulating in the population during the study period, and that age, possession of indoor potted plants, and types of mosquito control measures were significant factors associated with DENV infection. These findings suggest that an intense circulation of DENV in 2012 resulted in significant risk of viral associated illness."

C. difficile transmission is mediated by contamination of gut by spores. Understanding how this complex developmental process is regulated is fundamental to decipher the C. difficile transmission and pathogenesis. A less tight connection between the forespore and mother cell lines of gene expression is observed in C. difficile compared to Bacillus subtilis especially at the level of the late sigma factor, σK. In C. difficile, the sigK gene is interrupted in most of the strains by a prophage-like intervening sequence, skinCd, which is excised during sporulation. Contrary to B. subtilis, CD1231 encoding the large serine recombinase required for skinCd excision, is constitutively expressed and a recombination directionality factor, whose synthesis is detected only in the mother cell, restricts skinCd excision to this terminal cell. These two proteins are necessary and sufficient to trigger skinCd excision promoting the timely appearance of σK, which in turn switches-on late sporulation events. While several strains of C. difficile lack a skin element, we show that deletion of skinCd results in premature σK activity and in spores with altered surface layers, a property that might be important for host colonization.","Clostridium difficile is an anaerobe that causes nosocomial diarrhea in humans and animals. It is a major cause of respiratory infections in humans due to the lack of oxygen-resistant spores that form a central role in the infectious cycle. The late stages of sporulation require the mother cell regulatory protein σK. In Bacillus subtilis, the onset of σk activity requires excision of the prophage-like element (skinBs) inserted into the sigK gene by proteolytical removal of the inhibitory pro-sequence. Importantly, this rearrangement is restricted to mother cell skinBs by a recombinase produced specifically in the cell. In C. difficiles, the skinCd gene CD1231 shares a similarity with large serine recombinases and is required for sporulation. However, the recombination directionality factor CD1234 is not required for skinCcd excision. Therefore, we show that skinCD excision does not control the expression of the host cell regulatory proteins σE and SpoIIID. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the absence of the skincd gene is a key element controlling the onset and activity of the sporulation and fidelity of spore development."

In particular, shotgun metagenomics provide data at unprecedented species- and strain- levels of resolution. Several large-scale metagenomic disease-associated datasets are also becoming available, and disease-predictive models built on metagenomic signatures have been proposed. However, the generalization of resulting prediction models on different cohorts and diseases has not been validated. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of microbiome-phenotype associations.

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*5701 is the host factor most strongly associated with slow HIV-1 disease progression. However, the risk of progression to AIDS also varies among patients carrying this specific allele. To gain a better understanding of the interplay between HIV-1 evolutionary rate variation and risk of disease progression, we followed untreated HLA-B*5701 subjects from early infection up to the onset of AIDS. The analysis of longitudinal viral sequences with advanced computational biology techniques based on coalescent Bayesian methods showed a highly significant association between lower synonymous substitution rates and higher baseline CD4+ T cell counts in HLA-B*5701 subjects. The finding provides a potential model to explain differences in risk of disease progression among individuals carrying this allele and might have translational impact on clinical practice, since synonymous rates, which are proportional to in vivo viral replication rates, could be used as a novel evolutionary marker of disease progression.","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is a major cause of AIDS in the developing world.

We found that the rate of viral evolution was significantly lower among subjects with high-risk progressors (HRPs) and low-risk progressionors (LRPs). We also observed that the viral population infecting LRPs was characterized by a slower increase in synonymous divergence over time. This pattern was explained by differences in subjects’ T cell activation and selection pressure.

Although the numbers of infected humans have decreased continuously during the last decades, emerging resistance and adverse side effects against commonly used drugs require an urgent need for the identification of novel drug targets and the development of new drugs. Using an unbiased genome-wide screen to search for genes involved in the mode of action of trypanocidal compounds, we identified a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, TbMCP14, as prime candidate to mediate the action of a group of anti-parasitic choline analogs against T. brucei. Ablation of TbMCP14 expression by RNA interference or gene deletion decreases the susceptibility of parasites towards the compounds while over-expression of the carrier shows the opposite effect. In addition, down-regulation of TbMCP14 protects mitochondria from drug-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces proline-dependent ATP production. Together, the results demonstrate that TbMCP14 is involved in energy production in T. brucei, possibly by acting as a mitochondrial proline carrier, and reveal TbMCP14 as candidate protein for drug action or targeting.","Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes a wide range of diseases, including malaria, typhoid fever, and diabetes.

Depletion of TbmCP14 inducible in the bloodstream and procyclic forms increased resistance to these compounds 7-fold and 3-fold, respectively, compared to uninduced cells. In addition, the loss of the TbMP14 in-regulation of the bloodstream form of mitochondria resulted in a drug-induced decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, the depletion of the parasite-expressing procytic forms increased parasite susceptibility by 13-fold. Metabolomic analyses of parasites-expressed TbMsCP14 showed increased levels of the proline metabolite, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, suggesting a possible involvement of T.bMcp14 in energy production.

Currently, 140 out of approximately 800 GPCRs are referred to as orphan because of a lack of knowledge about their endogenous ligands, and they attract great interest in major medical institutes and pharmaceutical companies. Can a “ligand-receptor” model apply to all the GPCRs? Our study shows that it probably cannot.

Protein structure analysis and experiment data also suggest that placental mammalian BRS3, including human BRS3, lost connection with its original ligands during placental mammalian evolution. Therefore, we propose a new point of view that a considerable number of orphan GPCRs do not have endogenous ligands and might represent a new group of GPCRs that are genuinely orphan GPCRs and will never be deorphanized by discovery of a natural ligand.

We present evidence for this exchange for isoprenoids, abundant lipidic compounds essential to many cellular processes including signaling, trafficking, energy metabolism, and protein translation. Our work shows that intracellular T. gondii tachyzoites are able to salvage farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and/or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from the host, and the parasite is able to grow even when its endogenous production is shut down. However, when extracellular, the parasite depends entirely on its own production of isoprenoids.

Our comparative genome analyses have highlighted the role of pathoadaptive changes in virulence associated genes, such as those encoding for effectors, in shaping the underlying differences in virulence spectra among the three species, and also revealed that changes in the size of gene families associated with nutrient acquisition and assimilation are more respectful of the species virulence profiles rather than their evolutionary relationships. Thus, we posit that next to species-specific evolutionary adaptations in virulence-associated genes, the increase in virulence of P. eumusae and P. fijiensis has been driven by convergent evolution in metabolic pathways that likely facilitate a higher efficiency of nutrient acquisition, uptake, and utilization.","Sigatoka disease is a disease caused by three closely-related Dothideomycete fungi, Pseudocercospora musae (yellow sigatoka) and P. fijiensis (eumusae leaf spot). The two species emerged from a recent common ancestor, with clear differences in virulence, but P. eumusai and the fijienis are considered aggressive. In order to understand the genomic modifications associated with shifts in species virulence spectra and speciation, we sequenced the genomes of the three species and compared the available genome sequence of P. musae and the available genomes of both species. Comparative analysis of genome architectures revealed significant differences in genome size, mainly due to different rates of LTR retrotransposon proliferation and proliferation. However, gene counts remained relatively equal in the range of Dothidesomycetes. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on a set of 46 conserved single-copy genes strongly supported earlier evolutionary radiation between P. spp. and p. musa, suggesting that the two species share complementary patterns of expansions and contractions of core gene families related to metabolism and enzymatic degradation of plant cell walls, suggesting convergent changes in metabolic pathways associated with nutrient acquisition and assimilation. Finally, we identified 234 gene families, including seven putative effectors, exclusively present in Sigatoka species, related to adaptation to the banana host."

However, the mechanisms that result in these clinical outcomes after infection are poorly understood. In this study, we applied a data-driven approach to obtain insights into the immunological processes linked to the progression of the disease or to protective mechanisms. For this purpose, we evaluated the patterns of expression for genes that code proteins from the entire human genome in the peripheral blood from patients with visceral leishmaniasis, from individuals who remained asymptomatic after infections with L. infantum, from patients who were recovering from disease after treatment and from uninfected individuals. By employing computational analysis to evaluate the blood transcriptional activity of each group, we identified transcriptional signatures that correlate with previous findings obtained through different analytical methods. Moreover, our analyses uncovered hitherto unidentified molecular pathways and gene networks associated with the transcriptional profiles of individuals recovering from disease or that did not develop symptoms after infection. This suggests that activation of protective responses can be useful targets for the development of new therapies for visceral leishmaniasis.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease caused by the bacterium Leishmania infantum. The disease is lethal if untreated; however, the majority of human infections are asymptomatic. Using Illumina Bead Chip microarray technology, we investigated the expression patterns of gene expression in blood of active VL patients, asympomatic infected individuals, and patients with remission of VL controls. Computational analyses based on differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, weighted gene co-expression networks and cell deconvolution generated data demonstrating discriminative transcriptional signatures. We found that patients with VL exhibited heterogeneous transcriptional profiles associated with pathways of gene modules, reflecting activation of T lymphocytes and MHC class type interferon signaling, and overall regulation of pathways and gene modules related to monocytes and neutrophils. Patients with remission and VL presented heterogeneous gene expression profiles, which correlated with activation of the Notch signaling pathway gene modules and reflected increased proportions of B cells in treatment of the disease. Asymptomically uninfected individuals presented similar gene expression profile, however, in asymmptomatic individuals, they exhibited particularities that suggest efficient regulation of lymphocyte activation and a strong association with type interfon response. These findings demonstrate the robustness of expression data acquired from microarray analysis."

This conflict of interest among cooperating individuals can lead to the evolution of complex social strategies that depend on the identity (e.g. genotype or strategy) of the individuals with whom you interact. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum provides a compelling model for studying such “partner specific” conflict and cooperation. Upon starvation, free-living amoebae aggregate and form a fruiting body composed of dead stalk cells and hardy spores. Different genotypes will aggregate to produce chimeric fruiting bodies, resulting in potential social conflict over who will contribute to the reproductive sporehead and who will “sacrifice” themselves to produce the dead stalk. The outcomes of competitive interactions in chimera appear complex, with social success being strongly partner specific. Here we propose a simple mechanism to explain social strategies in D. discoideum, based on the production of and response to stalk-inducing factors, the social signals that determine whether cells become stalk or spore. Indeed, measurements of signal production and response can predict social behavior of different strains, thus demonstrating a novel and elegantly simple underlying mechanistic basis for natural variation in complex facultative social strategies. This suggests that simple social rules can be sufficient to generate a diverse array of behavioral outcomes that appear complex and unpredictable when those rules are unknown.","The evolution of cooperative behavior is a paradox of natural selection that favor exploitative individuals to avoid paying their fair share of costs. The conflict between self-interest and cooperating individuals results in evolution of complex, opponent-specific, social strategies that counterstrategies. However, the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying complex social strategies, such as evolution of cooperation and cooperative behavior, are largely unknown. To address this dearth of empirical data, we combine mathematical modeling, molecular genetic, and developmental approaches to test whether variation in the production of response to social signals is sufficient to generate complex social success seen in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. We find that simple measurements of the production response of social signals generate the sort of apparent complex changes in social behavior seen in this system, which need partner recognition. Secondly, measurements of signal production in response to a mutant change in a single gene leads to a shift in social behaviors, which provides a support model for our model. Finally, we demonstrate a novel elegantly simple underlying mechanistic basis for natural variation in complex social behaviors in D. discoideums."

Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that mRNAs encoding SMPs (mSMPs) are also enriched on the ER, yet how they target this organelle is less clear. The signal recognition particle (SRP), which recognizes N-terminal hydrophobic signals of nascent polypeptides and targets them to an ER-localized receptor, was proposed to mediate the co-translational ER targeting of mRNA. However, more recent studies show that SRP inactivation, as well as the inhibition of translation, do not prevent targeting. Thus, how mSMPs reach the ER and whether the process is translation-independent remain open. Here we identify a cis-acting sequence element in mSMPs that appears to facilitate mRNA stability and localization to the ER and, more importantly, enhances protein secretion. This motif, entitled “SECReTE” (secretion-enhancing cis regulatory targeting element) is enriched in nearly all mSMPs in eukaryotes and its addition or removal from mRNAs results in either enhanced or reduced protein secretion, respectively. Thus, SECReTE is a RNA sequence motif that regulates protein translation and secretion.","The localization of secreted/membrane proteins (mSMPs) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a mechanism that facilitates co-translational translocation of these secreted proteins. However, the mechanism of mSMP recruitment in the ER in eukaryotes remains largely unknown. Here, we identify a cis-acting RNA sequence motif that enhances mRTE localization in ER and appears to increase mRNA stability, synthesis, and secretion of secretome proteins. We have identified SECReTE, a secretion-enhancing cis regulatory targeting element, as a novel RNA motif enriched in mRNAs encoding secreted and membrane proteins translated into the ER by the inner membrane of prokaryotes. We show that the SECRETE motif consists of ≥10 nucleotide triplet repeats enriched in pyrimidine (C/U) base (i.e. NNY, N = nucleotide, Y = pyridine) and present in untranslated coding regions of mRNA. Synonymous mutations elevate SECRTE count given mRNA (e.g. SUC2, HSP150, CCW12) and lead to increased protein secretion in yeast cells. In addition, the addition of the SECreTE 3’UTR mRNA to an exogenously expressed protein (E.g., GFP) led to increased secretion of the secreted protein. Thus, our work provides a novel mechanism by which the mRNA localization of mRMPs in ER is facilitated by mRNA translation and protein secretion."

The evidence suggests that the first invasion event likely occurred some years before its initial detection in 2013, despite California’s extensive and active surveillance program, implying that this invasive mosquito can go undetected.

Recent advances in DNA sequencing have made it possible to use computational and statistical methods to examine the interplay between evolution and genomic composition. We wished to see whether particular properties could be extracted that would provide clues on how prokaryotic DNA is composed. For instance, we wondered whether or not protein coding regions carried a greater information potential than non-coding regions, if there is a link between genome size and GC content, whether GC content is different in coding and non-coding regions, and possible associations between DNA composition and environment. Our results indicated that genomic nucleotide frequencies are a determinant of many DNA compositional properties, but also that other influences are at work. For instance, bacteria are known to frequently exchange DNA with the environment and other organisms. Acquired DNA can therefore have different compositional properties than host DNA, and since pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance in bacteria is often associated with foreign DNA, advancing the knowledge of DNA composition is of great importance.","Oligonucleotide usage in archaeal bacterial genomes is linked to a number of properties, including codon usage, DNA base- stacking energy (dinucleotides), DNA structural conformation, and di- tetranucleotide usage. We wanted to assess the statistical information potential of different DNA ‘word- sizes’ to explore how oligonucleototide frequencies differ between coding and non-coding regions. We found that the DNA composition and DNA sequence patterns change in prokaryotic organisms. We also found that oligonotide frequencies are predominantly short range correlated, i.e. the information about the genome is encoded in the short-range of oligonotides. Oligonotide usage varied in both GC-rich and free-living genomes, but variation was mainly located in non-cytoplasmic regions. Bias (selectional pressure) in tetranotide usage correlated with GC content, coding regions were biased towards non-Coding regions, and non coding regions. Pronounced DNA compositional differences were found in the non-rich genomes and were similar to those found in GC-poor genomes. These differences are possibly attributed to lifestyle, tetranole usage in host-associated bacteria, and are dissimilar to those in biased free-forming archaea bacteria."

And this ectopic local gene dysregulation occurred at high frequency in regions of high gene density. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating the local effects on gene regulation following spontaneous insertions and deletions, and after engineering mutations, in mammalian systems.

In addition to transcriptional regulation, a sequence motif located in the 3′ UTR (D3U-box) mediates transcript stability of dmrt1 mRNAs. However, this regulation is complex, and the mechanisms are barely understood. Here, we analyse further dmrt1 regulation in the fish model medaka and show that two RNA-binding proteins with antagonizing properties target the D3U-box and promote either RNA stabilization in germ cells or degradation in the soma. The evolutionary conservation of the D3U-box motif within metazoan dmrt1 genes—together with preserved expression patterns of the targeting RNA binding proteins in subsets of germ cells—suggest that this new mechanism for controlling RNA stability is not restricted to fishes but might also apply to other vertebrates.","Dmrt1 is a highly conserved transcription factor, critically involved in the regulation of gonad development in vertebrates.

The egg is the least known life stage and understanding it can contribute with novel strategies for mosquito control. Mosquitoes lay eggs in water collections, some of which are temporary. At early embryogenesis eggs are prone to lose water, leading to dehydration and death. During embryogenesis the serosal cuticle is produced, it wraps the embryo and contributes to the egg protection, allowing it to survive outside the water. Curiously, this resistance varies among mosquitoes: Aedes, Anopheles and Culex eggs can survive outside the water for long, intermediate and short periods, respectively. Here, we show that these differences are related to the degree of eggshell melanization (melanin is a dark pigment): darker eggs resists more against water loss. We confirmed that melanin increases survival outside the water employing a mosquito mutant that does not melanize properly. The protection conferred by melanin is dependent on the formation of the serosal cuticle. Our results contribute to the study of the evolution of egg coloration in insects and we identified one of the reasons why Aedes aegypti eggs survive for several months outside water.","Mosquito vectors lay white eggs in aquatic milieu. During early embryogenesis, water passes freely through the transparent eggshell, which is composed of the exochorion and endochorions. After hours of endochoration, the egg darkens and the melanization eggs shrink and perish when removed from the moisture. However, mid-embryonic serosa secrete a serosal cuticle, localized to the innermost eggshell layer, which greatly reduces water flow and allows egg survival outside water. The degree of egg resistance to desiccation (ERD) in late embryogenesis varies between different species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles aquasalis and Culex quinquefasciatus eggs survive in a dry environment ≥ 72, 24, and 5 hours, respectively. In adult insects, darker-body individuals have greater resistance to ERD than lighter ones. We asked whether egg melanization enhances mosquito serosal and cuticle-dependent ERD. We found that adult mosquitoes with lower ERD in late embryoogenesis exhibit melanized eggshells. This melanization-ERD hypothesis was confirmed by employing two An. quadrimaculatus strains, wild type mutant GORO and dark-brown golden eggshell. In both cases, serosal or cuticle formation is fundamental for the establishment of efficient ERD and egg viability outside water in higher mosquitoes than those with darker or lighter eggs. This finding is relevant to understand the evolutionary history of insect egg coloration. The eggshell and adult cuticle pigmentation should be considered as novel approaches for vector pest insects control."

Compared to control animals exposed to virus alone, monkeys with schistosomiasis required exposure to 17-fold lower levels of virus to become infected. The schistosome-infected monkeys also had significantly higher levels of initial virus replication and loss of a certain subset of memory T cells, both predictors of a more rapid progression to immune dysfunction. These results suggest that worm infections may increase the risk of becoming infected with HIV-1 among individuals with viral exposures. Furthermore, they support the idea that control programs for schistosomiasis and perhaps other parasitic worm infections may also be useful in helping to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in developing countries where helminths are endemic.","HIV-1 infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa represent 10% of the world population and 2/3 of the HIV-1/AIDS cases. However, the disproportionate prevalence of helminthic parasite infections in the region has not been prospectively tested in a relevant in vivo model. We measured the pre-existing infection of rhesus monkeys with a parasitic worm, Schistosoma mansoni, and challenged intrarectally decreasing doses of the R5-tropic clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C). Systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys but the viral doses remained sub-infected in normal hosts. In fact, 50% of animal infectious (AID50) was 17-fold lower than parasitized animals compared to controls (P<0.001). Coinfected animals had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads than controls, and increased viral replication of CD4+ central memory cells (P = 0.03). Our data provide direct evidence that acute schistosomiasis significantly increases the risk of de novo AIDS virus acquisition, and the magnitude of this effect suggests that control of parasitic worm infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV."

However, irregular somites are still formed, suggesting that the clock is not required for somite formation itself but rather endows it with developmental reproducibility. Thus, the following questions arose: How do irregular somites emerge in a clock-independent manner? How is the irregularity reduced in the presence of the clock? To address these questions, we developed a computational model of somitogenesis. We then clarified that the intrinsic noise induces spontaneous formation of irregular-sized somites in the absence of the clock, and that the clock plays an important role in suppressing the noise effect for reproducible somite formation.","During embryonic development, somites are repeatedly reproduced in a single embryo. However, the effect of noise on developmental reproducibility is not fully investigated. In this study, we developed a computational model of ERK-mediated somitogenesis, which is regulated by the FGF gradient, cell-cell communication, and segmentation clock, subject to intrinsic noise. Our model simulation generated previous in vivo observation showed that ERK activity is distributed along a step-like gradient in the presomitic mesoderm, and the boundary posteriorly shifted in a clock stepwise manner, leading to regular somite formation. Removing the clock model predicted that the stepwise shift in activity occurs at an irregular timing and irregular distance owing to noise, resulting in somite size variation. This model prediction was recently confirmed by live imaging of the EK activity in zebrafish embryos. Our theoretical analysis provides a novel mechanism by which the clock reduces the inherent somite irregularity observed in clock-deficient embryos."

Proteins such as hemoglobin or chaperonin GroEL are oligomers formed by 2 and 14 subunits, respectively, whereas virus capsids are multimers composed of hundreds of monomers. In these cases, the architecture of the interface between the subunits and the overall assembly geometry are essential in determining the functional motions that these sophisticated structures are able to perform under physiological conditions. Here we present results from our computational study of the large-amplitude motions of dimeric and hexameric proteins that belong to the Amino Acid Kinase family. Our study reveals that the monomers in these oligomeric proteins are arranged in such a way that the oligomer inherits the intrinsic dynamic features of its components. The packing geometry additionally confers the ability to perform highly cooperative conformational changes that involve all monomers and enable the biological activity of the multimer. The study highlights the significance of the quaternary design in favoring the oligomer dynamics that enables ligand-binding and allosteric regulation functions.","Oligomerization is a functional requirement for many proteins. The interfacial interactions between the overall packing geometry of individual monomers are viewed as important determinants of thermodynamic stability and allosteric regulation of oligomers. In this study, we show that oligomerization stiffens the overall contact topology and dynamic features acquired from the oligomeric state. We also show that the softest collective motions (i.e., the lowest frequency global modes of motions) are favored overall architecture. Notably, the lowest-frequency modes accessible to individual subunits in absence of multimerization are conserved in a large extent in oligomer, suggesting oligomer takes advantage of intrinsic dynamics of the individual monomer to exploit rigid-body translational and rotational degrees of freedom of intact monomers. Our present study sheds light on the mechanism of cooperative inhibition of hexameric N-acetyl-L- glutamate kinase and arginine allostic regulation by UMP kinases."

Over 99% of these deaths occur in developing countries, predominantly in Asia and in Africa where rabies is endemic in domestic dogs. Despite the global health burden due to rabies, little is known about the patterns of the spread of dog rabies in these endemic regions. We used recently developed Bayesian analytical methods to unravel the dynamics and determinants of the spatial diffusion of dog rabies viruses in North Africa based on viral genetic data. Our analysis reveals a combination of restricted spread across administrative borders, the occasional long-distance movement of rabies viruses, and a strong fit between spatial spread of the virus and road distances between localities. Together, these data indicate that by transporting dogs, humans have played a key role in the dispersal of a major animal pathogen. Our studies therefore provide essential new information on the transmission dynamics of rabies in Africa, and in doing so will greatly assist in future intervention strategies.","Rabies virus (RABV) is one of the most prevalent human-borne diseases in North Africa. In this study, we used Bayesian phylogeographic methods to unravel the dynamics and determinants of the spread of dog rabies virus (RABV) in North African countries. We found that the countries studied exhibited largely disconnected spatial dynamics, with major geo-political boundaries acting as barriers to gene flow. Road distances proved to be better predictors of movement of RABV from raw geographical distance than the occasional long distance rapid spread of the virus. Our simulations bridge phylodynamics and spatial epidemiology, and demonstrate that the contemporary viral distribution extends beyond expected human-mediated dispersal. Our results demonstrate that viral genetic data can be a powerful asset characterizing, predicting, and potentially controlling the spatial spread of pathogens."

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) with its capability of burning off fat to generate heat is now at the center of research interest as target of therapeutic intervention for obesity treatment. In order to get a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and transcriptional programs underlying brown adipocyte differentiation, we profiled the epigenomic and transcriptomic changes during brown adipogenesis and performed a comparative analysis against white adipogenesis using bioinformatic tools. We identified several novel factors involved in brown adipocyte differentiation and showed that the kinase PIM1 and the transcription factors SIX1, SOX13 and RREB1 positively regulate differentiation. Finally we also provide a genome-wide map of SIX1 binding in mature brown adipocytes.","Brown adipocyte recruitment is a promising approach to combat obesity. Here, we report a comprehensive profiling of the epigenome of lineage commitment in the C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cell line of brown adipocytes.

Serological tests have long been established as rapid, simple and inexpensive tools for the diagnosis and follow-up of PCM. However, different protocols and reagents are used. We compared here the performance of six Brazilian reference centers for serological diagnosis of PCM. Each center provided 30 sera of PCM patients, with positive high, intermediate and low titers, which were defined as the “reference” titers. Each center then applied its serological routine test to the 150 sera from the other five centers blindly as regards to the “reference” titers. Surprisingly, all centers exhibited a high rate of discordances (mean of 31 discordant scores in 150 sera tested). When the scores given by one center to their own sera were compared with the scores given to their sera by the other centers, a high rate of major discordances was found (a mean of 14.8 sera in 30 presented a discordance with at least one other center). We concluded that there are inconsistencies among the laboratories that can potentially result in conflicting information regarding the patient's treatment.

In resource-poor settings, CLM is associated with considerable morbidity. The disease is caused by animal hookworm larvae that penetrate the skin and migrate aimlessly in the epidermis as they cannot penetrate the basal membrane. Particularly in the rainy season, the intensity of infection is high with up to 40 larval tracks in an affected individual. Tracks are very itchy and are surrounded by a significant inflammation of the skin. Bacterial superinfection is common and intensifies the inflammation. The psychosocial consequences caused by CLM have never been investigated. We showed that CLM causes skin disease-associated life quality impairment in 91 patients with CLM. Skin disease-associated life quality was significantly impaired. The degree of impairment correlated to the intensity of infection and the number of body areas affected. After treatment with ivermectin, life quality was rapidly restored.","Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a common neglected tropical skin disease caused by the migration of animal hookworm larvae into the epidermis.

We used a modified version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (mDLQI) to determine skin disease and associated life quality in 91 adult child patients with CLM, living in resource-poor communities in Manaus, Brazil. The symptoms of CLM were documented in the first weeks of treatment with ivermectin. The results showed a considerable reduction in skin disease or life quality at the time of diagnosis. The degree of impairment was correlated with intensity of infection, number of body areas affected (rho = 0.30; p  =  0.004). The presence of lesions in visible areas of the skin was also associated with the severity of the disease. Intense pruritis, sleep disturbance ( itching) and feeling shame were frequent skin disease–associated and life quality restrictions (reported 93.4%, 73.6%, and 64.8% in patients, respectively). These differences were observed in children and adults living in urban slums in North Brazil. These findings suggest that CLM may be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries."

It is a serious tropical disease that in some countries has spread in association with several factors such as human migration, precarious urbanization and vector adaptation to urban areas. In Brazil, although control measures such as the elimination of infected dogs, the application of residual insecticide and environmental management have been applied by the health authorities, however, they have not resulted in any significant reduction in VL incidence. The knowledge of bionomic parameters of vector populations is critical for the understanding of the transmission dynamic of VL and to evaluate prevention and control measures. Therefore, in the present study we applied the mark-release-recapture (MRR) method to evaluate under field conditions some basic bionomic parameters of a population of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex. Our findings demonstrate a high survival rate of this vector and a low population dispersal. These results suggest that measures applied to dog populations to prevent sand fly bites could contribute to the reduction of the surviving vector population and indirectly to the reduction of the host biting rate. Additionally, the low dispersal suggests that environmental management could contribute to the reduction of vector density. Our data serve as the first estimates of vector survival rates of populations of the sibling species Lu. longipalpis under natural conditions and could be applied in the evaluation of prevention and control measures.","Zoonotic Visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a neglected tropical disease in the Americas caused by infection with Leishmania infantum domestic dog (Canis familiaris) and the main parasite reservoir in urban areas. The parasite is mainly transmitted by two sibling species of Lutzomyia longipalpis spreading in several countries including Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and recently Uruguay. The bionomic parameters of population survival and duration of gonotrophic cycle are critical for evaluating vector capacity, field studies rarely applied to sand fly populations. In this study, we sought to evaluate basic parameters related to vectorial capacity in the S-9-methylgermacrene-B population of Luizomyia shortipalpais complex in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo. Our results demonstrate that the high survival rate of the vector population and low dispersal are associated with the presence of necessary conditions for establishment of maintenance of peridomiciles in the area. These findings contribute to basic data necessary for understanding ZVL dynamics and evaluation of the implementation of prevention and control measures."

An important function of the intestinal epithelial cells is coordinating the immune response to microbial signals, ranging from tolerance towards beneficial species to a robust anti-pathogen immune response. The mechanisms underlying the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to specifically distinguish pathogens from commensal bacteria are only partially understood. Commensal and enteropathogenic E. coli strains are highly similar and both reside in the gut lumen. However, only the pathogen is equipped with a type III protein secretion system, which is employed to inject effector proteins into the host cells. Here we show that epithelial cells distinguish the pathogenic from the highly similar commensal E. coli strains through specific sensing of the TTSS activity and respond by triggering a novel defense signaling pathway, but the pathogen attempt to avoid its detection by injection effectors that block the defense signaling.","Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common cause of infant diarrhea, associated with high risk of mortality in developing countries.

Here we present an extensive molecular simulation study which shed light on the exquisite molecular recognition of the empirically-engineered complex between the RRM-bearing protein Rbfox and its RNA target pre-miR21.

It is caused by Schistosoma flatworms that live in the bloodstream. Current treatment relies on one drug, and no effective vaccine has yet been developed. Proteolytic enzymes (proteases) help the parasite survive in the mammalian host, allowing the schistosome to invade, feed, grow, reproduce and, manipulate the immune system. Thus, proteases are considered potential drug and vaccine targets. We previously described, and herein, investigate at the protein level, SmSP2, the major serine protease produced by the blood-dwelling stages of S. mansoni. We show that SmSP2 is secreted by the parasite and effectively processes host blood bioactive peptides and proteins that are involved in fibrinolysis and regulation of vascular tone. We propose, therefore, that SmSP2 modulates host hemostasis to promote parasite infection and survival. Thus, SmSP2 and similar proteins in other parasitic flatworms represent potential targets for novel drug or vaccine interventions.","Schistosoma mansoni is a major cause of tropical infectious disease, schistosomiasis. Recently, we discovered a group of trypsin-like serine proteases with domain organization unique to flatworm parasites containing thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR-1).

Here, we characterize the structural and proteolytic attributes of serine protein 2 (SmSP2) of Schistosomes mansoni, a major species responsible for tropical infectious diseases, and the major virulence factor of this parasite. SmSP2 comprises three domains: histidine stretch, TSR-2 and serine-like protease domain. The cleavage specificity and specificity of recombinant SmSPs were determined by positional scanning and multiplex combinatorial libraries. The determinants of specificity were identified in 3D homology models, demonstrating the trypsins-like endopeptidase mode of action. We also show that SmSP 2 is secreted, functions as a host-parasite interface and contributes to the survival of the parasite by manipulating the host vasodilatation and fibrinolysis. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which the parasite is able to manipulate the host's immune system."

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread virus that can cause severe organ disease such as hepatitis and pneumonitis in immune-compromised patients. Our decade-long study conveys compelling evidence for the implication of human γδ T cells in the immune response against HCMV, but their protective role could not be formally demonstrated in humans. In the present study we use the murine model of CMV infection which allows the spatial and temporal analysis of viral spread and anti-viral immune responses. We show that, in the absence of αβ T cells, γδ T cells control MCMV-induced hepatitis, pneumonitis and death by restricting viral load in the liver, lungs and spleen. γδ T cells expand in these organs and display memory features that could be further incorporated into vaccination strategies. In conclusion, γδ T cells represent an important arm in the immune response against CMV infection that could be particularly important in the context of αβ T cell immune-suppression.","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in immune-competent patients. γδ T cells are involved in the response to CMV and their role in protection is firmly established and their dependency on lymphocytes has been addressed.

Interestingly, although constitutively expressed, the inhibitor primarily appears to play an important role in sporozoite gliding, liver stage development and egress from hepatocytes whereas blood stage parasites lacking the inhibitor exhibited only mild attenuation. Parasite sexual stage development was not affected and development continued normally within the mosquito. However, sporozoites lacking the inhibitor show a strong phenotype; they are completely blocked in motility and thus cannot transmigrate or invade cells. Complementation of knockout parasites by exogenous expression of the inhibitor completely restored parasite virulence.","Plasmodium parasites express a potent inhibitor of cysteine proteases (ICP) during their life cycle. In this study, we generated a stage-specific knockout of Plasmodia berghei ICP (PbICP) that resulted in impaired sporozoite invasion into hepatocytes, despite the residual PbICPs protein being detectable in sporozoites. The vast majority of parasites invading the cultured hepatocyte cell line develop mature liver stages, and were able to initiate blood stage infection in mice. However, the blood stage parasites, completely lacking the ICP family, exhibited an attenuated phenotype and were unable to infect mosquitoes and develop oocyst stage infection. In addition, the parasites that were liberated from oocysts exhibited defective motility and invaded mosquito salivary glands in low numbers. Importantly, transfection of PbicP- knockout parasites with the pbicp-gfp construct fully reversed these defects. Taken together, these results suggest that the P.berghei inhibitor of ICP is essential for parasite motility, and appears to play a role in parasite development in hepatocytes and erythrocytes."

Replacement of core histones with histone variants has recently emerged as a key mechanism for regulating chromatin states. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z is of particular interest because it is essential for embryonic development and for proper execution of developmental gene expression programs during cellular specification. ESCs provide a good model for investigating the function of H2A.Z during lineage commitment because these cells can generate an unlimited number of equivalent descendants while maintaining the capacity to differentiate into any cell type in the organism. Divergent regions in H2A.Z are likely key for functional specialization, but we know little about how these differences contribute to chromatin regulation. Here, we show that the unique H2A.Z acidic patch domain is necessary for regulation of lineage commitment during ESC differentiation by linking transcription to chromatin dynamics. Our work provides a critical foundation for elucidating how H2A.Z incorporation is key to cell fate determination. These findings are particularly important given that H2A.Z has been implicated in many diseased conditions, including cancer.","The histone H2A variant is essential for embryonic development and proper control of developmental gene expression programs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In this study, we identified divergent regions of the amino acid sequence of the histone A variant of H2a.Z in the C-terminal acidic patch domain. We found that these divergent residues reside on the surface of histone octamer and reside in an uninterrupted acidic patch. Furthermore, we found that the divergent amino acids Gly92, Asp97, Ser98, and H3A.Z are critical for the lineage commitment to ESC differentiation. We also found that H3K4me3 promoters of ESCs including poised, bivalent promoters harbor activating repressive marks, and were enriched with H3.3 and H2K27me3 respectively. Our analysis revealed that H2AE.ZAP3 interacted with the deposition complex and displayed a highly similar distribution pattern compared to the wild-type. Our results suggest that H.Zap3 is tightly associated with chromatin, suggesting that the mutant is properly incorporated into chromatin."

In the current study, we applied a novel method for the reconstruction of cell lineage trees from microsatellite mutations accumulated during mouse life. We focused on the intestinal epithelium, since its stem cells were intensively studied by various tracing methods that clarified many aspects of their dynamics. We first showed the reliability of our method by confirming three previously established facts: the existence of “monoclonal conversion,” the absence of an immortal strand mechanism in colon stem cells, and the separation of the colon into small domains each with a common ancestor. We also answered a few open questions, showing that the colon's lineage is separated from other lineages such as the hematopoietic and pancreatic lineages. Overall, our work presents a new approach for the study of stem cell dynamics and can similarly be used for studying stem cell dynamics in other systems.","Stem cell dynamics in vivo have been studied using lineage tracing methods.

However, ART is currently a lifelong commitment because HIV persists during treatment despite being suppressed below detection. If therapy is stopped, the HIV reappears. A concerted effort is ongoing to develop new eradication therapies to prevent virus rebound, but there are challenges to be overcome. Our work is a major step forward in this process. We measured persistent HIV throughout the body during ART using bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) humanized mice, a model validated to study HIV persistence. HIV infected BLT mice were treated with tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir. Despite documented tissue penetration by these drugs, we found that HIV expression persists in cells isolated from all the tissues analyzed (bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, liver, lung, intestines and peripheral blood cells). We therefore complemented ART with an immunotoxin that specifically kills HIV expressing cells while leaving other cells untouched. Our results demonstrate a dramatic reduction in persistent HIV throughout the body resulting from the killing of virus producing cells. Thus, our study provides new insights into the locations of HIV persistence during ART and a demonstration that persistent HIV can be successfully targeted inside the body.","Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce HIV levels in plasma to undetectable levels, but little is known about the effects of ART outside of the peripheral blood and persistent virus production in tissue reservoirs.

In this study, we characterized the impact of targeted cytotoxic therapy on HIV RNA levels in multiple organs of bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) and humanized mice. We found that the drug penetration activity was sufficient to reduce, eliminate, and eliminate, HIV production in BLT mice undergoing ART. We also found that, compared to ART, the agent profoundly depleted productively infected cells systemically and systemically. These results offer proof-of-concept for targeted chemotoxic therapies as effective components of HIV eradication strategies."

Dengue is a very important public health problem in many developing countries. Recently, new tests to help diagnose patients with dengue have been developed. Evaluating these tests to see how well they perform in different countries and in different health care settings is an important process that helps to guide health care policy on whether these assays are likely to be useful in making a diagnosis, and if so, when best to use them. Our hospital-based results, using two different types of NS1 tests for diagnosing dengue, indicates that these tests are most sensitive when used during the first 3 days of illness and are most likely to be positive if the patient has primary dengue. Our results also show that a positive NS1 test result is a reflection of the amount of virus in the blood, so that patients with high amounts of virus in the blood are more likely to be NS1 positive.

In order to eliminate rabies, annual vaccination of at least 70% of the dog population is recommended. In SSA most rabies vaccination programmes use static point (SP) vaccination approaches. Despite being logistically and economically more feasible than door-to-door approaches, SP vaccination campaigns often result in low vaccination coverage. Here we investigated the reasons why attendance at SPs offering free rabies vaccinations for dogs is suboptimal in SSA. We analysed data from a citywide vaccination campaign in Blantyre city, Malawi in combination with household related data. Our results found that the distance from home to SP influences attendance at SPs. We also found a clear need for provision of timely and accurate information about upcoming campaigns, including information on the importance of puppies being vaccinated as well as ways to improve dog handling. Understanding the barriers to attendance at SPs and taking them into consideration, would make mass vaccination programmes more feasible thereby allowing high vaccination coverage to be achieved without the need for expensive and logistically challenging door-to-door programmes.","Rabies is a devastating and preventable disease that causes 59,000 human deaths annually.

The parasites are acquired when tsetse flies feed on an infected host, undergo multiplication in the fly gut and migrate to the salivary glands (SG). The cycle resumes once this infected fly transmits the parasites in conjunction with saliva to another host when feeding. We compared gene expression changes between parasitized and uninfected tsetse SG. We also assessed changes in parasite gene expression in the tsetse SG in relation to those present within vertebrate blood. We found that parasite infections increase expression of host proteins associated with stress and cell division, indicative of extensive cellular damage in SG. We also found that parasite infections reduce expression of the most highly expressed SG-specific secreted proteins, suggesting modification of saliva composition. The parasite transcriptome reveals changes in specific cell surface proteins and in metabolism related to glucose-amino acid utilization in the different host environments. This study provides information for critical understanding of tsetse-trypanosome interactions, and transcriptional changes that likely enable the parasite to persist in the varying environment of its insect and vertebrate hosts.","Trypanosoma brucei is a parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans.

Actinobacterial strains, such as Streptomyces, have been a source of most naturally derived antibiotics, as well as anticancer, anthelmintic, and antifungal drugs. These microorganisms also produce small molecules important in symbiotic interactions with insects, such as fungus-growing ants, fungus-growing termites, beetles and wasps against pathogens. Several novel compounds have been reported from these microorganisms with promising biological activities. In this work we show an interesting ecologic approach for drug discovery that also shows promise for the identification of antileishmanial natural products from fungus-growing ant ecosystem.

Most trypanosomes cannot infect humans as they die in human serum, but two mutants of Trypanosoma brucei have evolved the ability to survive in human serum. This survival in human serum is conferred by the presence of one gene in the East African human-infective T. b. rhodesiense. How often trypanosomes exchange genetic material (they can mate in the tsetse fly) is debated, but will impact upon the spread of genes (e.g. that which confers human infectivity) through a population. We studied T. b. rhodesiense populations from different geographic locations (Malawi and two locations in Uganda), and over time (Uganda), to see if the populations are stable over time and space, using a panel of variable genetic markers enabling assessment of diversity. Our results suggest that there is significant difference in diversity between locations; those in Uganda are very closely related, increasingly so over time, whereas the Malawi population is very genetically diverse, consistent with the trypanosomes mating. These findings suggest that a greater understanding of T. b. rhodesiense population evolution will inform on sleeping sickness epidemiology.","Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense is an unusual pathogenic protozoa that infects humans and livestock in East and Southern Africa. It is a classically described host-range variant of non-human infective Trypanosomiasis that occurs in stable clonal lineages, incorporating spatial and temporal analyses.

In contrast, populations with stable dominant genotypes changed their genetic diversity reduced over time. These populations conform to criteria for strict clonality, stability and predominant genotypes at time, and in the period between the mid 1990s, previously predominant genotypes were detected and replaced by a novel clonal population with a limited genetic relationship to the original population present from 1970 to 1990. We demonstrate that the Malawi T.b. rodesiense population demonstrated significantly greater diversity and evidence of frequent genetic exchange than previously described. These findings have important implications for the spread of a single copy of the T. bruceisense gene, which allows human infectivity, epidemiology and human disease, suggesting parasites represent an important organism to study the influence of optional recombination on population genetic dynamics."

The neurons carry information as spikes that are transmitted to other neurons via connections with different strengths and propagation delays. Experimentally observed learning rules can modify the strengths of connections between neurons based on the timing of their spikes. The learning that occurs in neuronal networks due to these rules is thought to be vital to creating the structures necessary for different cognitive processes as well as for memory. The spiking rate of populations of neurons has been observed to oscillate at particular frequencies in various brain regions, and there is evidence that these oscillations play a role in cognition. Here, we use analytical and numerical methods to investigate the changes to the network structure caused by a specific learning rule during oscillatory neural activity. We find the conditions under which connections with propagation delays that resonate with the oscillations are strengthened relative to the other connections. We demonstrate that networks learn to oscillate more strongly to oscillations at the frequency they were presented with during learning. We discuss the possible application of these results to specific areas of the brain.","Learning rules, spike-timers-dependent plasticity (STDP), change the structure of networks of neurons based on firing activity.

We develop analytical models of learning additive STDP recurrent networks driven by oscillatory inputs, which support the results of simulations of leaky integrate-to-fire neurons. In addition, we show that the selective modulation of the amplitude of the oscillatory response frequency can lead to selective amplitude of oscillatory responses in a single recurrent network.

This leishmania species can be delivered by pool blood feeding zoo-anthropophilic phlebotomine flies to several mammals, the dog population being recognized as the main reservoir. Transmission from infected dogs to humans is through the bite of female phlebotomine sand flies. The disease is endemic in several countries and Brazil has a high prevalence of cases with over 3000 ZVL cases reported per year. The main, inefficient and highly controversial, control measure in Brazil has been culling sero-positive dogs. The community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs could be an alternative to control L. infantum transmission from phlebotomine flies to humans. The rationale is that phlebotomine flies which sampled their blood meals from dogs treated with systemic insecticides would die reducing the risk of L. infantum transmission. To reduce the number of ZVL cases, a large proportion of dogs in the community should be treated and the systemic insecticide used should be effective in killing phlebotomine flies acting as vectors of L. infantum parasites for a significant amount of time. We used a mathematical model mimicking L. infantum transmission to show that this novel vector control strategy could be effective. We identified the combination of different key parameters (e.g. insecticide efficacy, duration and proportion of dogs treated) that could lead to a significant reduction of the risk of L. infantum infection in humans.","Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted by phlebotomine flies. Currently, systemic insecticides for dogs are registered in a zoo-anthropophilic pool of blood feeding phlebocytes. To predict the impact of community-wide use of systemic insecticide in dog populations as a public health measure to control transmission of Leishmann infantum in humans, we developed a mathematical model to describe the transmission dynamics of L. infantum to dogs, vectorial capacity and term to represent transmission dynamics in dogs.

All the clinical symptoms of malaria are attributed to the blood stage of the parasite life cycle during which Plasmodium merozoites invade and multiply within host erythrocytes. Invasion by Plasmodium merozoites is a complex process that requires multiple molecular interactions between the invading parasite and target erythrocyte. Parasite proteins that mediate such interactions are localized in membrane bound internal organelles at the apical end of merozoites called micronemes and rhoptries. The timely secretion of microneme and rhoptry proteins to the merozoite surface to allow receptor binding is a crucial step in the invasion process. In this study, we demonstrate that exposure of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites to low potassium ion concentrations as found in blood plasma provides the natural signal that triggers a rise in intracellular calcium, which in turn triggers secretion of microneme proteins to the merozoite surface. Subsequently, binding of released microneme proteins with erythrocyte receptors provides the signal for release of rhoptry proteins. These studies open the path for analysis of signal transduction pathways involved in apical organelle secretion. A clear understanding of these pathways will enable development of inhibitors that block secretion of key parasite proteins required for receptor-binding. Such inhibitors will block erythrocyte invasion and inhibit parasite growth, providing promising leads for development of novel drugs against malaria.","The invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites requires specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands. Parasite proteins bind to erythropoietic receptors and invade localized apical organelles called micronemes and rhoptries. The secretion of microneme rhoptry proteins on the merozite surface is a critical step in the invasion process. The sequence of secretion events that trigger release of these proteins is not known. In this study, we developed flow cytometry based methods to measure the relative levels of cytosolic calcium on the surface of the membrane proteins of the parasite. We show that the expression of apical membrane proteins is regulated by different external signals. We demonstrate that exposure to low potassium ion concentrations found in blood plasma leads to a rise in the basal calcium levels of phospholipase C mediated pathway. The rise in cytocolic calcium triggers secretion of the micronema proteins 175 kD and the apical protein binding antigen (EBA175) on the membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) of the eryzoite surface. Subsequently, the interaction of EBA175 and glycophorin (glyA) with the receptor of the receptor, the receptor for the parasite, triggers the release of rhopTry proteins. These results provide a starting point for the dissection of signal transduction pathways involved in regulated exocytosis of key apical organselles."

As a result, insufficient blood supply and high fluid pressure begin to appear inside the tumor which leads to a reduced delivery of drugs within the tumor, especially in tumor center. A treatment strategy that utilizes anti-vascular drugs is observed to revert these alterations in tumor vessels, making them more normal. This approach is suggested to improve drug delivery by enhancing physical transport of drugs. In this paper, we build a mathematical model to simulate tumor and vessel growth as well as fluid pressure inside the tumor. This framework enables us to simulate drug treatment scenarios on tumors. We use this model to find whether the delivery of the chemotherapy drugs is enhanced by application of anti-vascular drugs by making vessels more normal. Our simulations show that anti-vascular drug not only enhances the amount of drugs that is released into tumor tissue, but also enhances drug distribution enabling drug release in the central regions of tumor.","Tumor-induced angiogenesis leads to the development of leaky tumor vessels devoid of structural and morphological integrity. In this study, we show that elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and low blood perfusion emerge as common properties of the tumor microenvironment that act as barriers to drug delivery. In order to overcome these barriers, normalization of the vasculature is considered a viable option. However, insight is needed to understand the phenomenon of normalization under these conditions and to realize its promise. We develop a mathematical model that incorporates tumor growth, angiogenic IFP, and IFP. We administer theoretical combinations of antiangiogenic agents and cytotoxic nanoparticles in heterogeneous vasculatures. We observe that differences in drug extravasation depend on the scheduling of combined therapy; concurrent therapy, total drug extravascular therapy, increased adjuvant therapy, and drugs penetrate deeper into the tumor."

While sentinel functions of DCs are essential for establishment of an antiviral state, HIV-1 can subvert DC function for its dissemination. One of the mechanisms by which DCs can mediate virus spread is via the trans infection pathway whereby DCs capture HIV-1 particles and retain them in an infectious state without getting infected, and pass these infectious particles to CD4+ T cells upon initiation of cellular contacts. In this report, we demonstrate that expression of Siglec-1or CD169, on DC surface is responsible for capture of HIV-1 particles by binding the ganglioside, GM3, present in the virion lipid bilayer. This interaction between CD169 and GM3 targets captured virus particles to non-degradative compartments and resulted in retention of virus particle infectivity within DCs. Upon initiation of T cell contacts with virus-laden DCs, HIV-1 particles were trafficked to the DC – T synaptic junctions and transferred to T cells for establishment of productive infection. These studies define a novel host-encoded receptor – ligand interaction that drives HIV-1 dissemination and can be used for development of novel anti-viral therapeutics.","Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) interactions with myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) result in virus dissemination to CD4+ T cells via a trans infection pathway dependent on virion incorporation into the host cell derived from glycosphingolipid (GSL) and GM3. The mechanism of DC-mediated HIV-1 trans infection is extremely efficacious and result in infection of multiple CD4 + T cells and exploratory contacts on the DC surface. However, the mechanism of how DCs activate the type I IFN signaling pathway dramatically enhances HIV-mediated T cell trans infection remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the type IFN-inducible Siglec-1, CD169, DC receptor captures HIV in a GM3-dependent manner. Selective downregulation of CD169 expression, neutralizing CD169 function, depletion of GSLs virions, abrogated DC-dependent HIV-infection and trans infection, and exogenous expression of the CD169 receptor- naïve cells rescued the GSL-dependent capture of trans infection. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of pathogen parasitization by the host encoded cellular recognition machinery (GM3–CD169 interaction) and DC-independent HIV dissemination."

Cartilage-producing cells (chondrocytes) first secrete a cartilage matrix around themselves that is rich in sugar-coated proteins called proteoglycans (PGs). Chondrocytes then undergo a maturation process during which they express Indian hedgehog (Ihh), a secreted protein that stimulates bone formation in surrounding cells. Here, we find that PGs in cartilage matrix regulate the timing of chondrocyte maturation, showing that interactions between cells and an environment that they themselves create are crucial for proper skeletal development. Our conclusions are based upon analyses of zebrafish with mutations in two different PG synthesis genes that produce identical skeletal defects. We argue that, as a consequence of deficient cartilage PG production, mutant chondrocytes accelerate the timing of ihh expression, which we show causes early and increased bone production in the surrounding cells.","Chondrocytes are a group of cells that interact with the extracellular environment over time. They form a proteoglycan (PG)-rich matrix, which undergo a developmental transition, termed “maturation,” and express ihh to induce bone overlying tissue, the perichondrium. In this study, we ask whether PGs regulate interactions between chondrosomes and perihelminates. We show that cartilage PGs are required to inhibit the formation of the perichelminate matrix, and that this process ultimately dictates the timing of perichonral bone development. Using a mutagenesis screen, we isolated a class of mutants that decreased the cartilage matrix and increased perichonal bone formation. We identified two genes, fam20b and xylosyltransferase1 (xylt1), that encode PG synthesis enzymes. Mutants failed to produce wild-type levels of chondroitin sulfate PGs, normally abundant in cartilage, and initiated perichionral bone formation earlier than their wild-types siblings. Primary chondrotte defects induce bone phenotype, but secondarily, mutant chondroidcytes precociously initiated maturation, showing increased early expression of markers such as runx2b, collagen type 10a1, ihh co-orthologs, and ihha. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated aberrant matrix organization and early cellular features in chondrodral bone and hypertrophy mutants. Refining previous in vitro reports, we demonstrated that fam20B and xylt 1 are involved in PG synthesis, and in vivo analyses reveal that these genes function to regulate cartilage and matrix production, and ultimately regulate timing of skeletal development."

Studies have found that a variety of domestic and wildlife animals can be infected by SFTS virus (SFTSV), but the natural reservoir host for the virus remains unclear. Although the SFTSV-RNA was identified in certain species of ticks or their larvae, contamination from their host animals cannot be excluded to be the source. We analyzed 9,984 ticks collected from vegetation or feeding mammals in 2013–2014 in Jiangsu province, an endemic area in China, and detected SFTSV-RNA in both parasitic and questing ticks. Interestingly, SFTSV-RNA was identified in larvae of Haemaphysalis longicornis, collected in vegetation without being blood fed, indicating a possibility of a vertical transmission of SFTSV in H. longicornisis in nature. We also detected SFTSV-RNA in four mammal species which may serve as natural amplifying hosts for SFTSV. In addition, we identified antibodies against the virus in two migratory bird species, suggesting wild birds, exposed to infected ticks, could spread the virus through flyways for long-distance transmission.

We found high variability in expression of viral genes among individual cells. This heterogeneity was used to map cells into their infection state and allowed to uncover a yet unrecognized host response. We also provide evidence that variability in host metabolic states provided a sensitive tool to decipher between susceptible and resistant cells.","Infection with large dsDNA viruses can lead to a profound alteration of the host transcriptome and metabolome in order to provide essential building blocks to support high metabolic demand for viral assembly and egress. Host response to viral infection typically lead to diverse phenotypic outcome that include a shift in host life cycle activation and an anti-viral defense response. However, a major bottleneck is to discern viral hijacking strategies and host defense responses averaging the bulk of the population response. In this study, we investigated the interaction between Emiliania huxleyi, bloom-forming alga, and specific virus (EhV) in an ecologically important host-virus model system in the ocean. We quantified host virus gene expression and single-cell resolution over the course of infection, using an automatic microfluidic setup to capture individual algal cells multiplex and quantitate PCR. We revealed high heterogeneity in viral gene expression in individual cells. Simultaneous measurements of expression profiles of host virus genes at the single-cells level allowed mapping infected cells to newly defined infection states and allowed the detection of a specific host response subpopulation in the infected cell masked by the majority of the infected population. Intriguingly, resistant cells emerged from viral infection, showing unique expression profiles and metabolic genes that could provide the basis for discerning viral resistant cells from heterogeneous populations in the marine environment. Our results suggest that resolving the host-viruses arms race at the individual-cell level may provide important mechanistic insights into viral life cycles and uncover host defense strategies."

Thus, a protein’s function can be inferred from the prevailing functions of its network neighbors. However, the network neighborhood is highly dynamic and so, we argue, a protein’s function should be. Based on this premise, we evaluate how a protein’s function might change in a specific dynamic context of breast cancer. This novel approach uniquely reveals several functions that are significantly lost or gained in cancer. Moreover, the PIN-induced sample-specific functional activity provides a novel characterization of cancer sample that can help predict patient survival as well as several known subtypes of breast cancer.","Genome function is an important feature of the human immune system, and it is important to understand how the immune system responds to changes in the environment.

We found that the functions of these genes were significantly gained from lost genes in cancer, differential expression of genes known to perform function, and changes in network topology. We predicted functional changes supported by mutational copy number profiles of breast cancers.

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can infect many avian and mammalian hosts, but while few IAV subtypes circulate in human populations, subtype diversity is extensive in wild bird populations. How do these subtypes coexist in wild avian populations and do they compete within these natural host populations? Here we experimentally challenged mallard ducks with different IAVs to study how an initial infection with H3N8 determines the outcome of later infections (duration of infection and virus load) and antibody responses. There was complete protection to re-infection with the same H3N8 virus based on virus isolation. In addition, there was partial protection induced by H3N8 pre-challenge to other subtypes and development of heterosubtypic immunity indicated by significantly shorter infections and reduction in viral load compared to controls. This indicates that subtype dynamics in the host population are not independent. Amongst H3N8 pre-challenged groups, the highest protection was conferred to the H4N5 subtype which was most genetically related to H3N8. The H4N5 challenge also induced an increase in H3 antibody levels in that challenge group and evidence for original antigenic sin or antigenic seniority. Thus, previous infections with IAV can influence the outcome of subsequent challenge with different IAV subtypes. These results not only have relevance to understanding naturally occurring subtype diversity in wild avian populations but also in understanding potential outcomes associated with introduction of novel viruses such as highly pathogenic IAV H5 viruses in wild bird populations.","Influenza virus (IAV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in avian populations. It has been proposed that host population immunity directed by multiple antigens can influence the prevalence, diversity, and evolution of influenza virus (IAV) in the avian population. Here, we investigate how initial infection influences the outcome of later infections of homologous heterologous IAV subtypes that interact with host immune responses. We carried out two experimental infections of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) with H3N8, a low-pathogenic IAV, in two groups. The first group was challenged with a different type of IAV (H4N5, H10N7, H6N2, H12N5) and the second group was inoculated with an IAV-specific subtype (H3N9). We found that the two groups were more resistant to infection than the controls. These results suggest that competition between related subtypes may regulate IAV population dynamics in nature. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the host-host IAV complex interactions and the drivers of the IAV antigenic diversity that allow the circulation of multiple subtypes in wild ducks."

Most bacteria contain, besides a single chromosome, autonomously replicating units called plasmids. Many plasmids carry genes enabling them to be transferred into plasmid-free bacteria. This process, called conjugation, contributes significantly to HGT. Many plasmids also contain antibiotic resistance genes. Therefore, plasmid conjugation plays a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the regulation of conjugation genes is essential for designing strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. We have studied the regulation of the native plasmid pLS20 from Bacillus subtilis. Besides being a soil bacterium, B. subtilis is a gut commensal in animals and humans. Here we unraveled the mechanisms controlling conjugation and found that pLS20 conjugation genes become activated when plasmid-free recipient cells are present. We have identified the repressor protein that keeps conjugation in an ‘OFF’ state, and an anti-repressor that activates conjugation. The activity of the anti-repressor is inhibited by a pLS20-encoded peptide that is secreted from the cell and can be absorbed by cells, after a secondary processing step. Ultimately, it is the signaling-peptide that dictates when conjugation genes become activated.","Horizontal gene transfer mediated by plasmid conjugation plays a significant role in the evolution of bacterial species, dissemination of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity determinants. Characterization of regulation is important for gaining insights into its features. Relatively little is known about how conjugations of Gram-positive plasmids are regulated. Here, we characterized the expression of the native Bacillus subtilis pLS20 gene. Contrary to enterococcal and other Gram-negative Plasmids, conjugated pLSs are activated by recipient-produced pheromones. We found that conjugate is kept in a default “” state and identified a master repressor responsible for its repression. Activation of conjugating genes requires relief from repression, mediated by an anti-repressor that belongs to the Rap family of proteins. Using RNA sequencing methodology and genetic approaches, we determined the regulatory effects of repressor and anti-receptor expression on pLS 20 genes. We show that the activity of the anti-regressor is regulated by an intercellular signaling peptide. Ultimately, the peptide dictates the timing of conjugeation. The implications of this regulatory mechanism in comparison to mobile systems are discussed."

Control of the vector mosquito is the major practice to prevent dengue. However, it is not well known how the virus can infect some mosquito strains but fail to do so with other refractory strains. To address that question, we conducted whole genome microarray based gene expression studies between susceptible and refractory strains of A. aegypti to identify gene expression patterns following challenge with dengue virus. Our analysis of the early infection periods reveals that a large number of genes are involved in a highly coordinated manner either to host or defend against the virus. Genes responding to dengue infection were clustered in seven expression modules. Genes associated with susceptibility to infection were largely clustered in one expression module, while those associated with refractoriness were distributed in four distinct modules. A common core set of genes expressed in both susceptible and refractory individuals were clustered in two expression modules. We identified genes and specific pathways that potentially regulate compatible or non-compatible interactions between dengue virus and the mosquito, most notably energy metabolism and DNA replication in the susceptible response in contrast to cell growth and death in the refractory response.","The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans, and DENV is an important arbovirus in the subtropics and tropics of the tropics.

In several of the endemic areas, it co-exists with onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF). Because of the benefit individuals suffering from onchocerciasis could have by taking ivermectin where the disease is severe, despite the risk of developing serious side-effects due to being co-infected with L. loa, mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin for the control of onchocerciasis has been ongoing in areas where the two diseases overlap. Ivermectin is also effective against loiasis. It is, therefore, hypothesized that several years of ivermectin MDA against onchocerciasis in those areas may have impacted on parasitological indicators for loiasis. In particular, we assess the impact of annual community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) on loiasis with specific reference to the relationship between adherence to treatment and the risk of developing severe (nervous system) complications following ivermectin treatment.

Repeated treatments of ivermectin are delivered in an annual community directed treatment with ivermicectin (CDTI) approach for years to control onchocerciasis of Loa loa-Onchocerca volvulus in co-endemic areas. However, the impact of CDTI on loiasis and parasitological indicators is not known. In this study, we designed a cross sectional study to explore the effects of rounds of CDT on loiiasis and parasites. We recruited 3,684 individuals from 36 communities in 3 CDTI projects in Cameroon and 9 villages in a non-CDTI district. We found that loiasis prevalence was 29.3% (range = 24.2%–34.6%) in the non- CDTI district and 16.0% (3.3%,–26.6%) in the CDTI in the West and 10 in the Northwest Southwest 2 districts, with reductions of 30.5%, 17.9%, 8.1%, and 7.8% (compared to 14 rounds) registered post CDTI, respectively. Similar trends in infection intensity and infection intensity were observed at both sites. We also found a negative relationship between adherence to ivermiectin treatment and the prevalence/intensity of infection at the two sites."

This feature helps to avoid conflicts between head-on replication and transcription. The precise consequences of the conflict and how it affects genome organization remain to be understood. We previously found that reversing the transcription bias slows replication in the Bacillus subtilis genome. Here we engineered new inversions to avoid changes in other aspects of genome organization. We found that the reversed transcription bias is sufficient to decrease replication speed, and it results in lowered fitness of the inversion strains and a competitive disadvantage relative to wild-type cells in minimal medium. Further, by analyzing genomic copy-number snapshots to obtain replication speed as a function of genome position, we found that inversion of the strongly-transcribed rRNA genes obstructs replication during growth in rich medium. This confers a strong growth disadvantage to cells in rich medium, turns on DNA damage responses, and leads to cell death in a subpopulation of cells, while the surviving cells are more sensitive to genotoxic agents. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that evolution has favored co-orientation of transcription with replication, mainly to avoid these effects.","Bacteria have a genome-wide bias against co-orientation between replication and transcription, in which essential and/or highly-regulated genes are enriched co-directionally. We previously found that reversing this bias in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis slows replication elongation, suggesting that this effect contributes to evolutionary pressure on selecting transcription-replication co- orientation bias. However, this selection is not based purely on selection for speedy replication; alternatively, slowed replication can actually represent an average of individual replication-disruption events, counter-selected independently of genome integrity. To differentiate between these possibilities and define the precise forces driving this aspect of genome organization, we generated new strains with inversions of ∼1/4 chromosome ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons. We found that replication rates vary dramatically in the inverted region of the genome. Replication was moderately impeded in the inversion region, which results in a small significant competitive disadvantage in the minimal medium. Importantly, replication was strongly obstructed in the highly inverted region, resulting in disruption of DNA replication, activation of DNA damage responses, and loss of genomic integrity. Our results strongly suggest that the preservation of genome structure drives evolution of co-opting replication transcription, a conserved feature in genome organization."

Humans are accidental hosts, and acquire the disease primarily from contact with water sources that have been contaminated with urine from infected animals. Rats are asymptomatic carriers of infection and are critical for disease transmission to humans, particularly in urban slum environments. In this study, investigation of Leptospira directly isolated from the urine of infected rats showed acetylation or tri-methylation of the highly abundant leptospiral lipoprotein, LipL32. In comparison, Leptospira grown in culture did not result in any LipL32 lysine modifications. A synthetic peptide derived from LipL32 that incorporated a tri-methylated lysine modification exhibited less reactivity with serum from leptospirosis patients compared to an unmodified version of the peptide, suggesting LipL32 modifications may alter protein recognition by the immune response. This study reports, for the first time, modification of a Leptospira protein during infection, and suggests these modifications may have a functional consequence that contributes to bacterial persistence during infection.","Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease caused by the pathogenic Leptospira spp., is a major public health problem in the developing world. Rats serve asymptomatic carriers of the pathogen and are critical for the disease spread. In their reservoir hosts, leptospires colonize the kidney, shed urine, and persist in fresh water to gain access to new mammalian host breaches and skin. Previous studies have provided evidence for post-translational modification (PTM) of leptopiral proteins. In this current study, we demonstrate that the presence of a highly abundant leptoviral protein, LipL32, in rat urine- isolated from L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni compared to vitro-grown organisms.

( 241 words )","Many natural pathogens elicit large antigen-specific long-lived effector memory CD8 T cell responses that contribute to pathogen protection and control. This strategy is also employed by novel CD8 T cell vaccine vectors. In the real world, the host is likely to encounter a number of such pathogens at different times but the effect of pre-existing effector memory pools on the development of new CD8 T cell responses against unrelated infections, and vice versa, is still unclear. We address this through mouse models of sequential infection with MCMV and an Ad-Hu5 vaccine vector. We find that the host is able to accommodate and accumulate multiple new specificities of inflating effector memory populations at different times but certain infections, such as acute MCMV, appear to rapidly deplete existing memory populations via a Fas-dependent pathway. Additionally, immunization with vectors based on human adenovirus subtype 5 do not appear to detrimentally affect the host’s pre-existing effector memory pool.

In this study, we investigated the ability of AdHu5 and Ad-LacZ vectors to generate a large population of effector T cell populations in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infected mice. We found that acute MCMV infection led to a rapid decline of the pre-existing Ad-lacZ-specific inflating population, associated with bystander activation and Fas-dependent apoptotic pathways. These data indicate firstly that multiple specificities of inflating memory cells acquired at different times stably co-exist, revealing the importance of order in order in infection acquisition. Importantly, immunization with the Ad-lu5 vector did not alter the size of the existing memory population. These phenomena are relevant for the development of adenoviral vectors for novel vaccination strategies against diverse infections and cancers."

Much recent work has uncovered the importance of the role of the sex-determination pathway in the expression of sexually dimorphic traits. However, critical interactions between this pathway and other growth regulatory mechanisms – for example, the physiological mechanisms involved in nutrition-dependent expression of these traits – are less well understood. In this study, we provide evidence of a developmental link between nutrition-sensitivity and sexual differentiation in the giant mandibles of the sexually dimorphic stag beetle, Cyclommatus metallifer. We examined the regulation and function of a key sex determination gene in animals, doublesex (dsx), and its interaction with juvenile hormone (JH), an important insect hormone known to regulate insect polyphenisms including the regulation of the disproportionate growth of male stag beetle mandibles. We found that Cmdsx changes mandibular responsiveness to JH in a sex-specific pattern. Based on these results, we hypothesize that sex-specific regulation of JH responsiveness is a developmental link between nutrition and sexual differentiation in stag beetles.","Sexual dimorphisms in trait expression are widespread in animals, especially pronounced ornaments that are weapons of sexual selection, and attain exaggerated sizes. Expression of exaggerated traits is usually male-specific and nutrition sensitive. Consequently, developmental mechanisms generating sexually dimorphic growth and nutrition-dependent phenotypic plasticity likely regulate expression of extreme structures. We know little about how these mechanisms work, and how they interact. We investigated the developmental mechanisms of sex-specific mandible growth in the stag beetle Cyclommatus metallifer, focusing on the doublesex gene function and interaction with juvenile hormone (JH) signaling. We found that female-specific splice variants of Cmdsx contribute to insensitivity to female mandibles to JH treatment. We also found that the knockdown of a mutant mutant gene in females increased the sensitivity of female mandibular cells, indicating that the sex determination of JH signaling pathways may be important in determining the developmental fates of final sizes of secondary-sexual characters."

Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 that also displays β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion in humans. Given these similarities in β-cell dysfunction in T2D and DS, we developed a trisomy 21 screening method to identify genes that may be important in T2D. This approach used different DS mouse models combined with human gene expression data from T2D β-cells. From this we identified a single candidate, Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1). High RCAN1 expression occurs in human and mouse T2D islets. Increased RCAN1 expression in mice reduced β-cell mitochondrial function and ATP availability, and this has negative implications for multiple ATP-dependent steps in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease associated with obesity, insulin resistance, hypoinsulinemia and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction.

We also identified a region of the chromosome 21 containing genes that cause hyperglycemia. We identified a set of ~5,000 gene expression changes and identified a large gene expression analysis in human T2D β-cells. Our approach produced a single gene, RCAN1, which is a candidate gene linking hyperglycymia and functional changes in T2Ds β- cells. We demonstrated that this gene is methylated in human islets at multiple sites, correlating with increased expression. We found that RCAN 1 protein expression increased in db/db mouse islets exposed to high glucose. Mice overexpressing RCAN- reduced in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and β-cells displayed mitochondrial dysfunction including hyperpolarised membrane potential, reduced oxidative phosphorylation and low ATP production.

Here, we analyze the regulatory network that drives terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the cells of the vertebrate central nervous system that form myelin and thereby guarantee rapid saltatory conduction. We show that the transcription factor Myrf is directly activated by the transcription factor Sox10, and map a Sox10-responsive enhancer to an evolutionarily conserved element in intron 1 of the Myrf gene. We then go on to show that once induced, Myrf physically interacts and functionally cooperates with its inducer Sox10 to activate myelin genes arguing that the two jointly drive terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes. With this study we define an essential module in the myelin-specific regulatory network in the central nervous system. By comparing this module with the corresponding module in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system which consists of Sox10 and the Krox20 transcription factor we furthermore conclude that myelination in the two compartments of the vertebrate nervous system is regulated by similarly organized, but differentially implemented regulatory networks.","Myelin is essential for rapid saltatory conduction produced by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system.

Existing connectome data validate these predictions indicating the importance of our findings for large scale neural circuit analysis.","Neurons collect synaptic inputs from neurons by sending arborized dendritic structures into the brain. However, the relationship between the shape of dendrites and the precise organization of synaptic inputs in neural tissue remains unclear.

We find that the distribution of branching structures depends strongly on cell types, indicating possible fundamental differences in synaptic input organization. Furthermore, we find that branching statistics are weakly correlated with branching statistics, suggesting that these features may reflect features that are not captured in commonly studied branching statistics. We use morphological models based on optimal wiring principles to study the relation between input distributions and dendrite branching structures.

Despite this, the molecular basis for how zinc deficiency compromises host control of infection remains to be understood. We show that dietary zinc deficiency impacts host tissue zinc abundances and its mobilization during infection by the major respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Zinc acts as a direct antimicrobial against the pathogen, mobilized by phagocytic cells as a component of the innate immune response. Although immune activation and infiltration of phagocytic cells is unaffected by host zinc status, the lack of antimicrobial zinc compromises bacterial control in zinc deficient hosts. These findings highlight the importance of zinc sufficiency in resisting bacterial infection.","Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, and the molecular basis of protection remains unclear. In this study, we report that dietary zinc levels dictate the outcome of bacterial infection in a murine model.

In addition, the activation of murine phagocytic cells is affected by zinc restriction, and efficacy of bacterial control is compromised. We show that S. pneumoniaes is highly sensitive to zinc intoxication, and that this process is impaired in mice isolated from phagocytes.

The chromatin environment at gene promoters, including positioned nucleosomes that may display functional histone modifications, is a key regulator of gene expression, contributing to transcriptional activation and repression.

Often resulting in a short-lived non-coding RNA transcript, the function of antisense transcription is poorly understood. Using next-generation sequencing techniques, we characterized transcription in human breast cancer cells and found extensive correlations between antisense transcription and the chromatin environment at promoters. We found that downstream antisense transcription initiates from between regularly positioned nucleosomes and that those nucleosomes between sense and downstream antisense transcription start sites display histone modifications associated with active gene promoters. Chromatin remodelers and other protein complexes responsible for creation and maintenance of the promoter chromatin environment associate with this same region, suggesting an important role of antisense transcription in the regulation of gene expression.","Antisense transcription is a prevalent feature of mammalian promoters.

Certain CMVs and other large DNA viruses encode homologs of the cell-surface molecule CD48, a ligand of the 2B4 receptor involved in regulating the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Here, we have investigated for the first time the immunomodulatory potential of one of these viral molecules. We show that A43, a CD48 homolog encoded by owl monkey CMV, is a soluble molecule that exhibits exceptional binding kinetics for 2B4, and is furthermore capable of blocking the interaction with its counter-receptor CD48. Moreover, we reveal how this viral protein interferes with human NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by inhibiting the immune synapse between human NK cells and target cells. Thus, these findings not only underscore the importance of 2B4-mediated immune responses in controlling CMV infections, but also unveil the shedding of a virally-encoded soluble variant of CD48 as a new viral counteract mechanism for subverting immune surveillance.","Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) capture genes from their hosts, employing derived proteins to evade host immune defenses.

Here, we show that CD48, a cosignaling molecule expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells, modulates the function of the natural killer (NK) cytotoxic cells by binding to the natural ligand 2B4 (CD244). A43, encoded by the owl monkey CMV, is a soluble molecule released from the cell proteolytically processed membrane at the proximal region. A43 expressed immediate-early kinetics, yielding a protein rapidly detected in supernatant infected cells. Remarkably, surface plasmon resonance assays revealed that the viral protein binds to the host CD48:2B4 receptor at high affinity and slow dissociation rates.

It is thereby critical for proper functioning of the nervous system. Myelin in the central nervous system is synthesized by oligodendrocytes. Because myelin has a high lipid content, it is vulnerable to lipid metabolism disorders. It is unknown whether extracellular lipids also contribute to myelination by oligodendrocytes under healthy conditions, and if they do, what the origin of these lipids would be.Here, we show that formation of myelin membrane in mice does not only need lipid synthesis by oligodendrocytes, but also requires extracellular lipids provided by astrocytes. Indeed, when lipid synthesis was inactivated in either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes, myelin membrane synthesis was reduced. However, when lipid synthesis was inactivated in both cell types, myelin membrane synthesis was virtually absent. Furthermore, when lipid synthesis was inactivated in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes bypassed this deficiency by using dietary lipids for myelin membrane synthesis. Furthermore, a high-fat diet could promote myelin synthesis. We conclude that extracellular lipids, either provided by astrocytes or in the diet, contribute to myelination by oligodendrocytes during normal brain development.","In the vertebrate nervous system, myelination of axons requires the synthesis of large amounts of lipids and proteins from oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Myelin membranes are thought to be cell-autonomously assembled in axon-associated glial cells. In this study, we report a surprising finding that in normal brain development, a substantial fraction of the lipids incorporated into the central nervous system (CNS) myelin is contributed by astrocyte-specific inactivation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage- activating protein (SCAP) and lipid biosynthesis, which resulted in a significantly retarded CNS myelin. Importantly, the embryonic deletion of a gene in the gene of astrocetes, which is essential for myelin synthesis, caused persistent hypomyelination, whereas the deletion of the gene in astrolytes was sufficient to rescue myelin in conditional mouse mutants. Thus, we conclude that lipid synthesis is a major feature of myelin formation in the CNS."

Freshly made proteins are typically long, structure-less chains of peptides, but shortly afterwards most of them fold into characteristic structures. Proteins execute many functions in the cell, for which they need to have the right structure, which is therefore very important in determining what the proteins can do. The structure of a protein can be determined by X-ray diffraction and other experimental approaches which are all, to this day, somewhat labor-intensive and difficult. On the other hand, the order of the peptides in a protein can be read off from the DNA blue-print, and such protein sequences are today routinely produced in large numbers. In this paper we show that many similar protein sequences can be used to find information about the structure. The basic approach is to construct a probabilistic model for sequence variability, and then to use the parameters of that model to predict structure in three-dimensional space. The main technical novelty compared to previous contributions in the same general direction is that we use models more directly matched to the data.","Correlation patterns of multiple sequence alignments between homologous proteins are exploited to infer information-dimensional structure of members. To address this task, we refer to dimensions as contact prediction, (i) filter and align raw sequence data representing evolutionarily related proteins; (ii) choose a predictive model to describe sequence alignment; (iii) infer model parameters to interpret terms of structural properties, and (iv) make an accurate contact map. The dimensions are important for the overall prediction success. In particular, it is possible to improve significantly the second dimension by going pair-wise with Potts models of statistical physics, a hitherto focus field in this field. These extensions are motivated by multiple sequences alignments containing long stretches of gaps, a data feature, and untypical independent samples drawn from the Potts model. A large test set of proteins combined with improvements in dimensions to a large reported date."

Since effective prevention is not available currently and the non-specific symptoms at the early stage of the disease always lead to the delay of visiting to hospital or misdiagnosis, alternative vaccinations against HTNV are of priority to overcome the problem. We defined five novel HTNV nucleoprotein CD8+ T-cell epitopes restricted by the most popular HLA alleles in Chinese Han population. For the first time, we quantitated the HTNV epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell frequency during HTNV infection and evaluated the correlations between the CD8+ T-cell response and the different outcomes of the HFRS severity. We also found that effective HTNV nucleoprotein epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were characterized by the interferon-γ secretion with a strong capacity of activation and proliferation. Our results add weight to understanding the important role of epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the disease control after acute zoonotic HTNV infections in humans and provide a rationale foundation to speed up the process of peptide vaccine development.","Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection in humans is a public health concern in Asia. The potent T cell activation peptide vaccine HTNV structure protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control. However, the role of epitope-specific T cell response in HTNV infection remain largely unexplored. Here, we have identified novel CD8+ T-cell epitopes in the HTNV nucleoprotein restricted to popular HLA alleles in the Chinese Han population and defined an interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay in 37 patients infected with HTNV hospitalization. The epitopes aa129–aa137 and aa131-aa139 were restricted to HLA-A2 B35, respectively, and were selected to evaluate the frequency and severity of the T cell responses in patients with acute stage disease. We found that the frequency of a single epitope specific CD8 + T cell was significantly associated with the peak level of serum creatinine and positively associated with nadir platelet counts during hospitalization and hospitalization, and the intracellular cytokine staining proliferation assay showed that effective epitope–specific CD8-T cell responses were characterized by production of interfon-γ, expression of CD69, and strong capacity to proliferation. The novel HLA class restricted to the HLA gene restricted to HTNV has a novel role in epitope specificity and CD8–T-cell responses closely related to the progression of disease and severity in humans."

The Guinean government and his partners are conducting HAT control activities to reduce the burden of this neglected tropical disease and, as set-up by WHO, to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020. Unfortunately, control efforts were deeply impaired during the Ebola outbreak that stroke the country in 2014–15. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of this unprecedented outbreak on HAT screening and caring activities. A major impact was the interruption of all active screening activities which aim, in addition of detecting and treating patients, is to clear the human reservoir of parasite and decrease transmission. Passive surveillance and diagnosis were also severely affected due to the fear of the population to come to the endemic district confirmation and treatment facilities and to the progressive banning of using rapid test in peripheral health structures, as well as the requisition of healthcare workers and facilities for the fight against Ebola. As a consequence, only 59 HAT patients were diagnosed and treated during the Ebola outbreak (from January 2014 to October 2015) as compared to 154 before the outbreak (from February 2012 to December 2013). This potentially high number of undiagnosed human reservoir of trypanosomes may have contributed in turn to increase transmission levels. A rapid revival of HAT control activities in Guinea is thus vital in order to stay in line with the 2020 elimination goal and to avoid possible bursts of the disease.","The 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak massively hit Guinea. The coastal districts of Boffa, Dubreka and Forecariah, major foci of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), were particularly affected. We aimed to assess the impact of epidemic sleeping sickness screening and caring activities on HAT burden in Guinea. We used preexisting data from the Guinean sleeping sickness control program, collected between 2012 and 2015. We compared the number of persons screened actively; (i) passively; (iii) treated with HAT; and (iv) attending post-treatment follow-up visits. We found that the proportion of persons who were actively screened during the Ebola outbreak decreased by 44% compared to the pre-Ebola period. Active screening campaigns were stopped in early 2014. The number of people tested passively per month increased from 7 286 April September 2014 to 180 January 2015 March 2015. The proportion of patients who initiated HAT treatment, 154 (72%) Ebola, and 59 (28%) Ebola outbreak cases were recruited for passive screening. We also found that patients who were recruited to passive screening were diagnosed with later stage 2 disease (96% vs. 55% Ebola, p<0.0001). Active screening activities were stopped. Passive screening dramatically decreased in the Ebola period, and retention rates were lower than those of the pre–Eebola period (data available). The drop in newly diagnosed HAT cases was unlikely to fall in HAT incidence. We were unable demonstrate directly, probably in consequence of hampered screening activities and fear of the population subsequent confirmation of linkage care. Reinforced program monitoring, alternative control strategies and sustainable financial and human resources allocation should be mandatory for the post-Ebo period."

The cause of schizophrenia is unknown, but there is extensive evidence that genetics play a significant role in its aetiology. We studied the genetic basis of schizophrenia by analyzing around 500,000 genetic variants distributed across the whole human genome in DNA from schizophrenic patients and controls. We analyzed separately the DNA from men and women, and identified a genetic variant that increases the risk of developing schizophrenia in women only. The genetic variant is estimated to increase the risk of schizophrenia for women carrying the risk variant by 1.4-fold. The genetic variant is in a gene called reelin, which is known to play a part in brain development. However, it is still unclear how this genetic variant predisposes to schizophrenia nor why it is specific to women only.","Sex differences in schizophrenia are known, but the genetic basis has not been identified. We performed a genome-wide association scan of schizophrenia in the Ashkenazi Jewish population using DNA pooling. We found a female-specific association with rs7341475, the SNP of the fourth intron reelin ( RELN) gene (p = 2.9 × 10−5 women) and a significant gene-sex effect (p= 1.8 × 10–4). We studied rs7351475 in additional populations, totaling 2,274 cases and 4,401 controls. We also found a significant effect observed in women, replicating the initial result (p<2.1 × 10+3 women; p = 4.2 × 10-3 gene- sex interaction). Based on these populations, we estimated the relative risk of women carrying a common genotype 1.58 (p <8.8×10−7; p= 1.) and a gene-Sex interaction (p >1.6 × 10.5). Our findings suggest that the female-associated association with RELN in schizophrenia is not replicated in sex-specific genetic association with disease."

Treatment of such infections is hampered by the limited number of suitable antimycotics. Therefore, understanding how this fungus causes disease is crucial for the development of more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies. Here we identified a novel C. albicans transporter that has no human homologue and demonstrate its role during multiple stages of candidiasis. We also show that this transporter is involved in modifying environmental pH and in filamentous growth. Additionally, deletion of DUR31 rendered cells unable to assimilate a polyamine (spermidine) as a nutrient source, but resistant to the antimicrobial peptide histatin 5. Therefore, Dur31 has multiple transport functions, which can be either beneficial or detrimental to the fungus.","Candida albicans is the most frequent cause of oral fungal infections in humans. However, the exact pathogenicity mechanisms of the fungus employs largely unknown genes expressed during oral infection are uncharacterized. In this study, we sought to functionally characterize 12 previously unknown function genes associated with oral candidiasis. We generated homozygous knockout mutants of 12 genes and analyzed their interaction with the human oral epithelium in vitro. We found that deletion of orf19.6656 (DUR31) elicited the strongest reduction in pathogenogenicity. Interestingly, DUR31 was involved in oral epithelial damage, multiple stages of candidiasis, including surviving attack by human neutrophils, endothelial damage in vivo, and virulence in vivo. Our silico analysis indicated that Dur31 encodes a sodium/substrate symporter and 13 transmembrane domains in the human homologue. We provide evidence that Dur31 transports histatin 5, a highly cytotoxic antimicrobial peptide. In contrast, in wild type C. albican, dur31Δ/ Δ is unable to actively increase local environmental pH, suggesting that the activity of Dur31 lies in the extracellular alkalinization and hyphal auto-induction pathway. In agreement with this observation, we find that dur31 Δ/ Δ cannot assimilate polyamine spermidine."

This process is controlled by the action of several molecules that maintain cell type specific programs in response to cytokines, antigen recognition and the direct contact with T helper cells, forming a complex regulatory network. While there is a large body of experimental data regarding some of the key molecules involved in this process and there have been several efforts to reconstruct the underlying regulatory network, a general consensus about the structure and dynamical behavior of this network is lacking. Moreover, it is not well understood how this network controls the establishment of specific B cell expression patterns and how it responds to specific external signals. We present a model of the regulatory network controlling terminal B cell differentiation and analyze its dynamical behavior under normal and mutant conditions. The model recovers the patterns of differentiation of B cells and describes a large set of gain- and loss-of-function mutants. This model provides an unified framework to generate qualitative descriptions to interpret the role of intra- and extracellular regulators of B cell differentiation.","In vertebrates, terminal differentiation of B cells is an essential process of the humoral immune response. This process is achieved by concerted action of transcription factors in response to antigen recognition and extracellular signals provided by T- helper cells. Although there is a wealth of experimental data on the molecular cellular signals involved in this process, the general consensus is that the dynamical properties of the regulatory network controlling this process are not well understood. We developed a dynamical model of the network controlling terminal differentiation in B cells. We show that the structure of the model can be inferred from experimental data and the available literature, and that dynamical behavior can be analyzed by modeling the network in discrete continuous dynamical systems. Our models are consistent with patterns of activation reported in Naive, GC, Mem, and PC cell types. We also show that these models are able to describe patterns of differentiation in precursor cells of Naive and GC, and Mem, PC cells of the response to a specific set of cellular signals. We simulated possible single loss-gain-of-function mutants, corroborating the importance of Pax5, Bcl6, Bach2, Irf4, and Blimp1 as key regulators of the B cell differentiation process.

The Western diet has been implicated as an important factor, though the mechanisms by which high levels of dietary sugar and fat contribute to heart failure remain controversial. Here, we use the fruit fly Drosophila to explore the role of diet on progressive heart failure. We show that elevated levels of dietary sugar are sufficient to direct progressive heart failure in flies including arrhythmia, reduced fractional shortening, and aspects of fibrosis. We demonstrate the importance of multiple cellular pathways, including the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, as important for mediating these progressive defects, suggesting a potential avenue towards therapeutics.","Diets with high carbohydrates have long been linked to progressive heart dysfunction, but the mechanisms by which chronic high sugar leads to heart failure remain poorly understood.

Initially, germ cells contain two copies of each chromosome, one from the mother and one from the father, which are called homologs. During meiosis, cells divide twice to produce haploid gametes with only one copy of each chromosome. Each gamete receives exactly one copy of each chromosome, because homologs become associated, through a process called meiotic pairing, and then segregate from each other during the first round of division. In Drosophila, it was assumed that homologs were always paired in every cell type. Meiotic pairing was thus viewed as an extension of a pre-existing pairing. Here, we show that chromosomes II and III are not paired in germline stem cells, which produce germ cells throughout adult life. We further show that these chromosomes become paired during the four rounds of mitosis preceding the entry in meiosis. Surprisingly, meiotic proteins are expressed during these four rounds of mitosis and are required for homologs to pair. Our results thus show that, in Drosophila, meiosis starts during the preceding mitosis.","Mitosis and meiosis are distinct cell division programs. During meiosis, sister chromatids separate, meiotic division, and homologous chromosomes pair to segregate. In most organisms, germ cells programs sequentially, amplify mitosis, switching meiosis to produce haploid gametes. However, autosomal chromosomes are unpaired centromeres in Drosophila germline stem cells, paired following mitosis. Surprisingly, we show that components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex, expressed in the mitotic region of ovaries, localize close to centromres, and promote de novo association with centromere. These results demonstrate that the meiotic proteins and meiotic organization of centomeres, key features that ensure reductional segregation, are laid by amplifying germ cells, and that meiosis started."

However, tracking of cells in which Yop injection occurred has only been described for Yersinia pestis thus far. We adapted the described reporter system specifically for the use of infections with Ye and report the usefulness and limitations of this system. Using cell culture experiments, we demonstrated that β1-integrins and the RhoGTPases RhoA and Rac1 are involved in Yop injection. Since cell culture experiments also revealed that Yop injection is detectable in a similar manner into all subpopulations of the spleen, the system can be used to detect interaction of bacteria with host cells in vivo. In a mouse infection model we found that follicular B cells, granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are the main targets of Yop injection. Interestingly, Yop-injected B cells displayed an increased activation as indicated by increased CD69 expression. In contrast, interaction of bacteria with T cells seems to be rather a rare event.

The occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fever is thought to result from a complex interplay between the virus, host genetics and host immune factors. Patients with more severe clinical disease have been shown to have higher serum IL-10 levels and IL-10 has also been shown to be associated with poorer disease outcome in other viral infections. Therefore, in this study, we proceeded to investigate the role of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of dengue infections and its effect on DENV-specific T cells. We found that both DENV- serotype-specific (SS) specific T cell responses and DENV-NS3 specific responses were impaired in patients with higher serum IL-10 levels. Serum IL-10 levels did not appear to have any effect on non dengue viral protein specific responses. IL-10 blockade significantly increased IFNγ production, in response to DENV-NS3 peptides but not to non dengue viral proteins in acute dengue infection. Therefore, our results suggest that IL-10 could be contributing to disease pathogenesis by inhibiting DENV-specific T cell responses.","Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of severe dengue infection (DI) in Sri Lanka.

Although blood is a natural food source for these insects, its digestion releases toxic products, which poses a dietary challenge for both triatomine insects and trypanosomes. To overcome this, triatomines eliminate these toxic blood products by a unique process of heme crystallization into hemozoin that take place in their digestive tract. Here we describe that this detoxification process represents the major mechanism for redox balance control, and is necessary to allow triatomine insect reproduction, and Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Disruption of heme crystallization in triatomine insects thus represents a new venue for Chagas disease control, by targeting at the same time insect reproduction and parasite transmission.","Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to humans through the blood feeding of triatomine insect vectors.

Adequate laboratory diagnostic methods become necessary. The diagnostic method that proves infection caused by Brucella spp. is the isolation of the bacteria from body fluids or tissues, but the difficulty in obtaining positive bacterial cultures has led to the development of other diagnostic techniques. Rose Bengal test, Wright agglutination, Coombs antibrucella, immunocapture techniques, and serology to detect specific IgG and IgM antibodies usually by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are the serological methods most often used for the diagnosis of brucellosis. The use of ELISA techniques has become widespread in recent years. The detection of specific IgM by using ELISA is considered indicative of acute or recent infection. However, IgM antibody detection in the absence of IgG may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of acute brucellosis. We described a series of patients in which serology detected IgM but not IgG antibrucella antibodies. In these patients the clinical picture and the outcome are not suggestive of active infection caused by Brucella spp. This finding supports the conclusion that Brucella serology data should be interpreted taking into account the patient's clinical history and epidemiological context.","Brucellosis is a parasitic disease caused by the bacterium Brucella.

Encounters between schistosomes and snails do not always result in the snail becoming infected, in part because snails can mount immune responses that prevent schistosome development. Understanding the factors important for snail resistance to schistosome infection will facilitate new lines of investigation to 1) understand the underlying basis of compatibility between schistosomes and snails in endemic areas and how this affects transmission dynamics and control efforts; and 2) to reveal ways to manipulate natural snail populations to enhance their resistance to schistosome infections. Here, we present the first evidence that a snail immune molecule, fibrinogen related protein 3 (FREP3), is important for successful defense against schistosome infections in Biomphalaria snails. In addition, we demonstrate that FREP3 is a target suppressed by trematode parasites to facilitate their establishment within the snail.","Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, is caused by freshwater snails that support the production of prolific numbers of human-infective cercariae. When schistosomes of snails result from being snail infected, snails mount an immune response to prevent the development of the parasite.

FREP3 is a member of a large family of immune molecules with a unique structure consisting of immunoglobulin superfamily domains connected to the fibrininogen domain. To date, only a few of these proteins have been found in gastropod molluscs. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of a specific snail gene, FREP 3, results in a phenotypic loss of resistance to Schistosoma mansoni infection in 15 70 (21.4%) snails resistant to BS-90 strain Biomphalaria glabrata infection.

In this paper, we describe a pioneering attempt to establish a therapeutic community for patients suffering from BU and chronic ulcers requiring long term hospital care in Benin. The project was designed and implemented by a team of social scientists working in concert with the current previous director of the hospital. Qualitative research initially investigated patients’ understanding of illness and treatment, identified questions about their treatment status after hospitalization, ascertained the level of social support and developed a series of open forums.

This experiment has been repeated on many organisms and is the gold standard for extending lifespan. While we are beginning to understand how calorie restriction regulates lifespan, the mechanisms are complex and much remains to be learned. In the work presented here, we demonstrate a novel way to increase lifespan in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our strategy is to lower the rate of sphingolipid synthesis either by reducing the synthesis of the first enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway or by using a drug to reduce enzyme activity. This strategy works in part by lowering the activity of a protein kinase, termed Sch9 in yeast and S6K in mammals, both of which are involved in the processes affected by calorie restriction and that control lifespan. In addition, we find that reducing sphingolipid synthesis increases lifespan in ways that are independent of Sch9 and calorie restriction. Since sphingolipids are found in all eukaryotes, our results suggest that pharmacological down-regulation of one or more sphingolipids may provide a means to reduce age-related diseases and increase lifespan in other eukaryotes.","Sphingolipids, a protein kinase that regulates lifespan, have been shown to mediate many aspects of lifespan. However, the mechanisms by which they regulate lifespan are not well understood. Here, we reveal a novel approach for regulating lifespan. Using a genetic pharmacological strategy to lower the rate of sphingolipopid synthesis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells live longer. We show that a longer lifespan arises from the reduction of Sch9 protein kinases activity and consequent reduction of chromosomal mutations and rearrangements and increased stress resistance. Longer lifespan arises in ways independent from Sch9 caloric restriction, and we speculate ways that sphingolsipids mediate aspects of increased lifespan. We demonstrate that Sch9 and its mammalian homolog S6 kinase work downstream of the target of rapamycin, TOR1, and other stress signals. These data establish Sch9 as a focal point of regulating lifespan integrating nutrient signals with TOR1 growth and stress signals, and suggest that this pharmacological-regulation strategy may provide a means to reduce age-related diseases that increase lifespan in eukaryotes."

However, introns comprise about half of the human non-coding genome and they can have important regulatory roles. We show that deletions of intronic regions appear more frequent than previously expected in the healthy population, with a significant proportion of genes with evolutionary ancient and essential functions carrying them. This finding was very surprising, as ancient genes tend to have high conservation of their coding sequence. However, we show that deletions of their non-coding intronic sequence can produce considerable changes in their locus length. We found that a significant number of these intronic deletions are associated with under- or over-expression of the affected genes or distant genes interacting in 3D. Our data suggests that the frequent gene length variation in protein-coding genes resulting from intronic CNVs might influence their regulation in different individuals.","Introns play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in humans. However, little is known about population patterns of structural variation and its functional implication. By combining extensive maps of CNVs in human populations, we found that intronic losses are associated with significant differences in gene expression levels in human, 12,986 intronic deletions, affecting 4,147 genes (including 1,154 essential genes and 1,638 disease-related genes). Intronic length variation results in dozens of genes showing extreme population variability in size, 40 genes with 10 different sizes and 150 allelic sizes. Intronic loss is associated with frequent evolutionarily ancient genes that are highly conserved at the protein sequence level. These results contrasts with losses of overlapping exons, which were observed to be unlikely to exclusively affect primate-specific genes. We integrated the CNVs with RNA-seq data and showed that the intronic loss was associated with significantly differences in expression levels of the population (CNV-eQTLs). Intron enhancers were associated with expression differences in genes showing long distance intron-receptor 3D interactions. These data suggest that intrronic structural variation in protein-coding genes makes an important contribution to variability and gene expression splicing across human populations."

This is particularly critical for identifying degraded input. However, the underlying neural mechanism by which expectations influence sensory processing is unclear. Predictive Coding theories suggest that the brain passes forward the unexpected part of the sensory input while expected properties are suppressed (i.e., Prediction Error). However, evidence to rule out the opposite mechanism in which the expected part of the sensory input is enhanced or sharpened (i.e., Sharpening) has been lacking. In this study, we investigate the neural mechanisms by which sensory clarity and prior knowledge influence the perception of degraded speech. A univariate measure of brain activity obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is in line with both neural mechanisms (Prediction Error and Sharpening). However, combining multivariate fMRI measures with computational simulations allows us to determine the underlying mechanism. Our key finding was an interaction between sensory input and prior expectations: for unexpected speech, increasing speech clarity increases the amount of information represented in sensory brain areas. In contrast, for speech that matches prior expectations, increasing speech clarity reduces the amount of this information. Our observations are uniquely simulated by a model of speech perception that includes Prediction Errors.","Speech perception depends on combining sensory input with prior knowledge. However, the underlying mechanism by which sources of information are combined is unknown. In speech perception, there are functionally distinct coding schemes proposed by expectations that influence the representation of sensory evidence. Traditional models suggest that expected features of speech input are enhanced by sharpened interactive activation (Sharpened Signals). Conversely, Predictive Coding suggests expected features that are suppressed by unexpected features in speech input (Predict Errors) are processed. We present a new approach aimed at distinguishing accounts of prior knowledge that influence speech perception. By combining behavioural, univariate, and multivariate fMRI measures of sensory detail and prior expectations, we provide evidence to favour Prediction Error computations. Increased sensory detail, informative expectations, and additive behavioural and univariate neural effects improve the accuracy of a word report and reduce BOLD signal in the lateral temporal lobe regions. Our work establishes methods to distinguish representations of Prediction Error and Sharpening Signals in perceptual domains."

Parasitic cysts develop most commonly in the liver and are diagnosed primarily by ultrasound. Serology helps with diagnosis, particularly when ultrasound features are unclear. Unfortunately, in underserved endemic rural areas, expertise in ultrasound diagnosis of CE may be scant, and conventional serology techniques are unavailable due to the lack of laboratory equipment. In these circumstances, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) may be very useful. In this work, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of three RDTs and compared them with a commercial ELISA test routinely used in our diagnostic laboratory. Our results show that RDTs have overall comparable performances to ELISA in the diagnosis of hepatic CE in well-defined stages, although significant differences exist among them. If confirmed and expanded on a bigger cohort, these results would support the use of RDTs instead of conventional techniques to complement imaging in the diagnosis of CE.","Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease caused by the bacterium Echinococcus dengue. The diagnosis of CE is based primarily on imaging, in particular ultrasound abdominal CE, complemented by serology imaging results. However, in rural endemic areas, the expertise of ultrasound is scant and conventional serology techniques are unavailable. Therefore, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) are appealing. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of 3 commercial RDTs for diagnosis of hepatic CE. Sera from 59 patients with single hepatocellular CE cysts-defined ultrasound stages (gold standard) and 25 patients with non-parasitic cysts were analyzed using three RDT: VIRapid, HYDATIDOSIS (VIRcell, Spain), and ADAMU-CE (ICST, Japan). Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves were compared to McNemar t-test. Virapid and DIGFA were significantly more sensitive to diagnosis of active cysts (p = 0.019) than ELISA, and the correlation of semiquantitative results with ELISA OD values was evaluated by Spearman coefficient. Reproducibility was good-good. The reproducibility of these tests was also good-for-good, but the reliability of these RDT tests was poor."

As current control seems to be insufficient to bring down the number of cases, there is a need for novel tools to interrupt transmission. A diagnostic that permitted diagnosis of subclinical cases will likely be fundamental to achieve elimination and ultimately eradication. In this study we assessed the minimum sensitivity level of such a (hypothetical) diagnostic test and the optimal testing strategy in order to effectively reduce the new case detection rate (NCDR) of leprosy. We showed that a diagnostic test for subclinical leprosy could substantially reduce the NCDR in a high, medium and low endemic population. A significant impact could already be achieved at a test sensitivity level of 50%. To effectively reduce the NCDR in the short run, a population survey is preferred over household contact tracing. However, this is only favorable in high endemic settings, as in medium and low endemic settings testing in a population survey requires many more people to be tested and treated to prevent one new leprosy case.","The availability of a diagnostic test to detect subclinical leprosy cases is crucial to interrupt transmission of M. leprae. In this study, we assessed the minimum sensitivity level of a hypothetical test to determine the optimal testing strategy in order to effectively reduce new case detection rate (NCDR) of leperiasis. We used an individual-based model of SIMCOLEP, based on previous quantification of COLEP data, in a cohort study of over 50,000 cases from Bangladesh. The baseline consisted of treatment with Multidrug therapy, passive case detection and household contact tracing. We examined the use of the leproprosy diagnostic test in subclinical and endemic settings. We found that the test sensitivity of 50% was significantly lower in the endemic setting compared to the test strategy. This reduction was achieved by test sensitivity low 50% in the high endemic setting. In the low endemic setting, test sensitivity was high 50% and the population survey was preferred for household contact testing. The population survey yield the highest number of prevented new cases, requires a large number of needed test to treat and requires a substantially lower number of tests needed to test treat."

Immune responses targeting the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of V. cholerae are involved in mediating protection against cholera. Evidence suggests that inactivated whole-cell oral cholera vaccine (OCV) that includes killed V. cholerae O1 and O139 organisms provides protection against cholera caused by V. cholerae O1, but the immune correlates of this protection are not fully defined. In this study, we specifically assessed induction of immune responses targeting V. cholerae O1 OSP following vaccination with the OCV in adults in a cholera endemic area, Bangladesh. Our results show that OCV induces serum, mucosal and memory anti-OSP responses, and that these responses are maximal following the first dose of vaccination, without evident boosting with the second dose. This result calls into question the day 0 and day 14 two dose regimen currently used among adults in a cholera-endemic zone.","Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) containing killed Vibrio cholerae and O1 O139 organisms (Bivalent-OCV; Biv- OCV) is playing a central role in the global control of the disease. OCV is currently administered as a 2-dose regimen (day 0 and 14) and there is growing body evidence that immune responses targeting O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) V. cholera mediate protection against choleremia. However, there is limited data on anti-OSP responses in recipients of Biv and OCV. We assessed serum antibody responses against O1 and OSP, antibody secreting cell (ASC) responses (a surrogate marker of mucosal immunity) and memory B cell responses in blood of adult recipients of OSP in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Serum antibody responses were largely IgA and minimal IgG IgM responses in the population. We found no evidence of IgA or IgG memory responses on day 7 following vaccination, and that IgG and IgG responses were detectable 30 days after completion of the second immunization. Protective efficacy extends to a month after vaccination, presumably mediated by a direct mucosal immune response. Our results suggest that a single dose of OCV in adults in a Cholera endemic zone may be sufficient to mediate short-term protection."

The intensive cultivation particularly of clonally propagated crop plants increases the potential for the emergence and rapid spread of new diseases. Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae was first reported as a canker-causing pathogen of kiwifruit in the mid-1980s. However, a new outbreak of the disease occurred in 2008 and this strain has spread rapidly throughout growing regions of the world. In order to determine the origin, population structure and defining features of this pathogen, a large-scale sequencing project was established. This clarified the phylogenetic relationships between the different Psa isolates and identified the outbreak-specific gene sets associated with the aggressive systemic infection strategy exhibited by the virulent strain. This information is invaluable in developing robust long-term solutions for this serious disease. Given that kiwifruit production on a commercial scale is a relatively recent event, this analysis provides a unique insight into the evolution of this pathogen with its host, from its first emergence to the latest global outbreak. This understanding should aid in the mitigation of devastating outbreaks in the future.","Many crop diseases are linked to domestication of plants. However, most crops have been domesticated centuries – millennia – ago, limiting the opportunity to understand the concomitant emergence of disease. Kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) is an exception: domestication began in the 1930s and outbreaks of canker disease caused by P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) were recorded in the 1980s. Based on SNP analyses circularized 34 draft genomes, Psa comprised three distinct clades exhibiting negligible-clade diversity, consistent with disease arising from independent samplings of the source population. Three clades correspond to geographical source isolation; the fourth, encompassing the Psa-V lineage responsible for the 2008 outbreak, is globally distributed. In addition, the genomes carry marked signature-pathovar recombination. SNP analysis of the genome reveals hundreds of polymorphisms that reside in the PPHGI-1-like conjugative elements of the evolution of the unlinked core genome. Removal of these SNPs from recombination yields an uninformative (star-like) phylogeny consistent with the diversification of Psa in a single clone years. These findings highlight the importance of a source population as a reservoir for new disease."

Theoretical studies have generated a broad consensus in the field that knowledge of the contact network may help to greatly improve the control of the spread of epidemics. The key problem in the field, however, is that we lack knowledge regarding the actual contact structure underlying real epidemics. Much research is focused on trying to reconstruct actual contact networks in various ways (mobile phone usage data, electronic devices that measure physical proximity, patient interviews, etc). All of these approaches are highly labour intensive and are fraught with many difficulties. Here, we present a new approach which is based on readily available sequence data. Using the Swiss HIV epidemic as an example, we show that it displays strong indications of a underlying contact structure that strongly differs from random interactions, thus undercutting the assumption of random mixing which is commonly made in epidemiological models.","Contact structure is believed to have a large impact on epidemic spreading and consequently the model contact structure continues to gain interest in epidemiology. However, detailed knowledge of the exact contact structure underlying real epidemics is limited. To address this question, we compare phylogenies generated from disease outbreaks generated from simulated populations of different types of contact networks. We find that the shape of phylogenies strongly depends on contact structure. In particular, we measure the tree imbalance to quantify the extent to which the contact structure of the underlying epidemic deviates from the null model contact network. We illustrate the case of random mixing in the Swiss HIV epidemic, where the epidemic was significantly unbalanced than expected by random mixing."

This phenomenon is ubiquitous, as proteins frequently must adapt their behavior to changes in the cellular milieu. The mechanism(s) underlying allostery remains incompletely understood. In particular, predictive models are needed that distinguish amino-acid residues that are critical to allostery, or “hotspots”, from non-hotspots. Here we have used data-mining approaches to infer rules that distinguish hotspots from non-hotspots. Starting with a data set of known hotspot and non-hotspot residues from a diverse set of allosteric proteins, the training data set, we applied machine learning to this data to “learn” models, or sets of rules, for distinguishing hotspots and non-hotspots by inferring associations between the classification (hotspot or non-hotspot) and an associated set of calculated attributes. Many models that showed the highest predictive power on the training data also exhibited high accuracy and sensitivity when applied to an independent data set. Moreover, the pattern of predicted hotspots in the proteins we studied was consistent with known structure/function relationships and previous work suggesting that a network of essential residues mediates the allosteric transition.","Allostery is the binding event of a site protein that modulates its behavior to a distant site. Identifying residues that relay signal to the distant site remains a challenge. We developed predictive models to support vector machines, a widely machine-learning method. The training data set consisted of residues classified into hotspots and non-hotspots based on experimental characterization of point mutations in a diverse set of allosteric proteins. Each residue was associated with a set of calculated features. The sets of features, consisting of dynamical, structural, network, informatic measures, and structural measures, were defined by Daily Gray [1]. The resulting models were performed in an independent data set consisting of hotspots of non-hits and allosterically important residues. The 10 models of Feature Set 1 recalled 68–81% of known hotspots, total hotspot predictions, and 58–67% of actual hotspots. The models were able to predict hotspots in a network of contiguous residues with interior structures, in agreement with previous work."

While this measure has been helpful for characterizing brain states and highlighting alterations of brain dynamics in various diseases, the mechanisms underlying the generation of FC patterns remain poorly understood. One prominent factor shaping FC is the underlying neural network structure. Using a minimalist model of excitation, we investigate how the topology of excitable neural networks contributes to FC. Specifically, we show that FC can be analytically predicted from the way in which the nodes are embedded in the network and how they are related to basic self-organizing units of excitable dynamics, particularly, short pacemaker cycles. These insights are a step towards a mechanistic understanding of the activation patterns of complex neural networks.","The relationship between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) in neural systems is central to brain network science.

We develop an analytical framework describing the contribution of essential topological elements, common inputs to pacemakers, coactivation nodes, and exemplar networks. The present analytic framework will serve as an initial step in mechanistic understanding of the contributions of brain network topology to brain dynamics."

Moreover, we identified an airway epithelial cell line supporting HBoV1 infection, when it was polarized.

Later, during organ formation, tissues may be shaped through polar cell migration. During apoptosis, a neighbouring cell engulfing a cell corpse utilizes polar positional information to deform its cytoskeleton and migrate around the corpse. Wnt pathway signalling is a common mechanism by which cells establish polarity during development, but how a single Wnt signal is translated into different outcomes in different cellular or developmental contexts is not clear. Our data on C. elegans suggest that during diverse directional events—cell engulfment, mitotic spindle movement, and cell migration—different Wnt ligands or a specific signal from a cell corpse signals to the Wnt receptor Frizzled (MOM-5 in C. elegans) and on to the downstream factors CED-10/Rac. But specificity of the Wnt signal is mediated by the use of distinct intermediate signal transduction pathways. Our discovery that this pathway is also used for engulfment of cell corpses led us to propose that the two parallel pathways, originally described for engulfment of corpses, are indeed parts of one pathway involving Wnt pathway components.","The Caenorhabditis elegans Wnt signalling pathway has a wide range of functions in animals, including induction of cell fates and tumours, guidance of cell movements and gastrulation, and induction of cells polarity. However, how Wnt induces polar changes in cellular morphology and remodelling of the cytoskeleton is not well understood. Here, we show that the CED-10/R/12 branch of the Wnt pathway is activated by the MOM-5/Fz receptor, GSK-3 kinase, APC/APC/ APR-1, and activates the Frizzled receptor in C. elegans. Our epistatic analyses suggest that partially redundant signalling pathways defined earlier in engulfment act as a single pathway in early embryos."

In dividing animal cells, microtubules are arranged radially around two centrosomes, promoting the correct distribution of DNA into daughter cells. As cells differentiate, microtubules become organized at non-centrosomal sites, often yielding decentralized microtubule arrays. Although a large body of work has focused on understanding how microtubules are grown from and organized by the centrosome, very little is known about how these activities are performed at non-centrosomal sites. We optimized a technique to degrade proteins in C. elegans differentiated cells, specifically testing the role of essential centrosome proteins in building non-centrosomal microtubules, which emanate from the apical membrane in embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. Surprisingly, we found fundamental differences between the centrosome and membrane, both in the mechanisms that recruit microtubule regulators to each site, and in the proteins that are required to build and organize microtubules. In addition, we found that when fewer microtubules grew from membranes, the remaining microtubules grew faster, suggesting competition for limited materials. Together, our study highlights differences in how centrosomes and membranes grow and organize microtubules, and that multiple pathways contribute membrane-organized microtubules.","Non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs) are found in differentiated cells, but the structures that regulate their organization and dynamics are largely unknown. Here, we use a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of essential centrosomal and microtubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) components in the γ-tubul ring complex in Caenorhabditis elegans and the apical ncMTOC. We found that the centrosome, core of γ -TuRC components, is required for recruitment of all γ–TuRC-dependent microtubules, including MZT-1/MZT1, during the time of animal development. In contrast, we found that only a subset of dynamic microtubulules were specifically required to recruit to apical and apical MTOCs. Surprisingly, microtubular organizing centers are robustly organized in apical or apical NcMToc, despite the loss of GIP-1 and the depletion of known macrotubule regulators, including TPXL-1 / TPX2, ZYG-9/ ch-TOG, PTRN-1, CAMSAP, and NOCA-1. Our results suggest that different microtubula organizing centers may use discrete proteins to function."

The high mutation rate and diversity of HIV strains enables the virus to effectively evade host immune responses, presenting a significant challenge for HIV vaccine design. We have developed an approach to translate clinical databases of HIV sequences into mathematical models quantifying the capacity of the virus to replicate as a function of mutations within its genome. We have previously shown how such “fitness landscapes” can be used to guide the design of vaccines to attack vulnerable regions from which it is difficult for the virus to escape by mutation. Here, using new modeling approaches, we have improved on our previous models of HIV fitness landscape by accounting for undersampling of HIV sequences and the specific identity of mutant amino acids. We experimentally tested the accuracy of the improved models to predict the fitness of HIV with multiple mutations in the Gag protein. The experimental data are in strong agreement with model predictions, supporting the value of these models as a novel approach for determining mutational vulnerabilities of HIV-1, which, in turn, can inform vaccine design.","Viral immune evasion and sequence variation are a major hindrance to HIV-1 vaccine design. To address this challenge, a group developed a computational model, rooted in physics, which aims to predict the fitness landscape of HIV-infected proteins in order to design vaccine immunogens that lead to impaired viral fitness, blocking viable escape routes. In order to address these limitations, we directly test the model predictions in in vitro fitness measurements of HIV strains containing multiple Gag mutations. We incorporated a regularization model fitting procedure to address finite sampling. Our developed model accounts for the specific identity of mutant amino acids (Potts model), generalizing the previous approach (Ising model) and is unable to distinguish between different mutant amino acid sequences. Our results support the ability of computational models to robustly predict relative fitness of mutant viral strains, and indicate a potential value for understanding viral immune evasion, harnessing knowledge of immunogen design."

In this paper, the authors show that the Cyp40-like Cpr7p prolyl isomerase of yeast can effectively inhibit tombusvirus replication. This inhibition is due to binding of the TPR (tetratricopeptide repeats) domain of Cpr7p to the RNA-binding region of the tombusvirus replication proteins that leads to inhibition of RNA binding by the viral replication proteins, interference with the assembly of the viral replicase and blocking viral RNA synthesis. Cpr7p is also effective against the distantly-related alfanodaviruses of insects. Overall, this work reveals a role for a Cyp40-like protein as a regulator of RNA virus replication. This function of Cyp40 during RNA virus infection seems to be conserved between yeast and plants.","Replication of plus-stranded RNA viruses is greatly affected by numerous host-coded proteins acting as susceptibility and resistance factors. Previous genome-wide screens of global proteomics approaches using Tomato bushy stunt tombusvirus (TBSV) in the yeast model host revealed the involvement of cyclophilins, a large family of host prolyl isomerases, in TBSV replication. In this paper, we identified members of the large cyclophilain family that interacted with viral replication proteins and inhibited TbsV replication in vitro. Our characterization of the effective cytoplasmic protein Cyp40-like Cpr7p, revealed that Cyp40 strongly inhibits the steps of viral replication in a cell-free replication assay. These steps include viral RNA recruitment, which inhibited the binding of the CPR7p RNA-binding region to the viral replication protein; assembly of the viral replicase complex; and viral RNA synthesis. Our results suggest that Cyp 40-like proteins are important regulators of TBSv replication."

An imbalanced regulation of the factors contributing to these interactions has negative impacts on the attachment of the fetus, the progression of the pregnancy, and the progeny. Focusing on paired conceptus–endometrium analyses of individual pregnancies in cows, we have determined that communication at implantation encompasses synchronized genome-wide coregulation of genes. Gene regulatory interactions between one conceptus and the surrounding maternal tissue vary between endometrial regions containing or lacking glands. Our data reveal new insights, to our knowledge, on the coordination of molecular mechanisms that contribute to implantation and pregnancy establishment in mammals. We conclude that the biological response of the endometrium is embryo-specific, a phenomenon that deserves further investigation in the context of assisted reproductive technologies.","The embryo and endometrium are essential for the development of the placenta and the progression of pregnancy. However, it remains unclear whether the interactions between the conceptus and the endometria are coordinated at the level of individual pregnancy. To test the hypothesis that gene expression in the embryo is dependent on the gene expression of extraembryonic tissues, we performed integrative analysis of transcriptome profiles paired with extraEmbryonic tissue from pregnancies initiated by artificial insemination. We quantified strong dependence ( |r| > 0.95, empirical false discovery rate [eFDR] < 0.01) on the transcript abundance of genes expressed in the endostrium and the coexpression patterns of genes in the caruncular and intercaruncular areas of the ectopic embryo. We found that the coexpressing modules were remarkably specific to the caruuncular intercuncular area of the endoembryrium.

These structural changes occur both in normal and in cancerous cells and are thought to cause both benign and deleterious changes in cell function. Many of these structural alterations are generated when two dispersed repeated DNA sequences at non-allelic sites recombine during non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Here we study NAHR on a genome-wide scale using the experimentally tractable budding yeast as a eukaryotic model genome with its fully sequenced family of repeated DNA elements, the Ty retrotransposons. With our novel system, we simultaneously measure the effects of known recombination parameters on the frequency of NAHR to understand which parameters most influence the occurrence of rearrangements between repetitive sequences. These findings provide a basic framework for interpreting how structural changes observed in the human genome may have arisen.","Genome rearrangements result from non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between repetitive DNA elements dispersed throughout the genome. In this study, we systematically analyze the NAHR of Ty retrotransposons in a genome-wide approach that exploits unique features of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purebred S. bayanus hybrid diploids. We find that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induce NAHR–dependent rearrangement of Ty elements located at 12 48 kilobases at the distal break site. We also find that the break-distal recombination pathway is frequently used to repair a break in a Ty homolog. Robust BDR–dependent NAHR demonstrates that sequences of distal DSBs can effectively compete with the proximal sequences of the repair break.

Hox transcription factors specify different cell fates by regulating the expression of downstream genes, many of which are part of cell signaling pathways. For example, a Hox factor that is only expressed in the Drosophila abdomen (Abdominal-A) activates the release of a signaling molecule (Epidermal Growth Factor, EGF) from a specific neural precursor cell. The cells that receive the signal are induced to become essential hepatocyte-like cells required for metabolism and animal growth. Here, we show that this same Hox factor is not only required for sending the EGF signal, but it also enhances the strength of the signal within the developing hepatocyte-like cells. Importantly, the thoracic Hox factor fails to both induce and enhance the signal, thereby providing a better understanding of how these abdomen-specific cells are generated and distinct morphological structures become regionalized to specific segments of the embryo.","Hox transcription factors specify distinct cell types on the anterior-posterior axis of metazoans by regulating target genes and modulating signaling pathways.

The fruit fly is a powerful model for studying the mechanisms of development, health and disease and is also used to study social behaviors such as mating and aggression. However, these studies are limited to examining few individuals for shorts amounts of time, due to the lack of effective computational tools for the analysis of large groups over prolonged time. To overcome this hurdle, we built a new behavioral arena and developed new software that accurately tracks many flies simultaneously over long time periods. The arena is cheap and easy to build and the software works with low resolution videos. Using these improved tools, we studied social isolation in groups of male flies. We found that isolation caused flies to form stronger interactions with neighboring flies in their social network. These behavioral changes were preceded by transient changes in the expression of metabolism genes and eventually resulted in isolated flies accumulating fat, as has been previously observed in studies in mice and humans. Our study opens the door for the use of fruit flies in future studies of social isolation.","Isolation profoundly influences social behavior in animals.

In many bacterial pathogens, the type III secretion system is used to inject these virulence factors directly to the cytoplasm of the host cell. The secreted proteins do not have well-conserved sequences and do not have any kind of common identifiable signal sequence to target them for secretion. This makes it very difficult to identify secreted proteins of this kind without experimental investigation, as can be done in other secretion systems. In this study, we develop a computational approach to detect secreted virulence factors from genomic protein sequences. We use this method to compare the N-terminal regions of proteins from S. Typhimurium and a plant pathogen, P. syringae, and show that this approach is the most effective method of computational identification of type III secreted proteins to date. We further use this approach to identify a sequence pattern in these proteins that presumably helps direct virulence proteins to the type III secretion apparatus. We provide novel predictions of secreted proteins in these two organisms, as well as in the human pathogen C. trachomatis. Better understanding of secreted virulence factors in pathogens will lead to new ways of combating important infectious diseases and provide understanding of the complex interaction between pathogen and host.","The type III secretion system is an essential component of virulence of Gram-negative bacteria.

The movement (extravasation) of leukocytes from the bloodstream to the surrounding tissue is a prerequisite for proper host defense. Platelets are anucleate cell particles that circulate in the blood and play a fundamental role in hemostasis. Here, we report a previously unrecognized function of platelets as ""pathfinders"" guiding leukocytes to their site of extravasation. Upon onset of the inflammatory response, platelets were found to immediately adhere to specific sites in the smallest venular microvessels. At these ""hot spots"", platelets capture intravascularly crawling neutrophils and, in turn, inflammatory monocytes. The cellular crosstalk arising from these interactions leads to conformational changes of distinct adhesion molecules on the surface of leukocytes, subsequently promoting the extravasation of these immune cells to the inflamed tissue. Conversely, blockade of this cellular partnership leads to misguided and inefficient leukocyte responses. Thus, platelet-directed guidance of leukocytes to confined sites of extravasation appears to be a critical step in the recruitment process of immune cells, which might emerge as a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory pathologies.","Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The immune response to an infection requires the migration of leukocytes from the vasculature to the site of injury. However, how immune cells “find” the “right” site of extravasation remains largely obscure. Here, we identified previously unrecognized roles of platelets as pathfinders guiding leukocyte exit points from the microvasculature: onset of inflammation, circulating platelets are found to immediately adhere to distinct sites of venular microvessels enabling cellular blood components to capture neutrophils, in turn, inflammatory monocytes and CD40-CD40L-dependent interactions. We found that cellular crosstalk, ligation of PSGL-1 and P-selectin leads to ERK1/2 and MAPK-dependent conformational changes in leukeocyte integrins, which promote successive extravasations of neutrophil and monocytes in perivascular tissue. Conversely, blockade of cellular partnership resulted in misguided, inefficient leukocyocyte responses. Our experimental data uncover a platelet-directed, spatiotemporally organized, multicellular crostalk that is essential for effective trafficking of Leukocytes to site inflammation."

Furthermore , mouse model provides useful tool gain physiological insight diseases associated defective multicilia .","Lining the airways, brain ventricles, and oviducts, multicilia are small hair-like structures that beat in a whip-like motion to propel fluids, such as mucus, over cell surfaces. Dysfunction of multicilia arising from genetic perturbations is most prominently associated with a devastating disorder called primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a rare genetic disease characterized by hydrocephalus, chronic airway infection, and infertility. Furthermore, defective airway multicilia have been implicated in several respiratory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). While important to human health, the detailed molecular mechanisms of how multiciliated cells develop remain largely unknown. Here, we establish a new mouse model that lacks the key ciliary protein CEP164 in multiciliated cells. These mice recapitulate many symptoms of PCD patients such as hydrocephalus and infertility. We show that, in the absence of CEP164, differentiation of airway multiciliated cells is severely perturbed at multiple steps. Importantly, our data also suggest that CEP164 differentially regulates the proper recruitment of membrane-associated ciliary proteins. In summary, we have developed a powerful mouse model to study diseases affecting multicilia and shed light on novel roles of CEP164 in multiciliogenesis.","Multiciliated cells provide a motive force for mucociliary clearance, cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and ovum transport. Despite the clear importance of human biology and health, the molecular mechanisms underlying multiciliated cell differentiation are poorly understood. Prior studies implicate the distal appendage/transformation fiber protein CEP164 as a central regulator of primary ciliogenesis; however, the role of multiciliogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we generated a conditional mouse model of multiciliated cells in the testis. We found that multicilia have profound loss of airway, ependymal, oviduct and multicilia and develop hydrocephalus and male infertility. Furthermore, we found that Cep164 is required for proper recruitment of small vesicles, ciliary vesicle formation, basal body docking, and ciliary motility. In addition, we show that cEP164 is necessary for the proper recruitment and recruitment of distal and transition fiber protein Chibby1 (Cby1) and its binding partners FAM92A and FAM92B to the ciliary base. These findings provide a useful tool to gain physiological insight into diseases associated with defective multicilia."

Until now, little was known about whether proteins aggregate in a non-disease context. In this study, we discovered that the aging process itself, in the absence of disease, leads to the insolubilization and increased aggregation propensity of several hundred proteins in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. These aggregation-prone proteins have distinct structural and functional proprieties. We asked if this inherent age-dependent protein aggregation impacts neurodegenerative diseases. We found that proteins similar to those aggregating in old worms have also been identified as minor components of human disease aggregates. In addition, we showed that higher levels of inherent protein aggregation aggravated toxicity in a C. elegans Huntington's disease model. Inherent protein aggregation is a new biomarker of aging. Understanding how to modulate it will lead to important insights into the mechanisms that underlie aging and protein aggregation diseases.","Aberrant protein aggregation is a hallmark of age-related diseases, but little is known about how proteins aggregate age in a non-disease setting. Using a systematic proteomics approach, we identified proteins that are insoluble in age in the multicellular organism Caenorhabditis elegans. These proteins were predicted to be significantly enriched in β- sheets, which promote disease protein aggregation. Strikingly, these proteins were highly-represented in aggregates found in human neurodegeneration. We examined proteins in vivo and confirmed their propensity to aggregate age. Different proteins were aggregated in different tissues and cellular compartments. Protein insolubility aggregation was significantly delayed by reduced insulin/IGF-1- signaling, which slows aging. We found that the overlap between proteins and insoluble proteins may influence lifespan and/or polyglutamine-repeat aggregation. We also found that overexpressing an aggregating protein enhanced the pathology of polyglucamine- repeat pathology. These findings indicate that widespread protein insoluble aggregation is inherent to aging and may influence the lifespan of neurodegenative disease."

Identification of “promising” target sites is therefore of importance for any pathogen. This crucial step of the infection is still poorly understood. Here, we have studied target site selection by the flagellated Gram-negative gut pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium. Using a well-established tissue culture model system, we found that flagella-driven motility forces the bacterium into a “near surface swimming” mode which facilitates “scanning” of the host cell surface. The near surface swimming was found to target the pathogen towards sites with particular topological features, i.e., rounded cells and membrane ruffles. This explains how S. Typhimurium “identifies” particular target sites and infects membrane ruffles in a cooperative manner. Interestingly, the near surface swimming is attributable to generic physical principles acting on moving particles. Therefore, our findings might be of general importance for the infection by motile pathogens.","S. Typhimurium is an enteropathogenic bacterium that causes a wide range of infections in humans and animals. In this study, we analyzed the target-site selection of S. Typhimerium by tissue culture, time lapse microscopy, and movement pattern analysis modeling. We found that the target site selection is dependent on the host cell surface motility (chemotaxis). Flagellar motility is required for the pathogen to reach the host cells surface in vitro. Subsequently, physical forces were trapped by the bacterium at ∼1.5–3 s “near surface swimming”. This increased local pathogen density facilitated “scanning” host surface topology. We observed transient TTSS-1 fim-independent “ stopping” irreversible TTSs-1-mediated docking, and particular sites with prominent topology, i.e. base rounded-cells and membrane ruffles. Our data indicate that target site-selection is cooperative with the infection of membrane ruffsles attributable to near surface swimming."

Here we demonstrate that prions can be transmitted through aerosols in mice. This also occurs in the absence of immune cells as demonstrated by experiments with mice lacking B-, T-, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), lymphotoxin signaling or with complement-deficient mice. Therefore, a functionally intact immune system is not strictly needed for aerogenic prion infection. These results suggest that current biosafety guidelines applied in diagnostic and scientific laboratories ought to include prion aerosols as a potential vector for prion infection.","Prions, agents causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, colonize the brain through oral, parenteral, intralingual, and transdermal uptake. However, prions are generally considered airborne. Here, we report that inbred crossbred wild-type mice, tga20 transgenic mice, overexpressing PrPC, efficiently develop scrapie exposure from aerosolized prions. We show that the NSE-PrP transgenic mouse, which express PrPC selectively in neurons, is more susceptible to airborne prions than the uninfected mice. Aerogenic infection occurred in mice lacking B- T- lymphocytes, NK-cells, follicular dendritic cells, and complement components. Brains of diseased mice contained PrPSc transmitted to scrapie inoculated mice. We conclude that aerogenic exposure to prions is efficacious and can lead to direct invasion of neural pathways and the obligatory replicative phase of lymphoid organs.

In this study, we aimed to systematically characterize peptidase activity in different developmental stages of the parasite. We used a library of diverse tetradecapeptides incubated in cellular lysates of adult worms-stage larvae (L1) and cleaved peptide products identified by mass spectrometry. Lysates were treated with class specific peptidases inhibitors to determine the enzyme class responsible for proteolytic activity. We found that proteolysis activity of the major mechanistic classes (aspartic, metallo, and serine cysteine) was detected in adult worm lysate, aspartic and metallo serine-peptidase. In addition, substrate specificity profile was found to vary with different pH values.

The fungus makes a small molecule called gliotoxin which helps A. fumigatus bypass the immune system in ill people, and cause disease. Although a small molecule, gliotoxin biosynthesis is enabled by a complex series of enzymes, one of which is called GliT, in A. fumigatus. Amazingly, nobody has really considered that gliotoxin might be toxic to A. fumigatus itself. Here we show that absence of GliT makes A. fumigatus highly sensitive to added gliotoxin and inhibits fungal growth, both of which can be reversed by restoring GliT. Neither can the fungus make or release its own gliotoxin when GliT is missing. We also show that gliotoxin sensitivity can be totally overcome by adding glutathione, which is an important anti-oxidant within cells. We demonstrate that gliotoxin addition increases the production of GliT, and that GliT breaks the disulphide bond in gliotoxin which may be a step in the pathway for gliotoxin protection or release from A. fumigatus. We conclude that gliotoxin may mainly be involved in protecting A. fumigatus against oxidative stress and that it is an accidental toxin.","Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the most virulent fungi in the world. Gliotoxin is an important component of the virulence arsenal of the fungus, and is encoded by multi-gene clusters of biosynthesized fungi that are non-ribosomal and biosynthetic mechanisms. Although it is universally described in terms of toxicity in mammalian cells, gliotoxin has come to come to be considered a component of its virulent arsenal. In this study, we have deleted a single gene, gliT, from the gliotoxins biosynthesis cluster of A. fumagatus strains, which rendered the organism highly sensitive to exogenous gliototoxin. GliT is expressed in A. nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, and we show that gliTs is primarily responsible for protecting the strain from exogenous Gliotoxoxins. We also show that GliTs exhibits a gliotoxic reductase activity of 9 µM and that glitoxin appears to prevent irreversible depletion of intracellular glutathione stores by the reduction of the oxidized form of gliotiotoxin. Cross-species resistance of exogenous and non-robotoxins acquired from the same species and from A. vesicularis and A. spp., respectively, was transformed by the addition of gliTS. We hypothesise a primary role for gliotin as an antioxidant in addition to its glitoxins and an auto-protective mechanism, deployed by the fungus to protect the potent biomolecule."

However, the relative contribution of each prion protein allotype to the infectious, disease associated form of prion protein (PrPSc) is unknown. Here we report the novel observation that in heterozygous cases of sporadic CJD the PrPSc allotype ratio is highly variable. This case-by-case variability is consistent with the origin of sporadic CJD being the spontaneous, but random, misfolding of either host prion protein allotype into infectious PrPSc. By contrast, in heterozygous cases of iatrogenic CJD in the United Kingdom resulting from exposure to contaminated human growth hormone, the PrPSc allotype ratio is much more homogeneous and consistent with exposure to infectious PrPSc containing valine at residue 129. Surprisingly, the PrPSc allotype ratio did not correlate with disease onset or duration in either disease type. Thus, factors other than PrPSc allotype ratio likely influence the clinical progression of heterozygous cases of CJD. Moreover, our results suggest that the ratio of methionine to valine in PrPSc may be a means of determining the origin of prion infection.","Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is one of the most prevalent human prion diseases, and is caused by infectious prion protein (PrPSc). The origin of sCJD is unknown, and the initiating event is thought to be stochastic misfolding of the endogenous prion proteins (PrPC) by infectious PrPSc. In contrast, human growth hormone-associated cases of iatrogenic CJD (iCJD), in the United Kingdom (UK), are associated with exposure to an exogenous source of prPSc, which is known to cause disease phenotype, onset, and disease duration. However, the relative contribution of PrPC allotype to PrCJD in heterozygous cases of CJD is unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we determined the relative abundance of PrPPSc M V residue 129 in brain specimens of MV cases of the UK. We found that PrPC containing M V and 129 having a similar propensity to misfold PrPsc causing sCsJD. In comparison, PrPSC containing V and 124 predominated in the majority of UK human growth hormones associated with iCJD cases, consistent with exposure of infectious PrPsSc containing V or 129. These results suggest that the factors that influence CJD type, age and clinical onset, disease duration, and clinical progression are important for the clinical progression and phenotype of heterozygozygous and non-homozygous CJD cases."

Gene expression can vary between alleles of an individual through differences in genomic imprinting or cis-acting regulatory variation. Distinguishing allelic activity is important for informing the abundance of altered mRNA and protein products. Advances in sequencing technologies allow us to quantify patterns of allele-specific expression (ASE) in different individuals and cell-types. Previous studies have identified patterns of ASE across human populations for single cell-types; however the degree of tissue-specificity of ASE has not been deeply characterized. In this study, we compare patterns of ASE across multiple tissues from a single individual using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and a targeted, high-resolution assay (mmPCR-Seq). We detect patterns of ASE for rare deleterious and loss-of-function protein-coding variants, informing the frequency at which allelic expression could modify the functional impact of personal deleterious protein-coding across tissues. We demonstrate that these interactions occur for one third of such variants however large direction flips in allelic expression are infrequent.","In this study, we report the impact of loss-of-function and rare deleterious alleles on the expression level of pathogenic protein-coding variants in tissues obtained from a single individual.

Two-component related proteins, such as the Ypd1 phosphorelay protein, have been heralded as antifungal targets as they are not found in humans and because inactivation of YPD1 in several different fungi causes sustained SAPK activation and cell death. However, we have discovered that inactivation of YPD1 in the major human pathogen, Candida albicans, actually enhances virulence. Furthermore, we reveal that this fungus adapts to the sustained activation of the Hog1 SAPK triggered by Ypd1 loss by mounting distinct mechanisms that actively reduce the level of phosphorylated Hog1. These findings question the validity of Ypd1 proteins as broad-spectrum antifungal targets and provide insights into the cellular adaptation to sustained SAPK activation.","C. albicans is a major fungal pathogen that infects humans and animals. Inhibition of Ypd1 by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans results in lethal sustained activation of the ‘p38-related’ Hog1 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). In contrast to many other fungal-component signalling proteins found in animals, YPD1 is considered a prime antifungal target. In this study, we show that the ability of C. albinicans to survive concomitant sustained activation by Hog1 occurs in cells lacking YPD 1. In addition, we find that the inhibition of Hog1 by Ypd 1 is mediated by the Ssk1 response regulator. Importantly, we also show that C. Albicans survives sustained SAPK activation in the short-term, following which it is able to induce the induction of protein tyrosine phosphatase-encoded genes that prevent accumulation of lethal levels of phosphorylated Hog1. These findings reveal a novel cellular adaptation mechanism that may be important for the development of effective anti-carcinogenic drugs."

MYXV virus lacking a functional M013L gene (vMyxM013-KO) induced the early activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in human monocytic cells, causing the secretion of antiviral pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that MYXV protein M013 is a multifunctional immunosubversive protein that co-regulates both the inflammasome complex and the NF-κB signaling pathway simultaneously.","Myxoma virus (MYXV) encodes a member of the cellular pyrin domain (PYD) superfamily, called M013. The viral M013 protein has previously been shown to bind to the host ASC-1 protein and inhibit the cellular inflammasome complex, which regulates the activation of caspase 1-regulated cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Here, we report that human THP-1 monocytic cells infected with MYXV construct a deleted M013L gene (vMyxM013-KO) and rapidly induce high levels of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF, IL-6, MCP-1, and regulated NF-κB. induction of NF-γκB regulated cytokines following infection with vMyxm013- KO was confirmed in vivo by THP1 derived from xenografts and NOD-SCID mice. We also show that vMYxM012-KO virus infection specifically induced rapid phosphorylation of IKK and degradation of IκBα, followed by nuclear translocation of NF -κB/p65. In the absence of virus infection, transiently expressed M013 proteins inhibited the cellular NF-κB-mediated reporter gene expression and nuclear translocations of NF. These results suggest that the M013 inhibitor exerts a dual immuno-subversive role in simultaneous co-regulation of cellular and inflammaome complex NF- κB and anti-inflammatory responses."

We proposed that scabies mites play a role in the establishment, proliferation and transmission of opportunistic pathogens. We investigated here the synergy between mites and one of the most recognised mite associated pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes. As part of the innate immune response mammals have a pre-programmed ability to recognise and immediately act against substances derived from fungal and bacterial microorganisms. This is mediated through a sequential biochemical cascade involving over 30 different proteins (complement system) which as a result of signal amplification triggers a rapid killing response. The complement cascade produces peptides that attract immune cells, increases vascular permeability, coats (opsonises) the surfaces of a pathogen, marking it for destruction, and directly disrupts foreign plasma membranes. To prevent complement mediated damage of their gut cells, scabies mites secrete several classes of complement inhibiting proteins into the mite gut and excrete them into the epidermal mite burrows. Furthermore, these inhibitors also provide protection for S. pyogenes. We verified here specifically the impact of the mite complement inhibitor SMSB4, to identify the molecular mechanisms behind the long recognised tendency of S. pyogenes to infect mite-induced skin lesions.","Scabies is the most common skin disease in the tropics, causing a considerable economic burden for individuals, communities and health systems. There is substantial epidemiological evidence in tropical regions of scabies causing pyoderma and subsequently illness and invasion by opportunistic bacteria. The health burden of scab causing cellulitis, bacteraemia, sepsis, heart and kidney diseases in resource-poor communities is extreme. Co-infections with group streptococcus (GAS) scabies mites are a common phenomenon in tropics. We investigated the relative role of classical (CP), lectin (LP) alternative pathways (AP) and pyodermic GAS in maintaining baseline immunity against GAS. Opsonophagocytosis assays of fresh blood showed baseline immunity to GAS, and the role of innate immunity was investigated by deposition of the complement components of the pathway, specifically C1q, FB and MBL, in normal human serum of GAS isolates. The results indicate that the complement-inhibitory function of SMSB4 promotes the survival of gAS in vitro inferably from the microenvironment of mite-infested skin. Understanding the tripartite interactions between host, parasite and microbial pathogens at the molecular level will serve as the basis to develop improved intervention strategies targeting scabies associated bacterial infections."

Biofilms have a genetically identical sub-population of dormant cells, named persister cells, which are the well-recognized source of antibiotic resistance. Recently, it was demonstrated that toxins are highly upregulated in persisters and have therefore been postulated to play a role in the persister state. Using an inter-disciplinary approach, we reveal how mqsR, the gene most highly upregulated in persisters, together with mqsA, function: they are the founding members of a new family of toxin:antitoxin (TA) systems. Unexpectedly, the structure of MqsR reveals that it is a ribonuclease, a protein that controls the production of other essential proteins. Moreover, we identified multiple features of this TA system that are so unique that each is a starting point for drug development. Unlike other antitoxins, MqsA is structured throughout its entire sequence, its structure is unchanged between the free and toxin-bound states and it binds zinc. It also binds DNA via its C- and not N-terminal domain. Finally, MqsA binds both its own promoter and additional genes important for E. coli physiology. Taken together, our data provide fundamental new insights into the role of MqsR and MqsA in bacterial persistence and biofilms.","The ability of bacteria to survive environmental stress is essential for the survival of bacterial persisters, a sub-population of genetically identical quiescent cells that exhibit multidrug tolerance to highly enriched bacterial toxins.

Here, we report multiple individual complex-dimensional structures of MqsR and antitoxin MqsA (B3021). We reveal that MqsRs: MqsAs form a novel toxin: antitoxin (TA) pair. MqsS adopts an α/β fold homologous RelE/YoeB family of bacterial ribonuclease toxins. MqA is elongated dimer and neutralizes MqsRS toxicity. Unlike the expected TA pair, MqsB binds to promoter genes important for E. coli physiology (e.g. mcbR, spy) and is structured into an entire sequence, which binds to zinc coordinates in the DNA C-N-terminal domain. These studies reveal that TA systems, especially antitoxins, are significantly diverse and may provide new insights into the role of toxins in maintaining the persister state."

Vaccination against VL has received limited attention compared with cutaneous leishmaniasis, although the need for an effective vaccine is pressing for the control of the disease. Earlier, we observed protective efficacy using leishmanial antigen (Ag) in the presence of either cationic liposomes or monophosphoryl lipid A-trehalose dicorynomycolate (MPL-TDM) against experimental VL through the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route of administration in the mouse model. However, this route of immunization is not adequate for human use. For this work, we developed vaccine formulations combining cationic liposomes with MPL-TDM using recombinant GP63 (rGP63) as protein Ag through the clinically relevant subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Two s.c. injections with rGP63 in association with cationic liposomes and MPL-TDM showed enhanced immune responses that further resulted in high protective levels against VL in the mouse model. This validates the combined use of MPL-TDM as an immunopotentiator and liposomes as a suitable vaccine delivery system.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania donovani, a protozoan pathogen that causes severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. Vaccines that activate strong specific Th1-specific immune responses are critically needed to protect against intracellular pathogens, including leishmania.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the immunomodulator liposomal Ag in subcutaneous (s.c) route of immunization, and the usefulness of its prime/boost in VL. In BALB/c mice, we formulated recombinant GP63 (rGP63)-based vaccines with monophosphoryl lipid-trehalose dicorynomycolate (MPL-TDM) and entrapped cationic liposomes. We found that the combined formulation was required for optimum immune response boost, and we chose to evaluate vaccine efficacy in mice primed with the combined adjuvvant system followed by boosting rGP63, association with MPL-TM, and liposome. Our results provide evidences that the presence of liposomically active rgp63 combined formulations is necessary for effective Th1 immune responses (IFN-γ, IL-12, and parasite load in vivo."

The chromosomes are moved by attachment to the long microtubule polymers of the mitotic spindle, formed from a centrosome at each end of the spindle. Mechanisms that restrict DNA replication and centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle are critical, as defects in either event result in genetic instability and are associated with cancer. Cell cycle-dependent control of DNA replication has been extensively studied, but comparatively little is known about the regulation of centrosome duplication, particularly its restriction to once per cell cycle. Using genetics and cytology, including super-resolution imaging to detect reduplicated centrosomes, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation of Sfi1, a conserved component of centrosomes, prevents the occurrence of extra rounds of yeast centrosome duplication during the cell cycle. Additionally, we propose that dephosphorylation of Sfi1 by the phosphatase Cdc14 permits centrosome duplication for the next cell cycle. Our work is the first to provide a mechanism for how centrosome duplication, like DNA replication, occurs once during the cell cycle through cyclin-dependent kinase regulation.","Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are conserved components of centrosomes, which are essential for chromosome segregation, chromosome segregation and growth. In this study, we identified Sfi1, a conserved component of centroomes, as a Cdk substrate that is required to restrict centrosome duplication during the cell cycle. We found that reducing Cdk1 phosphorylation by changing the phosphorylated sites of nonphosphorylated residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs, yeast centrosomal structures) and inappropriate SPB reduplication mitosis. These findings lead to a model for phosphoregulation of Sfi and Cdk, which has a dual function in promoting SPB separation and spindle formation and preventing premature SPB duplication. In addition, we provide evidence that the protein phosphatase Cdc14 has a converse role in activating licensing, likely by dephosphorating Sfi."

Here, we describe the generation of a novel model of transgenic mice (Tg) expressing the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 from cutaneous beta HPV38 in the basal layer of the epidermis. We established two independent lines of HPV38 E6/E7 Tg mice and showed that they both have an increased susceptibility to develop squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in comparison to the wild-type animals when exposed to chemical carcinogens and UV irradiation. Most interestingly, we found that UV irradiation of the Tg animals, promoted the formation of skin lesions that closely resembled the SCC-precursor lesions in humans, actinic keratosis and subsequently SCC. In contrast, we observed that wild-type mice developed neither actinic keratosis nor SCC when exposed to the same dose of UV. In conclusion, we present evidence that supports the role of cutaneous beta HPV types in skin carcinogenesis.","Cutaneous beta human papillomavirus (HPV) types appear to play a direct role in the development of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC).

HPV38 and E6 E7 expressed in the undifferentiated basal layer epithelia of the Keratin 14 (K14) promoter. Viral oncogene expression led to increased cellular proliferation in the epidermis of the Tg animals compared to wild-type littermates.

Furthermore, chronic UV irradiation of the skin of mice induced development of actinic keratosis-like lesions, considered in humans as precursors of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and subsequently SCC in a significant proportion of animals."

One key aspect of studying tumorigenesis is to distinguish the “driver” mutations providing a fitness advantage to cancer cells against neutral “passenger” or “hitchhiking” mutations. Many statistical models to address this question have been developed. Evolutionary models, however, add another layer of complexity by taking into account the process of mutation accumulation and selection within the tissue. Here we present a novel approach combining both statistical and evolutionary thinking to identify driver mutations in cancer genomes using cross-sectional mutation data. Our method considers the process of mutation accumulation and selection before and during colorectal cancer initiation. This work demonstrates the importance of using evolutionary population dynamic models to study driver events of tumorigenesis.","Cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, and it has been successfully treated with drugs targeting mutant onco-proteins. However, a subset of mutations found in the genomic landscape of cancer likely provide a fitness advantage for the cell. Distinguishing “driver” mutations from innocuous “passenger” events is critical for prioritizing validation of candidate mutations in disease-relevant models. We have developed a novel statistical index, called Hitchhiking Index, that reflects the probability of observed candidate gene passenger alteration, given frequency alterations in a cross-sectional cancer sample set. We apply this index to a data set of colorectal cancer. Our methodology is based on population dynamics and model mutation accumulation selection in coloctal tissue prior to cancer initiation and tumorigenesis.

As germ cells mature into sperm and oocytes, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are deliberately created on each chromosome and a subset of DSBs is repaired to form meiotic crossovers between homologous chromosomes. Because germ cells must undergo this programmed process of deliberate DNA damage and repair, identifying repair factors active in germ cells and determining the requirement of their functions in meiotic DSB repair are important first steps in understanding infertility and developmental disorders caused by defective sperm and oocytes. In this manuscript, we find that the evolutionarily conserved SMC-5 and SMC-6 proteins fulfill a critical role in preserving genomic stability in germ cells in C. elegans. Our findings further describe the genetic mechanisms by which the C. elegans SMC-5/6 proteins function in meiotic DSB repair. These data reveal that inter-sister homologous recombination, a repair mechanism thought to function as a back-up repair method in meiosis, serves a more significant role in normal meiosis than was previously appreciated.","During meiosis, programmed DNA breaks (DSBs) are repaired by homologous recombination (HR), which is processed by inter-homolog crossovers to promote accurate segregation of chromosomes. In general, programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed by a number of inter-chromatid crossover, and excess DSBs are repaired to maintain genomic stability. However, it has been postulated that the completion of meiotic DSB repair is crucial for germ cell genome stability. Here, we show that conserved Structural Maintenance Chromosomes (SMC) 5 and 6 proteins are required for successful completion of homolog-independent recombination repair, but appear dispensable for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. Mutations in SMC-5 and smc-6 genes induced chromosome fragments and dismorphology. Chromosome fragments were associated with HR defects in mutants, and disrupted the formation of chiasmata, cytologically visible linkages between homologs and chromosomes that formed during meiotic inter-hologs. These defects were preferentially enhanced by disruptions in inter-hybrid recombination disruptions and disruptions in sister-chromatin recombination. Based on these findings, we propose that C. elegans SMC and SMC are required to ensure the completion and repair of homogen-independent, presumably sister-chromatid-mediated, recombination and repair."

Since obesity rates in children have been increasing in recent years, they may explain part of the rise in T1D rates. However, conventional observational epidemiologic studies are limited in explaining causality because of possible bias from unmeasured confounding and reverse causation.We investigated if genetic variants associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) were also associated with T1D risk in 5,913 T1D and 8,828 control samples.We studied the effect of childhood adiposity on T1D using a Mendelian randomization analysis framework, which uses genetic variants associated with an exposure as instruments to test for effects on an outcome. Since alleles are randomly allocated before birth, Mendelian randomization studies limit bias from confounding factors and reverse causation. We used sensitivity analyses to control for violations of Mendelian randomization assumptions.We estimated that a genetically predicted increase in childhood BMI by 1 standard deviation is associated with an average 32% increased risk of T1D (odds ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.06–1.64).This study provides genetic support for a link between childhood adiposity and T1D risk, which could help explain part of the increase in T1D rates.However, as the underlying genes and adiposity-increasing mechanisms for most of the genetic variants included in the study are not known, there is a possibility that the genetic variants affect T1D risk through other mechanisms than through adiposity, which would limit causal inference.Together with previous studies, our findings reinforce the need to address rising childhood overweight and obesity rates, whose adverse consequences in adulthood pose serious challenges to personal and population health.","The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing globally. The hypothesis that increasing childhood obesity rates explain this increase is challenging to perform. In this study, we assess the hypothesis that a Mendelian randomization approach uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to test causal associations. We created a genetic instrument to identify 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with childhood adiposity in children aged 2–10 years. We extracted the results of a genome-wide association study of 5,913 T1D cases from 8,828 reference samples. We found evidence support for the effect of childhood obesity on childhood obesity risk. Our findings emphasize the importance of measures to reduce the global epidemic of obesity and encourage mechanistic studies."

Here, we analyze thirteen epigenetic mark maps in the human cell line K562 at 100 kb resolution of MRT data. The complexity of epigenetic data is reduced to four chromatin states that display remarkable similarities with those reported in fly, worm and plants. These states have different MRT: (C1) is transcriptionally active, early replicating, enriched in CTCF; (C2) is Polycomb repressed, mid-S replicating; (C3) lacks of marks and replicates late and (C4) is a late-replicating gene-poor HP1 repressed heterochromatin state. When mapping these states inside the 876 replication U-domains of K562, the replication fork polarity gradient observed in these U-domains comes along with a remarkable epigenetic organization from C1 at U-domain borders to C2, C3 and ultimately C4 at centers. The remaining genome half displays early replicating, gene rich and high GC domains of intermingled C1 and C2 states segregating from late replicating, gene poor and low GC domains of concatenated C3 and/or C4 states. This constitutes the first evidence of epigenetic compartmentalization of the human genome into replication domains likely corresponding to autonomous units in the 3D chromatin architecture.","Epigenetic modifications play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of the spatio-temporal replication program in higher eukaryotes. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the initiation of this program remain elusive. Here, we use genome-wide distributions of thirteen epigenetic marks in the human cell line K562, 100 kb resolution corresponding to mean replication timing (MRT) data, to identify the major groups of chromatin marks shared features. We show that early in the replication process, early in late replicating, replication proceeds through transcriptionally active euchromatin state (C1), repressive type chromatin (C2) associated polycomb complexes, silent state (CC3) enriched with available marks, and gene poor HP1-associated heterochromatin states (C4). By mapping chromatin states inside megabase-sized U-domain (U-shaped MRT profile) covering 50% of the human genome, we reveal that the associated replication fork polarity gradient corresponds to a directional path along chromatin regions, with C1 U-domains borders followed by C2, C3, and C4 centers. Our analysis reveals that the genome is consistent with early late replication loci occurring in separate compartments, correspond to gene-rich, high-GC domains intermingled with chromatin state C1 and C2 and C3 and long C4 domains. This new segmentation sheds new light on the epigenetic regulation of the replication program and provides a framework for studies of different cell types, health and disease."

Meiosis is the specialized cellular program in which a diploid cell gives rise to haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. Crossing-over between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (homologs) is a central feature of this program, playing a role not only for increasing genetic diversity but also for ensuring regular segregation of homologs at the first meiotic division. The distribution of crossovers (COs) along meiotic chromosomes is a paradigmatic example of spatial patterning. Crossovers occur at different positions in different meiotic nuclei but, nonetheless, tend to be evenly spaced along the chromosomes. We previously-described a mechanical “stress and stress relief” model for CO patterning with an accompanying mathematical description (the “beam-film model”). In this paper we explore the roles of mathematical parameters in this model; show that it can very accurately describe experimental data sets from several organisms, in considerably quantitative depth; and discuss implications of the model for several phenomena that are directly related to crossover patterning, including the features which can ensure that every chromosome always acquires at least one crossover.","Meiotic crossover (CO) sites are spatially patterned on chromosomes. CO-designation position disfavors subsequent CO- designation(s) nearby, and COs tend to be evenly spaced. We have previously proposed a mechanical model of CO patterning. We explore the nature of the mechanical mechanism of communication between chromosomes, required for CO interference, and the redistribution of mechanical stress. We show that CO patterns can be quantitatively explained in detail in organisms, with implications for important patterning-related phenomena: CO homeostasis, fact that the level of zero-CO bivalents is low (“ obligatory CO”), and the occurrence of non-interacting COs.

Of these, approximately one-third will develop chronic disease pathology, leading to disability and premature death. Only two drugs are available, both of which can have severe side effects. We know relatively little about the chronic phase of this infection because the parasite burden is extremely low, and animal models have limitations. Here, we describe a T. cruzi reporter strain that has been genetically modified to express a fusion protein which is both bioluminescent and fluorescent. These parasites can be monitored throughout the infection, and individual parasites identified in tissue sections from infected mice. This allows us for the first time to analyse host-parasite interactions at a cellular level in the chronic phase of infection. We have also incorporated a streamlined version of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system into the reporter strain. We demonstrated the utility of this system by generating null mutants in the flagellar attachment protein GP72, by replacing the green fluorescent protein with a red fluorescent protein, and by tagging the endogenous protein DNA topoisomerase 1A. This T. cruzi reporter line will significantly enhance our ability to unravel the pathogenesis and immunology of chronic Chagas disease.","Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, a major public health problem in Latin America. Efforts to generate new therapies have been hampered by limitations in understanding parasite biology and disease pathogenesis. Studies have compromised the complexity of the disease, the long-term nature of infection, and the fact parasites are barely detectable at the chronic stage. In addition, functional dissection of T. cruzi biology is restricted by the limited flexibility of genetic manipulation technology applicable to the parasite. Here, we describe technical innovations, which allow the role of parasite disease progression and disease progression better assessed. First, we generated a reporter strain that expresses a fusion protein comprising red- shifted luciferase and green fluorescent protein domains. This allows the kinetics of infection followed by a single animal, and specific foci of infection are pinpointed in excised tissues. Fluorescence allows us to visualise individual parasites in tissue sections and to study host-parasite interactions at the cellular level. This strategy is routinely able to find individual parasites chronically infected in murine tissues at the time of infection. The second advance is the incorporation of a streamlined CRISPR/Cas9 functionality into the reporter strain to facilitate genome editing. The system allows rapid generation of null mutants of fluorescently tagged parasites and their background in vivo phenotype can be rapidly assessed. These techniques have been described in multiple applications, including studying aspects of parasite biology, pathogenesis and parasite interactions."

Due to size constraints, newly formed nucleocapsids are unable to leave the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. Instead herpesviruses apply an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for nuclear export of capsids called nuclear egress. This process is initiated by docking of capsids at the inner nuclear membrane, budding of enveloped capsids into the perinuclear space followed by de-envelopment and release of capsids to the cytoplasm where further maturation occurs. Two viral proteins conserved throughout the herpesvirus family, the membrane protein pUL34 and the phosphoprotein pUL31 form the nuclear egress complex that is critical for primary envelopment. We show here that pUL31 and pUL34 enter the nucleus independently of each other. pUL31 is targeted to the nucleoplasm where it binds to nucleocapsids via the conserved C-terminal domain, while its N-terminal domain is important for capsid translocation to the nuclear envelope and for a coordinated interaction with pUL34. Our data suggest a mechanism that is apparently conserved among all herpesviruses with pUL31 escorting nucleocapsids to the nuclear envelope in order to couple capsid maturation with primary envelopment.","Progeny capsids are viral proteins that enter the nucleus via the budding nuclear envelope. The viral proteins pUL34 and nucleo-phosphoprotein pUL31 form a nuclear egress complex that is required for capsid egress from the nucleus. PUL31 orthologs are composed of a diverse N-terminal domain and 3 basic patches conserved in the C-terminus. To decipher the functions of the N- terminal domain, we generated Herpes simplex virus mutants lacking the N -terminal domains and found that pUL30 and pUL4 are essential for nuclear import into the nucleus and are required for nuclear export into the cytoplasm. Replacing the authentic basic patches with a novel artificial resulted in HSV1(17+)Lox-UL31-hbpmp1mp2, viable delayed viral egress and compromised viral production. Our data indicate that the nuclear localization signal embedded in the embedded domain is essential for the nuclear import from the nuclear envelope and that nuclear import is coordinated with the interaction of pUL33."

Drosophila sechellia, a fruit fly endemic to the Seychelles, feeds exclusively on the ripe fruit of Morinda citrifolia, a tropical plant commonly known as Tahitian Noni. Although other fruit flies never approach this fruit because of its toxins, D. sechellia is resistant and is actually attracted by the same toxins. D. sechellia is a close relative of D. melanogaster, an established model species of genetics. By comparing D. melanogaster and D. sechellia, we revealed that two genes encoding odorant-binding proteins, Obp57d and Obp57e, are not only involved in the fruit fly's taste perception, but can also change the behavioral response of the flies to the toxins contained in the fruit. By knowing how an insect's food preference is determined by its genes, we can gain insight into how insect lifestyles evolve and investigate whether such changes can lead to the formation of new species. We can also begin to understand how to manipulate insects' behavior by changing their preference for particular substances.","Drosophila melanogaster and Morinda citrifolia have evolved distinct physiological and behavioral adaptations. The odor of the ripe fruit of M. citriferifolia originates from hexanoic octanoic acid. D. sechellia attracted fatty acids, but the species complex repelled them. Here, we show that the Odorant-binding protein 57e (Obp57e) gene is involved in the behavioral difference between the two species. We also show that D. melogaster knock-flies and D. simulans have altered their behavioral responses to hexoic acid and octoic acids. Furthermore, the introduction of Obp57d into D. spp. flies and the olfactory site preference of D. melanogast flies shifted from the oviposition site to the preference of the Olfactory receptor in D. albicans. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying taste perception, evolution of plant–herivore interactions, speciation, and speciation."

Chlamydia must live inside human cells to survive, and here we study the mechanism of how it enters cells, which is critical to the lifecycle. We study how the bacterium exploits signalling pathways inside the cell to its own advantage to deform the cell membrane by reorganising the underlying cell skeleton, and identify new factors involved in this process. Our findings suggest intriguing similarities with how some viruses enter cells. A better understanding of these processes may help to develop future vaccines and new treatments.","Pathogens hijack host endocytic pathways to force entry into eukaryotic target cells. Most pathogenic bacteria exploit receptor-mediated zippering to inject virulence proteins that directly trigger membrane reorganisation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. In contrast, extracellular C. trachomatis elementary bodies (EBs) apparently employ facets of zipper trigger mechanisms ~400 nm in diameter. Using cryo-electron tomography, we identified an unexpectedly diverse array of host structures in association with invading EBs, suggesting that internalisation progress through multiple, potentially redundant routes of sequential events in a single pathway. We also performed quantitative analysis of actin organisation and chlamydial entry foci, highlighting filopodial capture and phagocytic cups as the dominant conserved morphological structures early in internalisation. We then applied inhibitor-based screening to systematically assess the spatio-temporal contribution of diverse endocytotic signalling mediators to C. Trachomaatis entry.

PARP inhibitors are emerging as promising anticancer therapeutics and are currently undergoing clinical trials. It is therefore important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor actions of these drugs. In our current study, we elucidated novel anti-neoplastic properties of PARP inhibitors that are responsible for the anti-metastatic effect of these drugs in the context of malignant melanoma. These effects appear to be the result of PARP-1's ability to regulate the expression of key factors, such as vimentin and VE-cadherin, involved in vascular cell dynamics and to limit pro-malignant processes such as vasculogenic mimicry and EMT.","In metastatic melanoma, PARP inhibitors induce anti-neoplastic effects in monotherapy and combination chemo- radiotherapy in tumor settings; however, the basis of the anti- metastasic activities resulting from PARP inhibition remains unknown. PARP-1 inhibitors act as modulators of tumor angiogenesis. Proteomic analysis of endothelial cells revealed that vimentin, an intermediary filament involved in angioplasty and a specific hallmark of EndoMT (endhelial mesenchymal transition) transformation, is-regulated following loss of PARP. VE-cadherin, endothelial marker of vascular normalization, and HUVEC treated with PARP inhibitor were also-regulated. Vimentin-expression was sufficient to drive the endoMT phenotype, including vasculogenic mimicry. Our results suggest that PARP is an inhibitor of key metastasis-promoting processes, leading to suppression of invasion and colonization of the distal organs of aggressive metastatic cells."

But 1 in 3 women have a stillborn baby prior to this gestational age.Mothers need robust estimates of potential risks of stillbirth and newborn death at term to make decisions on timing of delivery.We collated data from all relevant studies found in a systematic review and determined the additional risks of stillbirth and newborn death in mothers at term gestation, by comparing pregnancies that continued versus delivered at various gestational ages,.We found a steady increase in the risk of stillbirth with advancing gestation at term. In mothers who continued their pregnancy to 41 weeks, there was a 64% increase in the risk of stillbirth compared to those who delivered at 40 weeks, with 1 additional mother having a stillborn baby for every 1,449 women.The risks of newborn death remained constant between 38 and 41 weeks, and only increased beyond 41 weeks.Any mother considering prolongation of pregnancy beyond 37 weeks should be informed of the additional small but significantly increased risk of stillbirth with advancing gestation.Women planning delivery before 41 weeks gestation can be reassured that there is no additional risk of newborn death when delivering between 38 and 41 weeks.Our findings are limited by variations in the definition of low-risk pregnancy, the inclusion of studies over a long period of time, and the possibility of other unaccounted factors that may have affected the outcomes.","Despite advances in healthcare, stillbirth rates remain relatively unchanged.

These fibers are organized in elaborate structures that form sarcomeres in the muscle and the contractile ring during cytokinesis. In cytokinesis, the establishment of an equatorial actomyosin ring is preceded and regulated by many cell cycle events, and the ring itself is a complex and dynamic structure. Here we report the presence of an equatorial circumferential actomyosin structure with remarkable similarities to the cytokinetic ring formed in postmitotic notochord cells of sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. The notochord is a transient rod-like structure found in all embryos that belong to the phylum Chordata, and in Ciona, a simple chordate, it consists of only 40 cylindrical cells arranged in a single file, which elongate individually during development. Our study shows that the activity of the equatorial actomyosin ring is required for the elongation of the notochord cells. We also find that cortical flow contributes significantly to the formation of the ring at the equator. Similar to cytokinetic cells, we observe the formation of membrane blebs outside the equatorial region. Our analyses suggest that cooperation of actomyosin ring-based circumferential constriction and bleb-associated contractions drive cell elongation in Ciona. We conclude that cells can utilize a cytokinesis-like force generation mechanism to promote cell shape change instead of cell division.","Cell shape changes and proliferation are fundamental strategies for morphogenesis in animal development. During embryogenesis of the simple chordate Ciona intestinalis, elongation of individual notochord cells constitutes a crucial stage in the development of the larval body plan. However, the mechanism of cell elongation remains elusive. Here, we show that when notchord cells divide, we use a cytokinesis-like actomyosin mechanism to drive cell elongations. We show that the actomyoinsin network forming the equator of the notochard cell includes phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain, α-actinin, cofilin, tropomyosins, and talin. We also show that cofilins and α-actinginin are crucial components of the cell structure and elongation. Cortical flow contributes to the assembly of the ring and the formation of a membrane bleb. Similar to cytokinetic cells, membrane blebs cause local contractions that form in the basal cortex. These bleb-associated contractions form in basal cortex, which promote cell shape change. Our results demonstrate that the cytokinesi-like contractile mechanism can be co-opted in a completely different developmental scenario to achieve cell shape changes instead of cell division."

Genome-scale metabolic models, with the assumption of steady state for the internal metabolites, allow the definition of a region of feasible metabolic flux distributions. This space of solutions can be further constrained using experimental flux measurements (normally production or uptake rates of external compounds). Here a random sampling method was used to obtain average values and standard deviations for all the reaction rates in a genome-scale model. These values were used to quantify the significance of changes in metabolic fluxes between different conditions. The significance in flux changes can be compared to the changes in gene transcription of the corresponding enzymes. Our method allowed for identification of specific reactions that are transcriptionally regulated, and we further identified that these reactions can be ascribed to a few key transcription factors. This suggests that the regulation of metabolism has evolved to contain a few flux-regulating transcription factors that could be the target for genetic manipulations in order to redirect fluxes.","Genome-scale metabolic models are available for an increasing number of organisms. However, these models are limited to a small set of experimental metabolic fluxes, which reduces the region of feasible metabolic states. In this work, we use a set of possible flux distributions obtained from random sampling averages of standard deviations of metabolic flux from the genome-scale model to estimate the significance of change in reaction rate under different conditions. The comparison of flux change with gene expression allows identification of enzymes showing a significant correlation between flux change and expression change. We show that changes in growth of different carbon sources are likely driven by changes in metabolite concentrations. We also show that the changes in transcriptional regulation showed enrichment of certain transcription factors. The information provided here will guide the discovery of new metabolic engineering strategies for the identification of drug targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases."

Clearly this is a result of interaction between modern cultural and environmental factors with the genetic legacy of human history. To estimate the extent of the effects of environmental factors, including lifestyle and geography, on gene expression, we examined gene expression differentiation in peripheral blood leukocyte samples from three Moroccan Amazigh groups leading distinct ways of life: desert nomadic, mountain agrarian and coastal urban. Our data shows that as much as one third of the leukocyte transcriptome is associated with differences among the three regions. Network analysis implies that specific aspects of immune function are strongly affected by regional factors and may influence disease susceptibility. Genetic and methylation differentiation between the three regions is limited and is unlikely to explain the extent of the observed gene expression differentiation. Insight gained from this study highlights the impact transitions from traditional to modern lifestyles likely have on human disease susceptibility and further warrant the need to incorporate gene expression profiling alongside genetic association studies for the prediction of disease susceptibility.","Different environments are likely to impact physiology and disease susceptibility.

The high mutation rate of RNA viruses increases the ability of these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts and cause new human and zoonotic diseases. The genetic diversity of a viral population within a host may allow the virus to adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures and enable cross-species transmission events. In 2009 a large outbreak of rabies in Northern California involved a skunk rabies virus variant that efficiently transmitted within a population of gray foxes, suggesting possible adaptation to a novel host species. To better understand the evolution of rabies virus that enabled this host jump, we applied deep-sequencing analysis to rabies virus samples from the outbreak. Deep-sequencing data indicated that many of the genetic changes associated with host jump occurred prior to 2009, and these mutations were present at very low frequencies in viral populations from samples dating back to 1995. These results suggest deep sequencing is useful for characterization of viral populations, and may provide insight to ancestral genomes and role of rare variants in viral emergence.","Rabies is a mosquito-borne disease that is transmitted to humans by the bite of a rabid fox. The disease is transmitted by a single bite of an infected fox, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality. In this study, we used deep sequencing to analyze a densely sampled outbreak of rabies virus in Humboldt County, California. We found that a single amino acid change in the G protein of a haplotype present in a subset of the northern foxes haplotype was associated with increased transmission of the virus in the region. Deep-sequencing data indicated that genetic changes associated with the CST event occurred prior to 2009 and that nonsynonymous mutations were present in consensus sequences of skunk fox rabies samples obtained between 20032010 and 2009. These results suggest that analysis of rare variants in the viral population may yield clues to ancestral genomes and identify rare variants that are potential to be selected for when environment conditions change."

However, how CO regulates FT expression in the context of chromatin remains largely obscure. In this work, we present Arabidopsis MRG1/2 as novel chromatin effectors directly involved in the CO-FT photoperiodic flowering. Firstly, MRG1/2 proteins are identified as recognition factors of H3K4 and H3K36 methylation via their chromodomains. The mrg1 mrg2 double mutant shows a late-flowering phenotype only under long-day conditions through down-regulation of FT but not of CO. MRG2 can directly target in vivo the FT promoter chromatin in a H3K4me3/H3K36me3-level dependent manner. More importantly, MRG2 and CO physically interact and enhance each other's binding to the FT promoter in planta. Determination of co-crystal structures of MRG2 with H3K4me3/H3K36me3 peptides and mutagenesis of a key amino acid residue involved in structural interaction demonstrate that MRG2 reader activity is essential for in planta function. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel mechanism of FT activation in flowering promotion and provide a striking example of mutual interplay between a transcription factor and a histone methylation reader in transcription regulation.","During flowering, the florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is a key flowering pathway in long-day photoperiods.

In this study, we show that the Arabidopsis Morf Related Gene (MRG) group of proteins and the MRG3 and H3K4me3/H3K36me3 readers physically interact with CO to promote FT expression during flowering. In vitro and in vitro binding analyses indicated that the chromodomains that bind to MRG 1 andMRG2 preferentially bind to H3G4me2 and H2K4ME3 peptides. The mrg1 and mrg2 double mutant exhibits reduced mRNA levels in FT, CO, and plants.

Under the assumptions of the neutral model of molecular evolution, the amount of variation present in a population should be directly proportional to the size of the population. However, this prediction does not tally with real-life observations: levels of genetic diversity are found to be substantially more uniform, even among species with widely differing population sizes, than expected. Because natural selection—which removes genetically linked neutral variation—is more efficient in larger populations, selection on novel mutations offers a potential reconciliation of this paradox. In this work, we align and jointly analyze whole genome genetic variation data from a wide variety of species. Using this dataset and population genetic models of the impact of selection on neutral variation, we test the prediction that selection will disproportionally remove neutral variation in species with large population sizes. We show that genomic signature of natural selection is pervasive across most species, and that the amount of linked neutral variation removed by selection correlates with proxies for population size. We propose that pervasive natural selection constrains neutral diversity and provides an explanation for why neutral diversity does not scale as expected with population size.","The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that neutral polymorphisms in species increase proportionally with census population size (Nc). However, this prediction is borne out in practice: the range of Nc spans orders of magnitude, while levels of genetic diversity in species fall in a comparatively narrow range. The theoretical arguments invoked by increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations explain this discrepancy, but no direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of the hypothesis that natural selection reduces the level of neutral diversity in a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. Our results demonstrate that the magnitude of the impact of natural natural selection on neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. We show that in regions with relatively low recombination, selected variants affect neutral sites at linkage, resulting in a correlation between recombination and polymorphism. This correlation allows us to estimate the degree of the degree to which natural selection removes the linked neutral diversity between 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes."

Using different approaches, we have detected the orthologues EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 proteins in Entamoeba histolytica. Trophozoites are particularly rich in membranes and vacuoles, but they do not possess the machinery to synthetize cholesterol. Thus, they are completely dependent on molecules able to “fish” cholesterol from the medium. The relevance of our findings lies in the fact that cholesterol is fundamental for endocytosis and motility; and, phagocytosis is an important nutritional and virulence factor for E. histolytica. In silico and experimental strategies, using U18666A to arrest cholesterol trafficking, as well as, knockdown mutants, showed that EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 participate in cholesterol uptake and trafficking in this parasite. They are secreted by trophozoites and directly involved in erythrophagocytosis and motility. Our findings revealed E. histolytica as one of the first protozoa in which these proteins are being characterized. Moreover, E. histolytica provides an excellent and less complicated model to elucidate the intricate event of cholesterol trafficking in eukaryotic cells. The relevance of cholesterol transport for the parasite virulence and the involvement of EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 in this process, make these proteins promising targets for therapy strategies development against the parasite.","Entamoeba histolytica, a highly phagocytic protozoan causative of human amoebiasis, lacks machinery to synthesize cholesterol. In this study, we investigated the presence of Ehnpc1 and NPC2 proteins in the parasite, which are involved in cholesterol trafficking in mammals.

We also found that both proteins were involved in the trafficking of cholesterol to the cytoplasmic reticulum of the phagolysosomes.

The disease is caused by the reduction of the protein survival motor neuron (SMN), which is involved in the assembly of ubiquitous small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. As SMN is required in every cell, it is important to understand the differential functionality of the protein within developing tissues. In this paper, we identify stem cells as having the highest levels of SMN. The concentration of SMN then decreases in a declining gradient until it reaches its lowest level in differentiated cells. SMN reduction, using clonal analysis, slows stem cell division and can lead to stem cell loss. These defects correlate with a reduction in the U2 and U5 small nuclear RNAs and with the mislocalisation of Miranda protein in postembryonic neuroblasts. In addition, we show that the overexpression of SMN can change the timing of development and cell differentiation. This research highlights possible mechanisms explaining how SMN expression alterations may affect tissue development.","Spinal muscular atrophy is a severe neurogenic disease caused by mutations in the human survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN is required for the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and a dramatic reduction of the protein leads to cell death.

Its infectious agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is transmitted mainly by the feces of insects called triatomines. Although great progress has been made in reducing transmission in the countries in the southern cone of South America, limited progress has been made in the Andean countries, partly because of lack of knowledge and partly because of limited resources and technical capability of control efforts. We report the first entomological survey conducted in southern Ecuador to learn the distribution of triatomines, their habitat and microhabitat preferences, and factors that favor their presence. The results of the study show that 9% of households in 92 rural communities harbor well-established triatomine populations. These rural areas in the southern Andean region are among the poorest in the country; most of the population lives in sub-standard housing, under conditions that favor the presence of Chagas disease vectors. These results, combined with recent reports of widespread triatomine infestation of wild animal nests in sylvatic areas throughout the region and frequent reports of reinfestation after control intervention, indicate the need for effective, monitored, and sustained vector control to reduce the high risk of infection to which approximately 100,000 people living in rural areas of southern Ecuador are exposed.","Chagas disease is endemic in the southern Andean region of Ecuador, the area with the highest poverty rates in the country. In this study, we describe the rate of triatomine household infestation in Loja province, Ecuador.

In addition, we found that three species (Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, Triatoma carrioni, Panstrongylus chinai, and P. rufotuberculatus) were infesting domiciles in 68% of 92 rural communities examined. Triatomine infestation was associated with surrogate poverty indicators, poor sanitary infrastructure, lack of latrine/ toilet [w = 0.95], and sewage environment [w=1.0].

Chikungunya fever begins as a flu-like illness, which progresses to severe arthralgia and debilitating arthritis. This syndrome is often self-limited and rarely fatal; however many patients develop persistent arthralgia that can last from months to years. Currently there is no licensed vaccine or specific treatment for CHIKF, leaving current treatment as purely supportive in nature. The role of the adaptive immune system in disease course and viral persistence is still poorly understood. The lack of an animal model of persistent CHIKF has hindered the study of the role of the adaptive immune response and safety testing of vaccine candidates, which are under development. Due to the fact that the vaccine candidate would be deployed in areas where numerous individuals have an impaired adaptive immune system due to malnutrition or disease (HIV/AIDS); it is important to study the safety of the vaccine candidate in immunodeficient animals with no adaptive immune system. In this study we present an animal model of persistent CHIKV in adult mice, which lack an adaptive immune system and demonstrate the safety of a live-attenuated vaccine candidate.","Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative agent of severe arthralgia in Africa, Asia, Europe, and recently, the Americas.

Despite its importance as a human health and economic standpoint, there is no licensed vaccine specific treatment to prevent CHIKF. In this study, we have begun to elucidate the pathogenesis of CHIKCF and its mechanism of persistent and chronic arthrafilaria, which is poorly understood. In addition, we lack an animal model of chronic infection and limited studies of CHKV pathogenesis and ability to assess the safety of vaccine candidates currently in development. To address this deficiency, recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1-/-) knockout mice, deficient in T B lymphocytes, develop a chronic CHIK virus infection model. This model will be used for evaluating the safety and efficacy of a live-attenuated vaccine candidate."

By contrast, it is unknown how frequently epigenetic variation causes differences in organismal phenotypes. Epigenetic information is closely associated with but not encoded in the DNA sequence. In practice, it is challenging to disentangle genetic variation from epigenetic variation, as what appears to be epigenetic variation might have an underlying genetic basis. DNA methylation is one form of epigenetic information. HDG3 encodes an endosperm specific transcription factor that exists in two states in A. thaliana natural populations: methylated and expressed and hypomethylated and repressed. We show that pure epigenetic variation is sufficient to explain expression variation of HDG3 - a naturally lowly expressed allele can be switched to a higher expressed state by adding DNA methylation. We also show that expression of HDG3 in strains where it is normally hypomethylated and relatively repressed causes a seed development phenotype. These data indicate that naturally circulating epialleles have consequences for seed phenotypic variation.","In plants, epigenetic variation is associated with a strong association with epigenetic modifications. In mammals and flowering plants, a subset of genes are expressed in the parental allele process called gene imprinting. In flowering plants imprinting occurs in the seed tissue-endosperm. Proper endosperm development is essential for the production of viable seeds. We previously showed that Arabidopsis thaliana intraspecific imprinting variation correlated with naturally occurring DNA methylation polymorphisms. We investigated the mechanisms of the function of allele-specific imprinting in class IV homeodomain leucine zipper (HD- ZIP) transcription factor HDG3. We manipulated the methylation state of the endogenous HDG1 non-imprinted strain and demonstrated that methylation of the proximal transposable element was sufficient to promote HDG2 expression.

How this genome instability begins has not been defined, except in cases of familial cancers, which often have mutations in genes called “caretaker” genes, necessary to preserve DNA stability. We have defined a mechanism for genome instability in non-familial tumors that occur sporadically in the population. Certain fragile regions of our DNA are more difficult to duplicate during cell division and are prone to breakage. A fragile region, FRA3B, lies within the FHIT gene, and deletions within FRA3B are common in precancer cells, causing loss of Fhit protein expression. We find that loss of Fhit protein causes defective DNA replication, leading to further DNA breaks. Cells that continue DNA replication in the absence of Fhit develop numerous chromosomal aberrations. Importantly, cells established from tissues of mice that are missing Fhit undergo selection for increasing DNA alterations that can promote immortality, a cancer cell hallmark. Thus, loss of Fhit expression in precancer cells is the first step in the initiation of genomic instability and facilitates cancer development.","Genomic instability drives tumorigenesis, but the origin of genomic instability is unknown. In early preneoplasias, alterations in chromosome fragile sites arise from DNA replication stress. The most frequent, earliest, genetic alteration is the deletion of the fragile FRA3B/FHIT locus, leading to loss of Fhit protein expression. In cancer cells, Fhit loss is a selective advantage that impairs the loss of expression of fragile gene products. In normal, transformed, cancer-derived cell lines Fhit-depletion causes replication stress-induced DNA double-strand breaks. DNA combing, observed that defect in replication fork progression in Fhit deficient cells stemmed primarily from fork stalling and collapse. The likely mechanism of this defect is the regulation of Thymidine kinase 1 expression and thymidine triphosphate pool levels; notably, restoration of nucleotide balance rescued DNA replication defects and suppressed DNA breakage in cells that were not infected with Fhit. We propose that loss-induced genome instability is a step in the initiation of genome instability."

As a common mechanism, animals, plants and fungi use a large arsenal of carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) to protect themselves from predation and parasitism. The success of this type of innate defence mechanism critically depends on the diversity of specific recognition of foreign carbohydrate structures by the host lectins. In this study, we use NMR structure determination to show that part of this diversity is created by the plasticity of common protein folds. The identified fungal lectin that is toxic to nematodes and insects, adopts a common lectin fold but is remarkable in terms of its specificity and affinity for the recognized foreign carbohydrate structure, the number and location of the carbohydrate binding sites on the protein and the degree of oligomerization. Since the identified in vivo target of the fungal lectin is characteristic for invertebrates, our results may be exploited to develop novel approaches for the control of animal and human parasites.","The innate defence mechanism is mediated by lectins recognizing non-self carbohydrate structures. This defence relies on an arsenal of host lectins with different specificities to target organism carbohydrate structures and their targets. Recently, cytoplasmic lectins isolated from fungal fruiting bodies have been shown to play a role in defence against multicellular fungi and predators. Here, we present a novel fruiting body lectin, CCL2, in the ink cap mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea. We show that the toxicity of lectin Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster in C. elegans is mediated through the binding of a complex complex of trisaccharide, GlcNAcβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlcNc, to a single, topologically novel carbohydrate-binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of mutants resistant to lectin nematotoxicity mediated by binding to the α1,2-fucosylated N-glycan core structures of nematode glycoproteins. The feeding of fluorescently labeled mutants of CCL 2 demonstrates that the glycoepitope is a target glycoprotein that localizes to the intestine. Our results provide a novel mechanism by which lectin-mediated toxicity can be targeted by mammalian immune systems."

We show that different types of mutation vary in concert and in a manner that is not expected to generate variation in base composition; hence mutation bias is not responsible for the large-scale variation in base composition that is observed across human chromosomes. As expected, large-scale variation in the rate of divergence between species and the variation within species across the genome, are correlated to the rate of mutation, but the correlation between divergence and the mutation rate is not as strong as it could be. We show that biased gene conversion is responsible for weakening the correlation. In contrast, we find that most of the variation across the genome in diversity can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. Finally, we show that the correlation between the rate of mutation in humans and the divergence between humans and other species, weakens as the species become more divergent.","A long suspected rate of mutation varies across the human genome at large scale based on divergence between humans and other species. However, it is not possible to directly investigate the question of the large number of de novo mutations (DNMs) discovered in humans sequencing trios. We investigate the number of questions pertaining to the distribution of mutations in 130,000 DNMs in large datasets. We show that pattern variation differs between datasets at 1 MB and 100 KB scales probably consequence of differences in sequencing technology and processing time. In particular, datasets with different patterns of correlation between genomic variables and replication time are likely to represent true patterns. We find that variation in mutation rate at 100 KB, 1 MB, and 10 MB scales is explained by variation at smaller scales, and that level variation at modest large scales –1 MB scale infer ~90% of regions of mutation rate 50% mean. Different types of mutation with similar levels of variation appear to vary in concert, which suggests that the pattern of mutation is relatively constant in the genome. We also find that genomic features explain 40% of the explainable variance in the rate of DNM. These findings provide evidence that the effect of biased gene conversion probability on mutation rate is fixed. Finally, we find that the correlation between divergence and DNM density declines as increasingly divergent species are considered."

What is the impact of cooperative, or correlated, spiking among multiple cells? We can start addressing these questions, as rapid advances in experimental techniques allow simultaneous recordings from ever-increasing populations. However, we still lack a general understanding of the origin and consequences of the joint activity that is revealed. The challenge is compounded by the fact that both the intrinsic dynamics of single cells and the correlations among then vary depending on the overall state of the network. Here, we develop a toolbox that addresses this issue. Specifically, we show how linear response theory allows for the expression of correlations explicitly in terms of the underlying network connectivity and known single-cell properties – and that the predictions of this theory accurately match simulations of a touchstone, nonlinear model in computational neuroscience, the general integrate-and-fire cell. Thus, our theory should help unlock the relationship between network architecture, single-cell dynamics, and correlated activity in diverse neural circuits.","Neurons have been shown to be highly correlated with each other. However, it is not clear how such correlations can be explained. Here, we address this problem by extending prior techniques based on linear response theory. We provide explicit expressions for the average correlation structure of randomly connected networks. We show that correlations depend strongly on the operating point (the input mean variance) of neurons, and connectivity is fixed. Our approximations admit expansion powers of matrices that describe network architecture. We apply our results to large excitatory-inhibitory networks, and demonstrate that the precise balance between the strengths and the strengths of the timescales of excitsatory and inhibitory synapses reflected in the overall correlation structure in the network. These expressions help identify important factors that shape coordinated neural activity networks."

The current antiviral therapy of pegylated interferon-2 alfa + ribavirin is successful in only half of treated patients. This has led to an intensive effort to design improved therapeutic strategies. The identification of cellular cofactors of HCV infection greatly expands the pool of potential targets for drug design. In this paper, we combine RNA interference analysis of HCV endocytosis with the development of live cell imaging of highly infectious HCV particles. We identify 16 host cofactors of HCV entry, most of which function in sequential stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We observe the trafficking of fluorescent HCV particles with these cellular cofactors and their related pathways, including the actin cytoskeleton, known receptors CD81 and the tight junction protein claudin-1, clathrin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and early endosomes.

MDA has proven to be a cost-effective and efficient method of disease control, both for LF and other NTDs. Previously, we developed scale-up scenarios of varying magnitude to reach elimination (elimination of LF in all countries that have previously undertaken MDA) and eradication (local elimination of LF in all LF endemic countries) and estimated the number of associated treatments that would be necessary in each country under each scenario. Here we project the costs—both financial and economic—of each of these scenarios. We use data from a myriad of sources to estimate the cost of various activities, and found that training and advocacy and communication activities comprise the bulk of the costs of the program. Among all scenarios, elimination requires the least total investment. However, in terms of LF eradication, faster rates of MDA scale-up are associated with decreased overall costs.","Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) that is preventable by mass drug administration (MDA) and is considered possibly eradicable.

In contrast, previously developed LF eradication scenarios assume LF endemic countries undertake MDA average (indication), fast (endemic) and instantaneous (induction III) rate scale-based. In this analysis, we use a micro-costing model to project the financial and economic costs of these scenarios in order to provide evidence of decision makers' investment required to eliminate LF. Costing was undertaken from a health system perspective, with a discount rate of 3% applied to calculate the net present value of future costs. Prospective NTD budgets for LF in endemic countries were reviewed preliminarily to determine the activities and resources necessary to undertake the program and eliminate LF at the country level. In consultation with LF program experts, activities resources were reviewed and a refined list of the necessary resources, associated quantities and costs, determined grouped into the following activities: advocacy communication, capacity strengthening, coordination and strengthening of partnerships, data management, ongoing surveillance, monitoring supervision, drug delivery, administration, and monitoring. The costs of mapping, mapping, and undertaking transmission assessment surveys, and the value of donated drugs and volunteer time were accounted for. Our results indicate that the eradication of LF is an accelerated scale-projected best investment."

Stressful environmental conditions should favor trading between species that can produce a given resource or service at the lowest cost. Mutualisms, in which both interacting species incur a net benefit, may thus strengthen under stressful conditions. Here we examine an ant–plant mutualism, in which plants provide food and housing for ants and ants defend plants against leaf-eating insects, along a four-fold annual precipitation gradient comprising tropical sites in Mexico and Central America. We show that the strength of the mutualism, in terms of carbon investment by plants and leaf defense by ants, increases as water availability decreases. Carbon shortages are more frequent where water is scarce and increase the risk that plants will die if all of their leaves are eaten by herbivores. Trees appear to invest more in ant defenders when water is scarce to insure themselves against extreme herbivory. Water availability thus indirectly determines the outcomes of this ant–plant mutualism, which suggests that the increasing frequency of extreme climate events in the tropics will have important ecological consequences.","Ant–plant symbiosis is an important model for understanding how mutualistic interactions affect the outcomes of species interactions. In this study, we show that plant–ant symbioses can increase the strength of carbon-based mutualism. The partners' investments in widespread ant–parasite symbiosis increase water stress at 26 sites in the Mesoamerican precipitation gradient. We show that plants invest carbon in Azteca ants phloem-feeding scale insects, which provide ants sugars, and ants provide better defense against carbon-producing leaves. We also show that the carbon trade-offs between mutualistic partners arise from carbon costs in rare extreme events such as the herbivory rainy season. In contrast, water limitation, the risk of herbivorous, increases the strength and strength of the carbon-driven mutualism in mutualistic relationships."

Compaction of repetitive sequences by heterochromatin is needed to prevent genome rearrangement and loss of genetic material. Furthermore, uncontrolled movement of mobile elements throughout the genome can result in deleterious mutations. In fission yeast, one important mechanism of heterochromatin establishment occurs through RNA interference, an RNA–dependent gene silencing process. However, it is unclear whether a direct role for RNA silencing in heterochromatin formation is conserved throughout evolution. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which harbors multiple RNA–silencing pathways that are both functionally distinct and spatially restricted, previous studies have suggested the involvement of the endogenous small interfering RNA (endo-siRNA) and Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways in heterochromatin formation. These small RNA silencing pathways suppress the expression of mobile elements in the soma or in both somatic and germline tissues, respectively. Utilizing complementary genetic and biochemical approaches, we monitored the heterochromatin state at discrete genomic locations from which both types of these small RNAs originate in endo-siRNA or piRNA pathway mutants. Our results indicate that heterochromatin can form independently of these two small RNA silencing pathways.","Heterochromatin is a highly repetitive transposable element in the genome, which is stabilized in the presence of heterochromat.

In this study, we utilized transcriptional reporters and chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify the critical factor Heterochromeatin Protein 1 (HP1). HP1 is a critical factor that is required to monitor the state of piRNA clusters, generate endo-slices, and bulk piRNAs. Surprisingly, we find that mutation of a gene that is involved in HP1 recruitment results in a genome-wide redistribution of HP1 and reduction of silencing at a distant heterochromeatic site, suggesting indirect effects on HP1 formation.

Praziquantel (PZQ) is the sole drug available to treat the disease and is administered as a racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers, of which R-PZQ is considered active. As PZQ is rapidly metabolized, its disposition and efficacy in patients might considerably vary according to disease state, sex or age. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies on the disposition of PZQ enantiomers and its main metabolite, R-trans-4-OH, in diseased patients are lacking.

They affect about 12 million people and cause a high morbidity. Since treatments against all forms of leishmaniasis are limited in number and efficacy, many efforts are made to identify potential drug targets and develop new therapies. Although considerable progress in genetic manipulation of Leishmania parasites have been made, it remains difficult to study molecules or metabolic pathways essential for parasite viability and growth. In the present work, we used a combination of gene deletion and conditional protein destabilization to demonstrate that biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar UDP-glucose and its derivative UDP-galactose is essential for parasite growth. Addition of a specific ligand to the culture medium of the engineered parasite protected the targeted enzyme from degradation and enabled cell growth and viability. However, removal of the stabilizing compound led to depletion of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose, growth arrest and cell death. This work thus opens a new possibility for the study of essential proteins.","In Leishmania parasites, the glycoinositolphospholipids galactosylation of nucleotide sugars is regulated by the UDP-glc pyrophosphorylase (UGP). UGP is an enzyme that activates galactose-1-phosphate phosphoglucomutase and is required for the biosynthesis of glucose-6–phosphatase. UGP has previously been shown to affect expression of lipophosphoglycan, resulting in reduced virulence. In this study, we show that deletion of UGP results in the depletion of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal in vitro, and that UGP does not directly affect the expression of the lipid phosphoglycan. In addition, UGP was able to maintain steady-state pools of nucleotides and preserve the normal glycoinopositolph phospholipid galacto-glycan biosynthesis, at the apparent expense of the lipophilic glycosylation. These results suggest that the absence of the UGP and USP resulted in a reduction in cell death, suggesting that metabolites/essential metabolites are essential."

They are thought to be formed from abnormally folded assemblies (PrPSc) of the host-encoded prion protein (PrPC). Different PrPSc conformational variants associated with distinct biological phenotypes, or ‘strains,’ can propagate in the same host. To gain some structural information on the physical relationship between packing order (i.e. quaternary structure) and the strain-specific biological information, we previously subjected PrPSc assemblies from prion strains classified as fast or slow (according to their survival time in susceptible laboratory animals) to sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation experiments. For the fast strains specifically, the most infectious assemblies sedimented slowly and partitioned from the bulk of PrPSc macromolecular complexes. By changing the solubilization and sedimentation conditions, we established here that a small PrPSc aggregation size and not a low density accounts for these hydrodynamic properties. We further showed that these small assemblies resist proteolytic digestion and outcompete by several orders of magnitude the larger-size assemblies in cell-free prion conversion assays. Thus PrPSc quaternary structure appears to be a determining factor of prion replication dynamics. For certain strains, a discrete subset of PrPSc assemblies appears to be the best template for prion replication.","Prions are proteinaceous infectious agents responsible for fatal neurodegenerative diseases in animals and humans. They are essentially composed of the ubiquitously expressed host-encoded prion protein (PrPC). Stable variations in the PrPSc conformation have been assumed to encode phenotypically tangible prion strains diversity. However, the direct contribution of the prPSc quaternary structure to strain biological information remains unknown. Applying a sedimentation velocity fractionation technique to a panel of ovine prions, classified fast and slow according to incubation time in ovine PrP transgenic mice, we have previously shown that the relationship between prion infectivity and PrPsc quaternaries is univocal. In fast strains specifically, infectivity was sedimented slowly segregated from the bulk proteinase-K resistant PrPs. We carefully separate their respective contributions to size density and hydrodynamic behavior, and performed sedimentation equilibrium under varied solubilization conditions. We found that the density profile and the infectivity of the bulk PrPs tended to overlap with strain, fast slow, leaving size as the main factor for the specific velocity properties of the fast strain infectious component. Our results suggest that the prion quaternarily structure is the most important factor for prion replication dynamics."

HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and there is still no effective therapeutic strategy for non-resectable HCCs. It has been suggested that the therapeutic delivery of certain miRNA(s) has a unique advantage in clinical use. We first find that the plasma levels of miR-101 are significantly down-regulated in HCC patients with distant metastasis and associated closely with HCCs progression and/or worse disease-free survival (DFS). Next, we identify that systemic delivery of lentivirus-mediated miR-101 in an orthotopic liver implanted HCC model of mouse, not only suppresses tumor xenograft growth in the liver, but also substantially blocks intrahepatic metastasis and distant metastasis to the lung and to the mediastinum, resulting in a dramatic abrogation of HCC tumorigenesis and progression in mice without toxicity. Furthermore, functional and/or mechanistic studies of miR-101 demonstrate that miR-101 in HCC cells inhibits Rho/Rac GTPase activation, and blocks HCC cells epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis, inducing a strong abrogation of HCC tumorigenesis and aggressiveness both in vitro and in vivo.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a cancer caused by the accumulation of small RNAs (miRNAs) in the liver, liver, lung, and mediastinum. In the current study, we observed that plasma levels of miR-101 were significantly lower in distant metastatic HCC patients than in HCCs with distant metastasis. Moreover, in the animal model of HCC, we demonstrated that systemic delivery of lentivirus-mediated microRNA (miRNA) abrogated HCC growth in liver, intrahepatic metastasis, and distant and metastasis in mice, thereby extending life expectancy. Furthermore, enforced overexpression of miRNA by HCC cells decreased EZH2, COX2 and STMN1, directly-regulated a novel target of ROCK2, inhibited Rho/Rho/ Rac GTPase activation, and blocked HCC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) angiogenesis, inducing strong abrogation and tumorigenesis and aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a proof-of-concept for systemic delivery and a powerful anti-HCC therapeutic modality by repressing multiple molecular targets."

The proportion of each cell type varies depending on the specific needs of the organism. We know that in the mouse embryo, specialized blood progenitor cells emerge in the fetal liver and produce mature blood cells in response to different cues. However, it is difficult to distinguish between red blood cell and white blood cell-producing progenitors with sufficiently high accuracy to study these cues. For example, we know that several childhood blood disorders, such as leukemias, are caused by genetic mutations in blood progenitor cells before birth, but studying the effects of these mutations in a mouse disease model is hampered if we don’t know which blood progenitor cells to collect. We have used different genetic markers to help distinguish red blood cell, megakaryocyte and granulocyte/monocyte-producing progenitor cells with a greater precision than was previously possible. Furthermore, to illustrate how this technique can be used to study blood disorders, we demonstrated that mutations affecting the transcription factor Runx1 impair the abilities of different progenitors to produce mature blood cells in different ways.","In recent years, highly detailed characterization of adult bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors has been achieved, as a result, the impact of somatic defects on different hematopoietic lineage fate decisions has been precisely determined.

The bacterium can trigger severe epidemics in countries with limited access to potable water and sanitation. Hygiene promotion, proper sanitation and improved access to safe drinking water are essential to control cholera. However, very few reports have described and evaluated the implementation of such activities in the field. Since October 2010, Haiti has been affected by one of the most severe cholera epidemics of the past few decades. In this report, we describe and evaluate the implementation of the original nationwide case-area targeted interventions (CATIs) response strategy, which was launched in July 2013 after years of insufficient response coordination and diminishing efforts to control cholera outbreaks in affected communities. Rapid implementation of education sessions, household decontamination, soap distribution and water chlorination in affected communities proved challenging but possible, even in a mountainous and decentralized country such as Haiti with tens of thousands of suspected cholera cases per year. Evaluation of the impact of the CATI-based strategy on the cholera epidemic is underway. Together with other components of a multi-sectoral approach, this rapid response strategy appears to be critical to eventually eliminate cholera in Haiti.","Cholera is a major public health problem in Haiti. In October 2010, Haiti was hit by a large-scale cholera epidemic. The Haitian government, UNICEF and international partners launched an unprecedented nationwide alert-response strategy in July 2013. Coordinated NGOs recruited local rapid response mobile teams to conduct case-area targeted interventions ( CATIs) including education sessions, household decontamination, chlorine spraying, and distribution of chlorine tablets. An innovative red-orange-green alert system was established to monitor the epidemic on a communal scale on a weekly basis. This study aimed to describe the exhaustiveness, intensity, and quality of CATIs in response to chola alerts in Haiti between July 2013 and June 2017.

This vision was based upon cell population-based analyses averaged over millions of cells. However, new methods have recently emerged that allow interrogation of the molecular content at the single-cell level, challenging this view with a new model suggesting that cell-to-cell gene expression stochasticity could play a key role in differentiation. We took advantage of a physiologically relevant avian cellular model to analyze the expression level of 92 genes in individual cells collected at several time-points during differentiation. We first observed that the process analyzed at the single-cell level is very different and much less well ordered than the population-based average view. Furthermore, we showed that cell-to-cell variability in gene expression peaks transiently before strongly decreasing. This rise in variability precedes two key events: an irreversible commitment to differentiation, followed by a significant increase in cell size variability. Altogether, our results support the idea that differentiation is not a “simple” series of well-ordered molecular events executed identically by all cells in a population but likely results from dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.","In recent studies, a view emerged that the stochastic dynamics governing switching cells from one state to another are characterized by peak gene expression variability at the point of fate commitment. We tested this hypothesis at the single-cell level by analyzing the primary chicken erythroid progenitors differentiation process by measuring expression of selected genes at sequential time-points during induction of differentiation. We found that single-cells gene expression data revealed high cell-to-cell variability, masked by averaging. We were able to identify a small group of functionally related genes encoding proteins involved in sterol synthesis, which act as initial drivers of differentiation, and to measure heterogeneity. In order to assess quantitatively the level of gene expression evolution over time, we used Shannon entropy to measure the heterogeneity. We observed that the previous point of maximum entropy precedes the paramount key points: irreversible commitment to differentiation from 24 to 48 h followed by a significant increase in cell size variability at 48 h. Our results indicate that the differentiation process looks different from the classical population average view. These observations are fully compatible with the idea that differentiation is a “simple” program that cells execute identically with the dynamical behavior underlying the molecular network."

To successfully trigger infection, S. Typhimurium invades epithelial cells, a process that requires the coordinated expression of a set of genes. HilD is a pivotal regulator of S.

Expression and activity of HilD are tightly regulated and respond to several environmental and physiological conditions. In this report, we introduce the transcription elongation as a novel level of regulation of hilD. We describe that the Gre factors, proteins that prevent backtracking of paused RNA polymerase complexes during transcription elongation, are required for the expression of HilD and the subsequent expression of genes involved in the invasion of epithelial cells.","The invasion of epithelial cells by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a tightly regulated process.

Arsenic is found throughout the environment from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Its inorganic forms are highly toxic and impair the physiology of most higher organisms.

In the present work, we investigated the metabolism of this metalloid in Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans, a representative organism of a novel bacterial genus widespread in aquatic environments. Examination of the genome sequence and experimental evidence revealed that it is remarkably capable of coping with arsenic. Our observations support the existence of multiple strategies allowing arsenic-metabolizing microbes to efficiently colonize toxic environments.

Similarly, our findings suggest neither a harmful nor a beneficial role of diet-derived n-6 PUFA linolenic acid in GDM pathophysiology.Our findings among pregnant women highlight the need to recognize the heterogeneous associations of individual circulating PUFAs with subsequent GDM risk and to investigate the underlying metabolism.","Pregnant women are at increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Here, we investigated the association between individual plasma phospholipid n-3 and n-6 polyFAs levels in early midpregnancy and the subsequent risk of gestational diabetes and mellitus in pregnancy. We found that individual levels of individual PUFs were significantly associated with the risk of GDM, and that individual concentrations of individual n-4 and n-(6) PUFA were positively correlated with insulin-resistance markers.

These reservoirs are a major barrier to curing HIV and have been studied intensively in this light. Latent reservoirs might also affect viral dynamics during untreated infection, because they provide an archive of old viral variants that can re-enter circulation at a later time upon activation of latently infected cells. We developed a mathematical model to investigate how reservoir dynamics affect the evolution of the virus within single hosts, and find that the presence of a latent reservoir can severely delay within-host evolutionary dynamics. This delay increases with the relative size of the reservoir and the rate at which latently infected cells proliferate. By nesting this within-host model into an epidemiological model of host population dynamics, we show that the presence of latent reservoirs can also influence the population-level evolution of the virus. In contrast to predictions made by previous models we find that population-level adaptation to maximise transmission between hosts, rather than within-host fitness, can occur, but only if adaptation of the virus within hosts is sufficiently slowed down by the presence of latent reservoirs.","The existence of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells is a major barrier to curing HIV, and has been extensively studied in light of light. However, the effect of reservoirs on the evolutionary dynamics of virus has received little attention. Here, we present a present-host quasispecies model that incorporates a long-term reservoir, nest of an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. We find that the presence of a latent reservoir severely delays evolutionary dynamics in a single host, with longer delays associated with larger relative reservoir sizes and/or homeostatic proliferation of cells in the reservoir. These delays fundamentally change the dynamics of the virus at a virus epidemiological scale. In particular, we show that the delay-in-host evolutionary dynamics is sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate viral loads consistent with maximising transmission, and that enhanced viruses similar to those that initiate infection preferentially are transmitted. These results depend on strongly-host characteristics relative to reservoir size, and the evolution of intermediate virus loads observed in-host dynamics is sufficiently delayed."

They cause disease by virtue of the fact that the eggs that they produce, which are intended for release from the host in order to allow transmission of infection, can become trapped in target organs such as the liver, where they induce damaging inflammation. Egg production by female schistosomes is critically dependent on the presence of male parasites, without which females never fully develop, and (counterintuitively) on the contribution of signals from the host's immune system. Very little is understood about the molecular basis of these interactions. Here, we describe a newly discovered schistosome gene, which is expressed in the reproductive tract of the female parasite and in parasite eggs. The protein encoded by this gene is made only when females are paired with males in an immunologically competent setting. Using recently developed tools that allow gene function to be inhibited in schistosomes, we show that the product of this gene plays a crucial role in egg development. Examining how the expression of this gene is controlled has the potential to provide insight into the molecular nature of the interactions between male and female parasites and their hosts. Moreover, the pivotal role of this gene in the egg makes it a potential target for blocking transmission and disease development.","Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by helminth parasites in the genus Schistosoma. The parasite eggs are released from the human host, but they fail to reach the external environment, instead trapped in host tissues and pathological changes caused by immune responses and secreted egg antigens precipitate the disease. Despite the central importance of egg production in transmission of disease, relatively little is known about the molecular processes underlying the development of the key life stage of schistosomes. Here, we describe a novel parasite-encoded TGF-β superfamily member, Schisto mansoni Inhibin/Activin (SmInAct), as a key process in the development and production of the parasite eggs. We show that SmInAct expression is abundantly expressed in the reproductive tissues of the adult female, and that the production of eggs aborts development. Based on real-time RT-PCR analyses, we demonstrate that the transcription of SmInact continues, albeit at a reduced level, in adult worms isolated from single-sex infections, reproduction is absent, and parasites with IL-7R−/− mice, viable egg production is severely compromised. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the embryogenesis and development of this important neglected human disease."

These important pathogens have a peculiar cell cycle in which chromosomes sometimes amplify to remarkable levels, followed by concerted cell division—providing an unusual proliferative capacity. This capacity for proliferation, combined with an ability to change the scale of replication when needed, are hallmarks of the cell cycles of these parasites. Yet the molecular mechanism responsible for these peculiar cell cycles remains one of the unsolved mysteries of Apicomplexa biology. Here we show that the centrosome—an organelle that orchestrates several aspects of the cell cycle—of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii contains specialized structures that coordinate parasite cell division. Our findings demonstrate that a two-part centrosomal architecture, comprising an inner and an outer core with distinct protein compositions, segregates the processes of mitosis from the assembly of new daughter parasites. The modular organization of the centrosome offers an explanation for how cell division can be suspended while the parasites amplify their genome to the biotic scale required for their life cycles. It is unknown whether these distinct centrosome core complexes evolved independently in Apicompexa. Another possibility is that the foundations for these mechanisms were present in the original eukaryote, which could explain how the distinct extranuclear centrosome of animal cells and the novel yeast spindle pole body of the nuclear envelope may have evolved from a common ancestor.","Apicomplexan parasites change fundamental features of their cell division and life cycles by suspending cytokinesis, which is needed for changing the proliferative scale of different hosts. The structural molecular basis of this remarkable cell cycle flexibility is not fully understood, but the centrosome serves a key role in determining how replication can occur. Here we describe the discovery of multiple replicating core complexes with distinct protein composition and function in the centroome of Toxoplasma gondii. The outer core complex of the distal nucleus contains a TgCentrin1/TgSfi1 protein pair, cartwheel protein TgSas-6, and a novel Aurora-related kinase. The inner core is closely aligned to the unique spindle pole (centrocone) and holds distant orthologs of the CEP250/C-Nap protein family. In addition, the outer/inner spatial relationship between centrosomes and cores is maintained during the cell cycle. In the metaphase, duplicated cores align opposite sides of the kinetochores in a linear array, ensuring that the daughter parasite inherits the copy type of the core. The discovery of a novel bipartite organization of the parasite centrosom segregates the functions of karyokinesis and cytokineis and provides an explanation for cell cycle versatility achieved by apicomplexans life cycles."

Recognizing the diversity of mechanisms associated with these systems is therefore critical to understanding the full signaling potential of bacterial cells. We have analyzed the behavior of two orphan, atypical response regulators that play key roles in controlling morphological differentiation in the filamentous bacteria Streptomyces-BldM and WhiI. We demonstrate that BldM activates its Group I target promoters as a homodimer, but that it subsequently activates its Group II target promoters by forming a functional heterodimer with WhiI. BldM-WhiI heterodimer formation thus represents an unusual mechanism for the coactivation of target genes and the integration of regulatory signals at promoters, enhancing the known repertoire of signaling capabilities associated with two-component systems.","Streptomyces cerevisiae is the most important bacterium in the world. It is important to understand the mechanisms by which this bacterium functions. In this study, we have defined the BldM-WhiI system as a functional heterodimer that controls the expression of Group II and Group II genes. We show that Group II gene expression depends on bldM and WhiI, and that Bldm is required for the formation of aerial hyphae and for the differentiation of reproductive structures in mature spores. We also show that the two genes are dependent on each other for their expression. We further show that this system is able to control both the expression and expression of the Group I genes."

We found that the study community members had low knowledge about the cause and mode of transmission of the disease though they knew that it is a killer and affects all age groups. More than half of the study participants believed that the disease can be transmitted from a patient to another person through breathing. In the present study area, providing information to community members through community health extension workers regarding the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of this disease, and teaching what to do to minimize mosquitoes bite in understandable way would be helpful to increase their awareness about Yellow fever.","Yellow fever (Yf) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the bite of a mosquito.

As a testament to this safety and efficacy, the 17D line of live-attenuated vaccines has become an important model for the design of future vaccines. However, we still lack a fundamental understanding of the protective immunity elicited against the virulent YFV, a knowledge gap that must be overcome to inform the design of future live-attenuated and subunit vaccines. Humans develop robust antibody and T cell responses following vaccination, leading some to suggest that vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells are important for protection against virulent YFV. Since this can never be tested in humans, we have used mice to model immunity to the 17D-204 vaccine strain. We found that CD4+ T cells elicited by 17D-204 contributed to protection against virulent YFV, but CD8+ T cells had no effect on the outcomes of survival or disease. Our study is the first to demonstrate that vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cells can protect against YFV infection. These results suggest that vaccine developers should consider the importance of CD4+ T cells when designing vaccines against viruses similar to YFV.","Yellow fever virus (YFV) is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. It is transmitted by live-attenuated 17D-based yellow fever virus vaccine (VVV) that has been shown to be safe and effective against YFV infection. However, the efficacy of VVV vaccines has not been fully evaluated. Here, we address the question of whether the immune mechanisms that underlie the protective immunity elicited by live attenuated VV vaccines elicited a long-term protection challenge, characterized by high neutralizing antibody titers and a robust T cell response formed by long-lived memory. We show that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are polyfunctional and cytolytic. Adoptive transfer of immune sera to CD4 + T cells provided partial protection against VV, and complete protection was achieved by transfer of the immun sera from CD4 to T cells. These findings suggest that robust CD4-T cell activity is a critical contributor to protective immunity that elicited highly effective VV vaccine."

The infection occurs mainly in developing countries and is associated with poverty, poor sanitation and free-range pig management. It is estimated to be responsible for 30% of cases of acquired epilepsy in endemic areas. The limited number of human studies on this infection in Sub-Saharan Africa determined a high occurrence of cysticercosis. This study aimed to learn more about the transmission dynamics of this parasite in a rural endemic area in Eastern Zambia. A longitudinal study was carried out in which 867 participants were blood sampled three times, with a 6-month interval. Samples were analysed for the presence of cysticercal circulating antigens and specific antibodies. Results indicate that about 1 on 3 people get exposed to infection while only 1 on 10 people actually acquire infection. The study shows the dynamic nature of T. solium infections; many of the people at risk become (re)infected due to the high environmental contamination, with a high number turning seronegative within a year after infection. An important number of infections probably never fully establish, leading to short-term antibody and antigen presence.","Cysticercosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite T. solium. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. The parasite is transmitted by a single bite of a mosquito, which can cause infection in humans. In this study, we tested the presence of cysticercus antigens using a monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (sero-Ag-ELISA). A randomly selected sub-sample of 161 samples from the sampling round tested for specific antibodies using a commercial enzyme-based immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) assay.

The polymorphism is driven by coevolution with parasites which are selected to evade recognition by MHC proteins. Expressing many MHC molecules could ensure that an individual could present antigens of most pathogen species encountered, but this comes at a cost, such as enhanced negative selection on lymphocytes leading to holes in T-cell receptor repertoire. Our simulations showed that evolution of the number of MHC genes in the genome is driven by a complex interaction between three factors we explored: pathogen richness, the intrinsic cost of expressing additional MHC variants, and pathogen mutation rate. In contrast to verbal arguments, our results indicate that pathogen richness does not always selects for MHC gene family expansion. Taking into account factors other than pathogen richness, in particular costs of expressing additional MHC variants which are still poorly understood, may help explain striking interspecific variation in the number of MHC genes. Counterintuitively, our results also demonstrated that opportunity for selection on immunocompetence should decrease with MHC gene family expansion.","MHC genes, code proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, have remarkable copy-number variation across species. However, the evolutionary forces driving variation are poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate the evolution of the number of MHC variants in the genome shaped by number of pathogen species that a host population encounters (pathogen richness). We found that the proportion of pathogens recognised by the host is low, and pathogen richness was high. Furthermore, we found that pathogen mutation rates were faster and faster than mutation rates when selecting an increased host MHC copy number, while pathogen diversity was low. These results suggest that the evolutionary mechanisms driving variation in vertebrate species are not well understood."

However, the genetic variants discovered from GWAS only explained a small fraction of the heritability, resulting in the question of “missing heritability”. We have recently developed approaches (called GREML) to estimate the overall contribution of all SNPs to the phenotypic variance of a trait (disease) and the proportion of genetic overlap between traits (diseases). A frequently asked question is that how many samples are required to estimate the proportion of variance attributable to all SNPs and the proportion of genetic overlap with useful precision. In this study, we derive the standard errors of the estimated parameters from theory and find that they are highly consistent with those observed values from published results and those obtained from simulation. The theory together with an online application tool will be helpful to plan experimental design to quantify the missing heritability, and to estimate the genetic overlap between traits (diseases) especially when it is unfeasible to have the traits (diseases) measured on the same individuals.","Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data have been used to estimate the genetic variance of complex traits/diseases measured in unrelated individuals. However, the proportion of phenotypic variance captured in SNPs and quantitative traits in case-control studies has not been fully revealed. We derive an approximate sampling variance estimate of genetic correlation using bivariate analysis, which is inversely proportional to the number of pairwise contrasts between analysis of variance and SNP-derived genetic relationships. We provide an online tool for calculating the power of detecting genetic (co)variation in genome-wide SNP data. This new theory is helpful to plan experimental designs to estimate missing heritability fully revealed in genome wide association studies, estimate genetic overlap between complex traits (disease) and particular traits (degenerative diseases) measured in samples."

The first step in anthrax intoxication involves binding of the toxin to a specific protein, called a receptor, on the cell surface. Receptor-binding acts like a switch to prevent the toxin from forming a pore in a cell membrane until the toxin-receptor complex is taken up into cells and delivered to a specific location (called an endosome) where it is exposed to an “acid bath”. This acidic environment promotes structural changes in the toxin leading to pore formation in the endosomal membrane. In this report, we have studied how the receptor regulates pore formation by following the associated changes in toxin-receptor contacts. These studies have defined a new toxin-receptor intermediate in the pathway leading to pore conversion and demonstrate that the receptor remains bound after pore conversion. Our results provide important new insights into how the receptor regulates anthrax toxin pore formation, information that could be useful for designing new therapeutic strategies to treat this disease.","Cellular receptors act as molecular switches, regulating the sensitivity of microbial proteins to conformational changes that promote cellular entry. However, the activities of receptor-based switches are not fully understood. In this paper, we sought to understand the mechanism underlies the activity of ANTXR2, an anthrax toxin receptor that binds to domains 2 and 4 of the protective antigen (PA) toxin subunit. Receptor-binding restricts structural changes in the heptameric PA prepore required for pore conversion to the acidic endosomal compartment. We used a transfer cross- saturation (TCS) NMR approach to monitor changes in heptamic PA-receptor contacts during different steps of prepore-to-pore conversion. Our studies demonstrated that receptor contact with PA domain 2 weakened prior to pore transformation, defining a novel intermediate pathway. Importantly, we found that the receptor-binding domain 4 remained bound to PA domain 4 following pore-conversion, suggesting that the bound receptor influence the structure and/or function of the newly formed pore. These studies provide new insights into the function of a receptor-mediated molecular switch that controls anthrax toxins entry into cells."

However, it is possible to determine the number of needed screen (NNS) to identify a treatable new AF case (i.e., Class-1 oral anticoagulation [OAC] treatment recommendation) based on the age stratum screened. The NNS-Risk profile of screened AF is known for the age and stratum, but precise cost-effectiveness sensitivity simulations were performed based on age distribution in the population/region screened. These calculations are required for national authorities and organisations responsible for health system budgets to determine best age cutoffs for screening programs and decide how programs are funded. In this study, we aimed to determine an exact yield of calculated stroke-risk profile for screen- detected AF in the 5-year and age strata screened. A systematic review of Medline, Pubmed, Embase performed (January 2007 to February 2018) and AF-SCREEN international collaboration members were contacted to identify additional studies. We found that the yield of screening was greater in males than in females in the age-stratum. The age/sex-adjusted detection rate of screening for new AF ≥65-year-olds was 1.44% (95% CI, 1.13%–1.82%) and 0.41% among people ≥65 years. The new AF detection rate increased progressively from age 0.34% ( <60 years) to 2.73% ( ≥85 years). The choice of the screening methodology device, geographical region, and screening setting influenced the detection rate for screening of new AF. Mean CHA2DS2-VASc scores (n = 1,369) increased from age 1.1 (<60years) to 3.9 (≤85 years) and increased from 72% to 70% among those with an additional stroke risk factor age/ sex. The number of screened cases was higher among people with a Class 1 OAC recommendation than among those without a Class 2 OAC."

More research is needed to understand the diverse immune responses against Mtb to develop better vaccines. Mouse Qa-1 and its human counterpart HLA-E are nonclassical MHC I molecules that can activate or inhibit immune responses in a variety of diseases. However, their role during the immune response to Mtb remains unknown. We found that Qa-1 can present Mtb peptides to activate CD8+ T effector cells during aerosol Mtb infection. Further, Mtb-infected mice that lacked Qa-1 (Qa-1-/-) had higher numbers of bacteria and died more often than infected mice that expressed Qa-1 (Qa-1+/+). The lack of Qa-1 results in over-activation of the immune response upon infection, which is less efficient in controlling Mtb. Using mice expressing different mutant forms of Qa-1, we showed that Qa-1 can regulate immune responses against Mtb through the interaction with inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptors as well as the activation of regulatory CD8+ T cells. We believe our study sheds light on the diverse mechanisms at play in generating protective immune responses against Mtb and will inform future mouse and human studies.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. MHC Ib molecules recognize distinct microbial antigens and are implicated in the immune response to Mtb infection. In this study, we identified a murine HLA-E-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) regulatory T cell line isolated from patients with active latent tuberculosis (TTB). We found that murine Qa-1 binds to numerous Mtb peptides and CD8+ T effector cells aerosolized with Mtb. We also found that mice lacking Qa (Qa-01) were more susceptible to high-dose Mtb infections compared to wild-type controls, with higher bacterial burdens and increased mortality. Furthermore, the increased susceptibility of the mutant knock-out mice was associated with dysregulated T cells and activated produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings indicate that QA-1-mediated mechanisms involved in the suppression of immune response against Mtb may be involved in suppression of Mtb immunity."

To help predict future virus emergences, we developed a model that estimates simultaneously genetic drift and selection intensities using high-throughput sequence data representing the within-host population dynamics of Potato virus Y variants differing at most by two substitutions involved in pathogenicity properties. The competitiveness costs induced by these mutations as well as the mathematical expressions of the competition coefficients of virus variants were derived from Lotka–Volterra equations. High genetic differentiation of virus populations between hosts was evidenced as well as its hump-shaped behaviour with time. The modelling framework proposed here was intended to help design control strategies aiming to prevent virus emergences.","Viruses have evolved in a variety of environments, including plants and animals. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the evolution of Potato virus Y (PVY) variants in the host plant. We found that the frequency and intensity of genetic drift experienced by viruses in host plant populations varied over time. We also showed that the competition coefficients βij exerted on the variant j variant equal fitness ratio, rj/ri. Statistical inference allowed estimation of the effect of mutation fitness on mutation fitness, revealing a slight (s = 0.45%) high (s   =  −13.2%) fitness costs and negative epistasis. Our results indicated that 1 of 4 infectious units initiated in the population of the apical leaf was initiated at the same time as the fixation index of FST.

Gene duplication and amplification (GDA) represents a simple and effective means to augment protein expression and is frequently associated with the development of resistance against antibacterial agents. As such GDAs can be seen as recent evolutionary adaptions towards novel selective pressures within the environment. We describe herein the GDA of the isd locus in a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus lugdunensis a bacterial species frequently associated with infectious endocarditis. This amplification made individual lineages significantly more successful when competing for the trace element iron supplied in the form of hemoglobin (hb). Human body fluids are actively depleted of iron to prevent bacterial proliferation and hb represents the most abundant iron source during infection. This deepens our understanding about adaption processes of pathogens and demonstrates how selective pressures drive the evolution of pathogens to become more successful. This study suggests that investigating GDAs in clinical isolates can help to identify chromosomal regions that are of special importance for bacterial fitness under changing environmental conditions. The gene products can therefore represent attractive targets for novel antibiotics supporting the natural immune defenses by targeting the vulnerable spots of the bacterial anti-immunity strategies.,"Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase negative bacterial pathogen that is particularly associated with severe cases of infectious endocarditis. In this study, we have duplicated the isd locus of this bacterium and duplicated it in the HKU09-01 duplication. The isd is intrinsically unstable and undergoes accordion-like amplification segregation leading to extensive isd copy number variation. Amplification of the locus increased the level of expression of Isd proteins and improved the binding of hemoglobin to the cell surface of S. lugdungensis. Furthermore, Isd overexpression provided an advantage to strains competing with limited hemoglobin as the sole source of iron. Gene duplications amplifications (GDA) events are a fundamental importance in bacterial evolution and are frequently associated with antibiotic resistance and species of antibiotic resistance. This is the first time that a virulence factor of a Gram-positive pathogen can link GDA directly to its competitive advantage against bacteria struggling with selective pressures mimicking “nutritional immunity”."

These bacteria can rapidly spread through a population through a process of cytoplasmic incompatibility whereby females uninfected by Wolbachia show embryo death when they mate with males carrying the bacteria. Because the infected females pass on Wolbachia to their offspring, this places them at a reproductive advantage, ensuring that the infection spreads through insect populations once it reaches a high enough frequency to overcome any negative fitness effects on its host. Yet while such a rapid spread has been predicted, it has rarely been observed in nature. Here we show that a Wolbachia infection of Drosophila simulans flies has spread very rapidly in eastern Australia, replacing another Wolbachia infection that has also spread in recent years. These invasions appear to have taken place from a very low frequency, implying that both infections are likely to have had a benefit to their hosts rather than a cost. These results have implications for the spread of Wolbachia infections currently being introduced into populations of mosquitoes and other insects for disease suppression.","Maternally inherited intracellular bacteria Wolbachia manipulate host reproduction in ways that foster frequency and increases in host populations. Manipulations involving cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) are common in arthropods that produce non-viable embryos. CI is associated with the spread of a Wolbachiae variant wRi in Californian populations of Drosophila simulans, interpreted as a bistable wave, and local infection frequencies tend to increase when infection is sufficiently common to offset imperfect maternal transmission and infection costs. We describe the sequential spread of two Wolbachias variants (wRi and wAu) in natural populations from the east coast of Australia, which causes significant CI, with wRI displacing wAU 2004. We also describe the dynamics of the earlier spread in California, best understood by Fisherian waves and favourable variants, and suggest that local spread tends to occur arbitrarily low frequencies."

Identifying areas risk cholera support development implementation policies minimize morbidity mortality disease .","Cholera has been increasingly reported in the past decade. It is most feared because of its tendency to spread rapidly resulting in deaths in a short time, if appropriate treatment is not provided. For fear of trade and travel sanctions, countries were disinclined to report cholera, unless large outbreaks ensued. Although countries in Asia have been reporting cholera, it is believed that more cases are not being identified and instead being reported as acute watery diarrhea. Cholera is endemic in the Philippines however data on cholera in the country remained sparse, until 2008 when surveillance was strengthened. From 2008 to 2013, 42,071 suspected and confirmed cholera cases were reported in 87% of provinces and metropolitan areas in the country, confirming the endemicity of cholera in the Philippines. Poor access to improved sanitation was associated with cholera. On the other hand despite access to improved water sources, cholera remains to be seen. The latter is most probably due to the breakdown and non-chlorination of water systems. We identified areas where cholera has been known to occur in the Philippines, this will assist in the development and implementation of policies to minimize the morbidity and mortality due to this disease.","Cholera is a tropical disease caused by the bacterium cholera, which is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito. Cholera can be fatal if not treated with appropriate treatment. In this study, we used PubMed and ProMED searches for information from 2008–2013 and event-based surveillance reports from 2010–2013, to assess the epidemiology of chola in the Philippines. Using spatial log regression, we identified 12 articles from ProMED PubMed reported in chola Philippines between 2008 and 2013. Data from ProMed surveillance revealed 42,071 suspected confirmed and confirmed cases in 2008 and 5,006 confirmed cases between 2013 and 2014. The overall case fatality ratio was 0.62%, 2% outbreaks per 100,000 population. We found that poor access to improved sanitation was consistently associated with higher chola incidence in suspected and confirmed confirmed cases. Paradoxically, access improved water sources were associated with a higher chOLera incidence than suspected confirmed cases and data sources. Our findings highlight the need to maintain infrastructure and non-chlorination water supplies, emphasizing the need for maintain public water systems."

Since diet is known to influence the rate of aging, animals seem to have evolved intricate mechanisms to maintain homeostasis and normal life span, but the molecular mechanisms are less understood. Using a small nematode, C. elegans as a model, we show that the adaptive capacity to different diet is maintained by a kinase gene. When this gene is mutated, worms start living longer on one strain of bacterial diet but not on the other. We identify the molecular cascade required for this food-type-dependent longevity. We show that this cascade of events significantly overlaps with the pathway that determine food quantity-dependent life span enhancement. Our study thus elucidates a part of the molecular monitoring system that regulates longevity dependent on the available quality and quantity of diet.","C. elegans is one of the most important animals in the world, and it is known that it is able to adapt its physiology to different food-types, modulating complex life-history traits like aging.

We show that the flr-4 mutant, E. coli HT115 (K12 strain) and standard diet OP50 (B strain) are able to activate p38MAPK, elevate expression of cytoprotective genes and nuclear hormone receptor NHR-8, and enhance life span. Interestingly, the two genes utilize similar pathways for longevity assurance, suggesting cross-talk between cellular modules that respond to diet quality and quantity."

In the environment, L. pneumophila survives and replicates within protozoa by co-opting the intracellular machinery of these microbial predators. These freshwater encounters between bacteria and protozoa likely provided L. pneumophila with the selective pressures required to evolve into an intracellular pathogen. Many of the host pathways that L. pneumophila manipulates during infection are highly conserved and this is presumably what allows L. pneumophila to infect human cells. It is likely that L. pneumophila is suboptimally adapted to replication within mammalian cells, however, as replication within human cells is thought to be an evolutionary dead end. In this study, we developed an experimental evolution approach to determine what unique selective pressures might be present within mammalian hosts and how these pressures might modify this pathogen. We subjected L. pneumophila to continuous passage within mouse macrophages for several months, selecting for spontaneous mutations that resulted in improved fitness within these cells. We sequenced the genomes of each of the adapted strains, measured the population dynamics of each evolving population, and identified mutations that improve replication in mammalian cells and alter bacterial fitness in amoebae.","Legionella pneumophila is an accidental intracellular pathogen that infects humans. The bacterium has been known to infect humans for hundreds of generations, but it has never been studied in humans. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that restricting L. pneumophil growth in mouse macrophages over hundreds of years led to improved replication of macrophage. Based on our results, we provide a detailed view of population dynamics in experimentally evolving bacterial population, punctuated by frequent instances of transient clonal interference and selective sweeps. Non- synonymous point mutations in the flagellar regulator, fleN, resulted in increased uptake of lysine and broadly increased replication in macrophaging and amoebae. Mutations in multiple steps of the lysines biosynthesis pathway were independently isolated, resulting in increased replication of amoaebae and reduced replication of the macrophae. Our results demonstrate that, in laboratory conditions, host restriction is sufficient to rapidly modify L. pneumoniaophila fitness in the host range."

The collection of BV prevalence may therefore also be important.Developing new cohorts for dedicated STI/BV prevalence studies may not be realistic, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the impact of STIs/BV and their consequences may be greatest.Nesting STI/BV surveys within networks of health and demographic surveillance sites (HDSSs) would be an efficient way of providing data to better understand STI epidemiology among adolescents and young people in high HIV prevalence settings.We carried out a nested STI/BV survey among 1,342 adolescent and young people in an HDSS in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between October 2016 and January 2017.Potential participants were contacted at home and invited to participate.Participants were interviewed, and samples were collected for STI/BV testing.We showed that this study was feasible within the 3.5-month time period: 1,171/1,342 (87%) individuals had ≥1 attempted home visit, of whom 790 (67%) were successfully contacted.The study was acceptable: among those contacted and eligible, 447/645 (69%) enrolled. Both men and women reported few problems with sample collection.We report a high burden of STIs/BV in this population, particularly of chlamydia (5% in men and 11% in women), herpes simplex virus type 2 (17% in men and 29% in women), and BV (42% in women).Nested STI/BV surveys in HDSSs can be feasible and acceptable; however, more survey time is needed to ensure that all potential participants are visited and contacted.These studies should be carried out in conjunction with studies to measure STI/BV prevalence in high-risk populations (e.g., female sex workers) to provide robust prevalence estimates.These data are essential to advocate, fund, plan, implement, and evaluate interventions for STI prevention and control among adolescents and young people.Strategies for the prevention and control of chlamydia, herpes simplex virus type 2, and BV are needed in this population.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) are associated with increased transmission of HIV, poor reproductive sexual health, and poor sexual health.

We conducted an acceptability, feasibility, and prevalence study of home-based sampling for STIs and BV in young men and women aged 15–24 years old at a health demographic surveillance site (HDSS) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A total of 1,342 young people, stratified by age (15–19 20–24years) sex, were selected for the HDSS sampling frame; 1,171/1,342 (87%) individuals ≥1 attempted a home visit between 4 October 2016 and 31 January 2017, 790 (67%) were successfully contacted and 645 (69%) were enrolled.

Nonetheless, how new neurons are integrated in the existing circuits and contribute to memory formation still awaits clarification. Toward this end, we have developed a different approach, using a mouse model that accelerates the differentiation of the newly generated neurons without altering their number, and offers the possibility to induce the process at any chosen moment. We show that the new neurons pass through their early stages of maturation faster and, though establishing connections with the existing neuronal circuits, fail to function properly. In fact, mice are not only unable to learn new spatial information, but they are also unable to use previously acquired memories. These results demonstrate that the appropriate timing of maturation of new neurons is important for their adult performance in memory circuits, i.e., to integrate new memory traces and recall previous events.","Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus plays a critical role in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. It remains unknown, however, how new neurons are functionally integrated into spatial circuits and how they contribute to hippocampus-mediated forms of learning and memory. To investigate these issues, we used a mouse model of the differentiation of adult-generated neurons. In contrast to previous studies, we predicted that the number of newly generated neurons would be affected by a strategy that selectively changes the timing of differentiation. New, adult-derived neurons were significantly reduced in dendritic arborization and spine density. Functionally, genetic manipulation specifically affected different hippocamp-dependent learning memory tasks, including contextual fear conditioning, and selectively reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Morphological functional analyses of hippocampal neurons at different stages of differentiation, following transgene activation and defined time-windows, revealed that new, adult–generated neurons were 3–4 weeks of age required to acquire new spatial information and use previously consolidated memories. These results suggest that correct unwinding of key memory functions, such as the ability of the adult-genesis to link subsequent events to memory circuits, is critically dependent on the correct timing of initial stages of neuron maturation and the connection between existing circuits."

We have created a model that uses a small number of assumptions to demonstrate a plausible set of circuitry. Since bees only extract an estimate of angular velocity they show differences from the expected behaviour for perfect angular velocity detection, and our model reproduces these differences.","The honeybee brain is a complex network of sensory neurons that can be used to monitor the movement of insects. In this work, we present a novel neurally based model for estimating angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain, capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry in corridor-centering free-flying honeybees, including previously unaccounted manipulations of behaviour. Our model fitted electrophysiological data, tested behavioural data, and tested the behavioural data. Based on our model, we suggest that the AV response may be considered an evolutionary extension of the optomotor response. We show that the detector reproduces the invariance of average flight path and spatial frequency in contrast to gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behaviour found in real bee behaviour. In addition, we demonstrate that the response of the detector unit to distance movement in the corridor is constant across a large range of grating and spatial frequencies, demonstrating the detector as a visual odometer."

Photosynthetic membranes in chloroplasts contain high levels of glycolipids, and UDP-galactose is a dominating donor for glycolipid biosynthesis. Although glycolipid assembly of photosynthetic membranes has been characterized at the genetic and enzymatic level, the mechanism of substrate supply of UDP-galactose for the glycolipid biosynthetic pathway remains obscure. By genetic screening of rice mutants that are impaired in photosynthetic capacity and carbon assimilation, we identified PHD1 as a novel nucleotide sugar epimerase involved in a process of glycolipid biosynthesis and participating in photosynthetic membrane biogenesis. PHD1 was preferentially expressed in green and meristem tissues, and the PHD1 protein was targeted to chloroplasts. We revealed that UDP-galactose for glycolipid biosynthesis catalyzed by the new enzyme was generated inside chloroplasts, and the reduced amounts of glycolipids in the mutant led to decreased chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity. Overexpression of this gene lead to growth acceleration, enhanced photosynthetic efficiency, and finally improved biomass and grain yield in rice. These results suggest that PHD1 has significant economic implications in both traditional crop improvement and bioenergy crop production.","Photosynthesis is the final determinator of crop yield. To gain insight into genes controlling photosynthetic capacity, we selected a large T-DNA mutant population of rice that was stunted and had decreased carbon assimilate yield production. We identified the gene photoassimilate defective1 (phd1), which encodes a novel chloroplast-localized UDP-glucose epimerase (UGE) that is conserved throughout the plant kingdom. We found that PHD1 encodes an enzyme that encodes the novel UDP-glycerol-localizing UDP-galaase (UGG) and that UGE activity was significantly lower in the phd1-1 mutant wild type than in the wild type. In addition, amounts of UDP-lucose and UDP-galactose substrates in chloroplasts were significantly higher and lower, respectively, indicating that PHd1 is responsible for the major UGE activities in plastids. Our findings are useful in improving crop yields and bioenergy crop engineering."

Most multicellular animals contain multiple IIS ligands, including 7 in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (DILP1-7), implying that the diverse functions of IIS could in part be mediated by the functional diversification of the ligands. Although Drosophila is a prime model organism to study IIS, knowledge about the function of individual DILPs is still very limited due to the lack of gene-specific mutants. Therefore, we generated mutants for all 7 dilp genes and systematically analyzed their phenotypes. We show that loss of DILP2 extends lifespan and describe a novel role for DILP6 in growth control. Furthermore, we show that DILPs are evolutionary conserved and can act redundantly, supporting the hypothesis that functional redundancy itself can be of evolutionary advantage. We also describe a specific interaction between IIS and the endosymbiontic bacterium Wolbachia in lifespan regulation. This finding has implications for all longevity studies using IIS mutants in flies and offers the opportunity to study IIS as a mechanism involved in host/symbiont interactions. Finally, we show that DILPs mediate the response of lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction.","The insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway plays key roles in growth, metabolism, stress resistance, reproduction, and longevity in diverse organisms including mammals. Invertebrate genomes contain multiple genes encoding insulin-like ligands, including seven Drosophila insulin-Like peptides (DILPs). We investigated the evolution, diversification, redundancy, and functions of DILPs, combining evolutionary analysis, based on newly-generated knock-down of 7 dilp genes in D. melanogaster, and functional analysis. Diversification of 7 DILP genes preceded diversification of D. species, suggesting a stable gene diversification and family membership, suggesting stabilising selection and gene function. Gene knock-outs demonstrated synergy between gene expression and expression of different DILp genes, notably DilP3 required for normal expression of the two 5 brain neurosecretory cells. Loss of the loss of the brain genes resulted in increased lifespan, but loss of these genes did not affect fertility, contrary to the proposed role of Drososymbiontic bacterium Wolbachia in lifespan regulation. Importantly, loss of brain genes produced in the brain greatly extended lifespan in the presence of endosysymbiosis and the pathogenesis of the bacterium, demonstrating a specific interaction between IIS and Wolbachiae lifespan regulation, suggesting that IIS extends lifespan mechanisms that overlap DR."

Modifications of these sites have been postulated to function in gene regulation, potentially via interactions with transcription factors. In this study, we hypothesized that DNA methylation signals contain valuable information that can help infer transcription factors that may be associated with a given disease. Here, we utilize the vast repository of breast cancer data that is available in the public domain, and which contains a rich resource for DNA methylation and clinical data on breast cancer patients. In this guilt-by-association analysis, we postulated that conserved transcription factor binding motifs that are statistically enriched in regions near methylated CpG sites that are correlated with breast cancer patient survival would suggest that their cognate transcription factors would play a role in the initiation, growth, metastasis, or even suppression of the tumor. This integrative approach supports the claim that DNA methylation profiling of patient tumors in the clinic may contain valuable information that can guide the development of treatment regimens for individual patients; thus contributing to the progression of precision medicine.","The regulatory architecture of breast cancer is extraordinarily complex and misregulation can occur at very low levels.

Studies in plants are advantageous for elucidation of specific effects of PcGs during development, since most PcG mutants are viable in plants but not in animals. Previous efforts in genetic study of plant PcGs revealed that different PcGs have both common and unique effects on plant development, but the mechanisms underlying the specific regulation of different developmental programs by PcGs are still far from clear. In this study, we quantitatively compared the change in H3K27me3 and gene expression profiles between mutants of key PcG members on a genome-wide scale in Arabidopsis seedlings, and successfully unraveled different developmental programs that are specifically regulated by different combinations of PcGs. This context specific effect of PcGs is closely associated with different sets of transcription factor binding motifs. Together, we revealed on a genome-wide scale that different combinations of PcGs, as well as their association with the binding sites of different TFs, serve to explain the specific regulation of different developmental programs by PcGs.","Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play crucial roles in transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in plants and animals. In plants, depletion of different members of PRCs causes overlapping and unique phenotypic defects. However, the underlying molecular mechanism determining target specificity and functional diversity is not sufficiently characterized. Here, we quantitatively compared changes in tri-methylation of H3K27 in Arabidopsis mutants deprived of key PRC components. We found that CURLY LEAF (CLF), a major catalytic subunit of PRC2, coordinates the expression of different PRC1 components in distinct plant developmental programs. We also found that expression of flower development genes repressed in seedlings is preferentially associated with CLF, specifically associated with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN and PROTEIN1 (LHP1). In contrast, expression of embryo development genes is repressed by PRC3-catalytic core subunits of AtBMI1 and AtRING1, which are common with the other PRC 2-catalyst enzymes CLF SWINGER (SWN) and SWN. The context-dependent role of CLF corresponds to a change in H3C27me3 profiles, remarkably associated with differential co- occupancy binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs), including MADS box and ABA-related factors. Thus, we propose that different combinations of these PRC members distinctively regulate different developmental programs, and target specificity may be modulated by specific TFs."

While the genome for Ae. aegypti has been sequenced, it is in many pieces which have not yet been arranged on chromosomes. To this end, we have created a genetic linkage map and measured the distance between genetic markers, which allows us to assign them to regions of the genome. Using this method, we also detected errors in the current genome sequences. We used our genetic map to find regions of the mosquito genome associated with the development of Brugia malayi, a nematode that causes lymphatic filariasis in humans. A better genome assembly will be important for the development of novel methods for controlling disease transmission.","Mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits important human arboviruses, including dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses.

We also found that large regions of the genome that are suppressed by recombination, centromeres, extend to 47% of the chromosome.

These drugs target enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that build the essential cell wall that surrounds bacterial cells. Beta-lactams have long been used as chemical and genetic probes to uncover the mechanisms required for proper bacterial cell wall biogenesis. In this report, we use a high-throughput genetic approach to comprehensively identify nearly all genetic loci that promote resistance to the beta-lactam mecillinam in the model organism Escherichia coli. Moreover, by performing our analysis in several different genetic backgrounds we were able to generate a rich resource that defines those alleles that promote resistance by inducing a stress response and those that are more likely to do so by directly modulating cell wall synthesis. Further characterization of one of the stress response-independent resistance loci helped us discover that enzymes that cleave crosslinks in the cell wall are capable of activating cell wall synthesis by a subset of PBPs. Our analysis of the activation mechanism challenges the prevailing view in the field that cell wall synthases and cell wall cleaving enzymes must work in multi-enzyme complexes to assemble the cell wall.","Bacterial cells are surrounded by a net-like macromolecule called the cell wall constructed by the heteropolymer peptidoglycan (PG). Biogenesis matrix targets the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that bind to the nascent wall material, preventing crosslinking between the nascent cell wall and the existing network. In Escherichia coli, beta-lactam mecillinam is a drug that targets the PBP2 enzyme in the cell elongation machinery. Low-throughput selections of mecillinsam resistance loci have historically been useful for defining mechanisms involved in cell wall biogenesis and killing the activity of beta-Lactam antibiotics. In this study, we used transposon-sequencing (Tn-Seq) to identify nearly all of the genes involved in resistance to the drug in E. coli genome, providing a comprehensive resource for uncovering new mechanisms underlying PG assembly and drug resistance. Our analysis revealed that the overproduction of endopeptidase enzymes that cleave crosslinks between the wall and PBPs promotes the production of a subset of PBPs. This activation mechanism suggests that, contrary to the prevailing view in the field, PG synthases and PG cleaving enzymes need to function as multi-enzyme complexes to expand the bacterial cell wall matrix."

Hence, it is important to understand the different mechanisms underlying gain modulation. Earlier work focused on gain modulation in mature networks with functional connectivity; however, the mechanisms of gain control in the developing brain are still unclear. We show here that asynchronous release of neurotransmitter, a form of synaptic “noise” that is strongly expressed in synapses of the developing brain, and short-term synaptic plasticity can efficiently modulate the gain of the synapse without a priori assumptions about network's connectivity. Asynchronous release depends on the activity-dependent accumulation of synaptic calcium. We show that changes in asynchronous release can have either a divisive or multiplicative effect on the gain, depending on the state of the neuronal membrane conductance. Thus, activity-dependent synaptic “noise” can regulate the information flow at synapses, and its impact on the neuron is flexibly modulated by neuronal membrane conductance.","Neurons are highly sensitive to external stimuli. In this study, we show that the early development of GABAergic interneurons and excitatory mechanisms of asynchronous transmitter release contribute to regulating neuronal sensitivity. We modeled how phasic asynchronous synaptic transmission in early development and study the impact of activity-dependent noise and short-term plasticity on synaptic gain. Asynchronous release decreased the increased gain depending on membrane conductance. The high shunt regime was divisive, while the low shunt regimes had a nearly multiplicative effect on firing rate. In addition, sensitivity correlated with inputs influenced by shunting and asynchronous release in opposite ways. We also modeled how asynchronous release can regulate information flow between synapses and impact flexibly modulated membrane conductances."

There are numerous mechanisms within the cell, collectively referred to as protein quality control (PQC), that verify proper folding. If abnormal folding is detected, PQC can either help the protein to refold or target it for degradation. Failures in protein folding and PQC lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which often self-associate into large aggregations that are thought to be the underlying cause of several neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we use the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to understand how cells handle disease-associated misfolded proteins. In a large-scale genetic screen, we discovered two suppressor genes, ufd-2 and spr-5, which encode a ubiquitin ligase and a lysine-specific demethylase, respectively. When these two proteins are inactivated, we observe a marked reduction in the toxicity of several misfolded proteins. ufd-2 and spr-5 are conserved in humans (UBE4B and LSD1, respectively), as are their effects on misfolded proteins. We show that UBE4B and LSD1 regulate the activity of protein degradation machineries including the proteasome and autophagosomes. Using microarrays and biochemical analyses, we identify p53 as a key downstream transcription factor that mediates the action of UBE4B and LSD1 on protein clearance. This work establishes p53 as a regulator of proteome integrity and uncovers a new protein quality control pathway that could potentially be exploited to increase the degradation of misfolded proteins in diseased cells.","Protein quality control is essential for the clearance of misfolded aggregated proteins in a cell, a failure associated with neurodegenerative disorders.

Loss of human orthologs of ubiquitination factor E4 B (UBE4B) and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LS1), respectively encoding ubiquitin ligase, promotes the clearance and autophagic degradation machineries. We identify a downstream effector transcription factor p53, shared with the substrate of UBE4A and LSD1, as a key regulator of protein quality control and to protect against proteotoxicity. Our studies identify a new pathway for the regulation of transcription factors and point to the augmentation of protein quantity control as a wide-spectrum antiproteotoxicity strategy."

Thus, understanding their molecular mechanism is of utmost importance.

For proper function, a protein complex should facilitate transduction between the interacting proteins. Therefore the complex’s dynamics should reveal whether it is obligatory or non-obligatory. Indeed, normal mode analysis shows that the dynamic domains of obligatory complexes often mix segments from the interacting chains. In contrast, in non-obligatory complexes the inter-chain interface often hinges between dynamic domains, held together through few anchor residues. An automated methodology based on these observations correctly classifies over 80% of the interfaces in a test set.

Biofilms are complex multicellular communities in which cells exhibit distinct properties to those grown in suspension. They are particularly relevant in the development of device-associated infections, and thus understanding biofilm regulation and biofilm architecture is a priority. C. albicans has the ability to form different types of biofilms under different environmental conditions. Here, we compare the regulation of biofilm formation in conventional biofilms, for which a core transcriptional network has recently been identified, with pheromone-stimulated biofilms, which occur when C. albicans white cells are exposed to pheromone. Our studies show that several regulatory components control biofilm formation under both conditions, including the network transcriptional regulators Bcr1, Brg1, Rob1, and Tec1. However, other transcriptional regulators are specific to each model of biofilm development. In particular, we demonstrate that Cph1, the master regulator of the pheromone response during mating, is essential for pheromone-stimulated biofilm formation but is dispensable for conventional biofilms. These studies provide an in-depth analysis of the regulation of pheromone-stimulated biofilms, and demonstrate that both shared and unique components operate in different models of biofilm formation in this human pathogen.","Candida albicans is a bacterium that causes a variety of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.

In a mouse embryo, UBF was essential for embryo development and morula development. Conditional deletion of cell cultures reveals that UBF remains essential for transcription of rRNA genes and defines the active chromatin conformation of gene enhancer sequences. Loss of the UBF prevents formation of the SL1/TIF1B pre- initiation complex and recruitment of the RPI-Rrn3/PIF1A complex, which is accompanied by recruitment of H3K9me3, canonical histone H1 and HP1α, and de novo DNA methylation. In contrast to canonical H1, H2A.Z binds H1.4 and is dependent on UBF, strongly suggesting that this protein plays a positive role in gene activity. Unexpectedly, arrest of RRNA synthesis may suppress transcription of 5S, tRNA snRNA genes, and expression of mRNA genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis."

During this process, each edited transcript can undergo hundreds of cleavage/ligation events as U-residues are inserted or deleted to generate a translatable open reading frame. A major paradox has been why this incredibly metabolically expensive process would evolve and persist. In this work, we show that many of the mitochondrial genes in trypanosomes are dual-coding, utilizing different reading frames to potentially produce two very different proteins. Access to both reading frames is made possible by alternative editing of the 5’ end of the transcript. We hypothesize that dual-coding genes may work to protect the mitochondrial genes from mutations during growth in the mammalian host, when many of the mitochondrial genes are not being used. Thus, the complex RNA editing system may be maintained because it provides a unique molecular strategy to combat genetic drift.","Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that infects the tsetse fly. The parasite lives in the bloodstream of the fly, where it is continuously replicating in its bloodstream. In this stage, the mitochondrion lacks a functional electron transport chain (ETC). Successful transition from the fly to the fly requires activation of the ETC and ATP synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. This life cycle leads to a major problem: in this part of the bloodstream, mitochondrial genes are subject to genetic drift that endangers their integrity. Exacerbating, T. bruceis undergoes repeated population bottlenecks that evade the host immune system and create additional forces of genetic drift. Here, we show that a complex RNA editing system found in the mitochondria of trypanosomes provides a unique molecular strategy to combat genetic drift under non-selective conditions."

Age at menarche (AAM) is related to many common female health problems. AAM is mainly determined by genetic factors. However, the specific genes and the associated mechanisms underlying AAM are largely unknown. Here, taking advantage of the most recent technological advances in the field of human genetics, we identified multiple genetic variants in a gene, SPOCK, which are associated with AAM variation in a group of Caucasian women. This association was subsequently confirmed not only in two independent groups of Caucasian women but also across ethnic boundaries in one group of Chinese women. In addition, SPOCK has a function in regulating a key factor involved in menstrual cycles, MMP-2, which provides further support to our findings. Our study provides a solid basis for further investigation of the gene, which may help to reveal the underlying mechanisms for the timing of menarche and for AAM's relationship with women's health in general.","Age menarche (AAM) is a significant physiological event in women.

Cysteine proteases from Leishmania are important virulence factors and, therefore, interesting drug targets. Studies on inhibitors against these enzymes during Leishmania major infection in mice had shown that host equivalents of these proteases are also affected, namely cathepsin B and cathepsin L. The inhibition of cathepsin B resulted in immune-mediated protection, while inhibition of cathepsin L caused susceptibility to the parasite. In the present study, we investigated the effect of cathepsin deficiency on the signals used by dendritic cells to orchestrate the T helper (Th)-mediated immune response against L. major and the control of parasite proliferation within infected macrophages. The results demonstrate that cathepsin B-deficient dendritic cells express higher levels of the antigen-presenting MHC class II molecules than WT and cathepsin L-deficient cells. Surprisingly, dendritic cells and macrophages deficient for cathepsin B showed higher expression of the protective Th1-inducing cytokine IL-12. Therefore, we propose a novel role of this protease as a regulator of cytokine expression. Altogether, these findings suggest that cathepsin B down-regulates the Th1 response to L. major, and, in its absence, antigen-presenting cells express signals protecting against the parasite.","Leishmania major is the causative agent of Leishmania infection in humans and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we generated bone- marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and macrophages (BMM) from mice infected with L. major. We found that MHC class II co-stimulatory molecules (MHC class I and MHC classes II) were expressed in the BMDC and BMM cells, but not in the BMM and Ctsl−/− mice. Furthermore, we found that the expression of MHC-class II molecules in the mice was significantly different in BMM, Ctsb, and BMDC. These findings suggest that the MHC/MHC classes I-stimulator molecules may regulate the Th1/Th2 response in the mouse. Moreover, we propose a novel role for BMM as a regulator of cytokine expression."

We found that the students being taught genetics first had a 5%–10% improvement in their understanding of evolution, above that shown in the group taught evolution first. The change was seen in both higher- and foundation-ability classes. Indeed, in the foundation classes the genetics-first approach was the only approach that enabled an increase in evolution understanding. Teaching genetics first comes at no cost to genetics understanding (and may even improve it). However, the genetics-first approach was no different from the evolution-first approach in helping the acceptance of evolution.

Chikungunya and West Nile viruses (WNV), both mosquito-borne RNA viruses, are quintessential examples of how increased globalization has facilitated the expansion of viruses into new territories. Rapid evolution of both of these agents has contributed to their rapid spread and health burden. Thus, characterizing how selection shapes zoonotic RNA viruses in their natural hosts is important to understand their emergence. As an ecological generalist able to infect hundreds of bird species, WNV is an excellent tool to study how different animal hosts can differentially drive virus evolution. We examined the genetic composition and fitness of WNV produced during replication in wild-caught American crows, house sparrows and American robins, species that range in mortality following WNV infection (crows the highest, robins the lowest). We demonstrate host-dependent effects on WNV population structure and fitness. Our study provides insights on how different virus-animal interactions can influence the success of a virus in the next host and ultimately the success of virus emergence into new host systems.","The emergence of RNA viruses is a major public health problem in the developing world.

We also show that WNV replication in disease-prone bird species is positively associated with virulence, likely due to complementation.

However, recent evidence has shown that DNA methylation, which can control gene expression, is also highly dysregulated in cancer and contributes to carcinogenesis. Whether methylation alterations correspond to mutated driver genes in cancer remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed 4,302 tumors from 18 cancer types and demonstrated that driver gene mutations are inherently connected with the aberrant DNA methylation landscape in cancer. We showed that driver gene–associated methylation patterns can classify heterogeneous tumors within a cancer type into homogeneous subtypes and have the potential to influence genes that contribute to tumor growth. This finding could help us better understand the fundamental connection between driver gene mutations and DNA methylation alterations in cancer, and to further improve cancer treatment.","Tumor genome-wide changes in methylation patterns are a hallmark of cancer. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that the landscapes of tumor genomes and epigenomes are tightly interconnected. We measured the relationship between the principal component analyses of methylation-mutant associations applied at the nucleotide level with respect to genome-scale trends. We found that mutations in driver genes associated with genome-specific patterns of aberrant hypomethylation and CpG island hypermethylation in specific cancer types. In addition, we identified associations between 737 mutated driver genes and site-specific methylation changes in thyroid cancer subtypes. These results establish that driver gene mutations associated with methylation alterations are capable of shaping regulatory network functions, and improve treatment efficacy."

Recent knowledge about the genital manifestations of schistosomiasis; especially its possible association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, has led to increased focus on this neglected tropical disease. Millions of women remain undiagnosed for genital schistosomiasis, and may suffer from abnormal mucosal blood vessels, contact bleeding and lesions named sandy patches. This study analyses a unique selection of female genital biopsies containing parasite eggs. Protein detection and standard histopathological assessment are combined to quantify and study the characteristics of the mucosal blood vessels surrounding the eggs. Our results show that the genital mucosa with parasite eggs is more vascularised compared to healthy tissue, and that viable eggs tend to be surrounded by proliferating blood vessels. These findings have not yet been correlated directly to clinical manifestations. Further studies are needed in order to provide clinical advice on the risks and consequences of mucosal lesions particular to female genital schistosomiasis.","Female genital schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Schistosoma haematobium, which is transmitted to humans through the genital mucosa of the female genital tract.

The aim of this study was to quantify the characteristics of the vasculature surrounding the parasite and to identify the factors that influence the risk of HIV infection. In this study, we found that the blood vessels surrounding the infected parasite were significantly vascularised compared to the healthy cervical mucosa. In addition, the blood vessel proliferation was associated with granulation of tissue surrounding viable compared to calcified ova (p = 0.032) and the tendency of neovascularisation of the tissue surrounding the viable ova compared to healthy cervical tissue. Our findings suggest that female genital lesions are associated with the presence of granulation and tissue rich in sprouting blood vessels."

This is done through a complex network of reactions controlled by many genes. Changes in cellular metabolism play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, despite the availability of genome sequences and of genome-scale expression data, which give information about which genes are present and how active they are, our ability to use these data to understand changes in cellular metabolism has been limited. We present a new approach to this problem, linking gene expression data with models of cellular metabolism. We apply the method to predict the effects of drugs and agents on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Virulence, growth in human hosts, and drug resistance are all related to changes in M. tb's metabolism. We predict the effects of a variety of conditions on the production of mycolic acids, essential cell wall components.

These secretion systems have a pore formed by secretin protein subunits through which the disease causing protein effectors and toxins pass. The secretin must be targeted to and assembled in the outer-membrane and a pilotin protein facilitates this process. In the absence of the pilotin the secretin is degraded or mislocates to the inner-membrane, in either case the secretion system in non-functional and the bacterium cannot cause disease. Here we show how the pilotin and the secretin of the type II secretion system interact, these insights may be useful for the development of antibacterial compounds to interfere with secretin targeting and assembly and defeat pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic E. coli which infect man and Dickeya dadantii which threatens food security.","Gram-negative bacteria secrete virulence factors that assemble fibre structures on the cell surface and specialized secretion systems. In this study, we describe the crystal structure of the pilotins of T2SS, T3SS and T4PS, which are characterized by large outer membrane channels formed by proteins called secretins. Usually, the cognate lipoprotein pilot is essential for the assembly of secretin in the outer membrane. However, the molecular mechanism of the process is poorly understood. Here, we report a crystal structure that is profoundly different from previously solved pilotins. The architecture is described by insertion of the α-helical hairpin into the second open α- helical hairpins and bent the final helix. We show that pilotin binds tightly to 18 residues close to the C-terminus of the secretin, and that the residues, unstructured binding to pilotin, are helical binding.

However, most of the modeling work on biological systems still focuses on chemical systems.

We performed single cell measurements to test the predictions of this model regarding the spontaneous cell polarization of two types of cancer cells with different cell membrane tensions. Membrane tension modulated the spatiotemporal properties of polarity and adjusted the cells’ sensitivity to external stimuli. Furthermore, our model recapitulates the experimental results described by Houk et al., indicating that an increase (decrease) in tension results in a decrease (recovery) of Rac-GTP activity and that the relaxation of tension induces new polarity of the cell body when a cell with the pseudopod-neck-body morphology is severed.

We test predictions of this model by performing single cell measurements of spontaneous polarization in cancer stem cells (CSCs) and non-stem cancer cells (NSCCs) using lower cell membrane and lower cell tension. Based on our experimental results, cell polarization is sensitive to stimuli with low membrane tension, and high membrane tension improves robustness and stability. Furthermore, our simulations recapitulate experimental results described by Houk et al. and show that aspiration (increase tension) and release (reduction tension) result in a decrease in the recovery activity of Rac-GTPase and a new polarity in cell body cell.

In fact, a careful balance between excitation and inhibition is required for the brain to operate in a sustained state, away from both epileptic activity (which would arise if excitation dominated over inhibition) and complete quiescence (which would emerge if inhibition prevailed). While much work has been devoted to study how excitation and inhibition are organized at the level of neural microcircuits, little is known about how these two effects are structured at larger scales. Here we are interested in the scale of cortical macrocolumns, large collectives of neurons that can be described computationally by population models known as neural mass models. These models are routinely used to describe the brain rhythms observed with non-invasive techniques such as EEG. In this paper we show, using a neural mass model, that a collection of coupled cortical macrocolumns self-organizes spontaneously into a dynamical state in which excitation and inhibition are segregated at the mesoscopic level, with some cortical columns (the most connected ones) being inhibitory, and the rest being excitatory.","Neurons in the brain are known to operate a careful balance between excitation inhibition and inhibition, which maintains neural microcircuits in the proper operational range. However, the balance is not well understood at the mesoscopic level of neuronal populations. In order to address this issue, we use a coupled neural mass model to study the computationally dynamics of a network of cortical macrocolumns operating in a partially synchronized, irregular regime. We find that the topology of the network is heterogeneous, and nodes acting as connector hubs rest relatively poorly connected. Our results suggest that the type of mesoscopic network of excitation and inhibition spontaneously segregate, with columns acting mainly in an excitatory manner and predominantly having an inhibitory effect on neighbors. We also characterize the conditions under which segregation arises, and relate the character of different columns to their topological role in the network. In particular, connector hubs are preferentially inhibitory, but have larger node connectivity. These results suggest the potential for mesoscale organization and excitation-inhibition balance in brain networks."

In this article we studied the evolutionary history of a host-targeting effector secretion system of the mammalian pathogen Bartonella that belongs to a group of machineries descended from secretion systems originally mediating DNA transfer between bacterial cells. Intriguingly, we found that such a DNA transfer machinery closely related to the host-targeting secretion system of Bartonella has recruited a bacterial protein involved in modulating DNA topology as an interbacterial effector protein that is translocated together with the DNA into recipient cells. The overall setup of this interbacterial effector is remarkably similar to the host-targeted effectors of Bartonella, and we propose that it represents an evolutionary missing link on the path from a genuine bacterial protein to effectors that manipulates host cell functioning. Further analyses showed that interbacterial effectors in DNA transfer may be a more common phenomenon and represent an important reservoir for the evolution of new host-targeted effectors.","Host-targeting type IV secretion systems (T4SS) have evolved conjugative T4SS machineries to mediate interbacterial plasmid transfer.

Myosin cross-bridge binding is regulated by Ca2+ and the thin filament proteins troponin and tropomyosin. Cooperative interactions between actin, myosin, troponin, and tropomyosin greatly influence spatial and kinetic properties of thin filament activation, thereby affecting muscle mechanics and contractility. Such cooperative interactions are complex and individual contributions from the different contractile and regulatory proteins are difficult to separate experimentally. However, a few theoretical models have explored interactions between the spatial, kinetic, and mechanical processes that affect cooperative cross-bridge binding to actin. Building on our prior spatially-explicit computational models, we investigated the relative contributions of thin filament regulatory proteins and cross-bridges to cooperatively amplify skeletal muscle force production. We find that Ca2+-dependent contraction in skeletal muscle is dominated by neighboring regulatory protein interactions along the thin filament, while cross-bridge binding is critical for maintaining or stabilizing thin filament activation as force develops. Moreover, we reveal that variations in filament and cross-bridge stiffness can alter Ca2+-sensitivity and cooperativity of skeletal muscle force production. In conclusion, these simulations show that multiple cooperative mechanisms combine to produce physiological force responses measured from muscle cells.","Striated muscle contraction is a highly cooperative process initiated by the Ca2+ binding of the troponin complex, which leads to myosin cross-bridge (XB) formation and formation of thin filaments. Experimental computational studies suggest that skeletal muscle fiber activation is greatly augmented by cooperative interactions with neighboring thin filament regulatory units (RU-RU cooperativity; 1 RU   =  7 actin monomers+1 troponins complex+1tropomyosin molecule) and that XB binding can amplify thin filament activation interactions between RUs and RUs. These interactions occur in a temporal order, considered kinetic forms of cooperativity. Previous spatially-imaginative models have illustrated that mechanical forms cooperativity exist, arising from XB-induced XBbinding and RU-XB cooperativity, but the relative contribution mechanisms are difficult to separate experimentally and experimentally. Here, we investigate the contributions of a multi-filar model of skeletal muscle contraction in a model of half sarcomere, allowing us to predict the force-Ca2+ relationship between filament XB compliance and the RUs XB. Our results suggest that kinetic form cooperativity may rapidly dominate early activation, and that mechanical form cooperative may act slowly, augmenting XB/RU binding force as the force continues to develop."

One can expect to gain power for detecting such variants by including relevant covariates in the analysis, by accounting for any relatedness of sampled individuals, and by making use of partial information in the data. For analysis of continuously-varying traits, variations on linear mixed-model (LMM) approaches have proven effective at achieving some of these goals. However, for case-control or binary trait mapping, there remain significant challenges. Direct application of LMM approaches to binary traits suffers from power loss when covariate effects are strong, and existing generalized LMM approaches can perform poorly in the presence of trait model misspecification and partially missing data. We propose CERAMIC, a method for binary trait mapping, which is computationally feasible for large genome-wide studies, and which gains power over previous approaches by improved trait modeling, retrospective assessment of significance, accounting for sample structure, and making use of partially missing data. We illustrate this approach in genome-wide association mapping of type 2 diabetes in data from the Framingham Heart Study.","In this study, we propose a method to estimate the number of genetic associations in a binary trait sample that contains related individuals, and adjust relevant covariates to allow for missing data. We propose CERAMIC, an estimating equation approach that is viewed as a hybrid logistic regression and linear mixed-effects model (LMM) approach. In this work, we extend the recently proposed CARAT method to allow samples of related individuals to incorporate partially missing data, while maintaining high power and correct type 1 error in a wider range of scenarios. CERAMPIC results in a particularly large power increase over existing methods. When the sample includes related individuals missing data (e.g., individuals phenotype covariate information and missing genotype), CERamIC is able to use relationship information to incorporate partial missing data analysis and correcting dependence. We also demonstrate that CerAMIC can be used for retrospective analysis and robust misspecification of the phenotype model, resulting in a better control of type 1 errors and higher power than prospective methods, GMMAT, and phenotype model misspecified. Our results demonstrate that the method can be computationally efficient in genomewide analysis of samples from related individuals configuration, including small families, unrelated individuals and large, complex pedigrees."

However, in the past several years, research has revealed the existence of an additional line of host defense against HIV/SIV. It is now apparent that cells contain factors (also known as cellular restrictions) that potently inhibit virus infection. This has forced primate lentiviruses to evolve a strategy to counteract these cellular restriction factors. For example, HIV/SIV encode an accessory protein called Vif, whose function is to neutralize a cellular restriction to HIV/SIV infection. Our study provides evidence for a novel restriction that is expressed by macrophages and which potently antagonizes HIV and SIV infection. We describe how the virus protects itself from this cellular restriction. The goal is to harness this cellular restriction as the basis for a novel therapeutic strategy against HIV infection.","Primate lentiviruses encode “ accessory proteins” including Vif, Vpu, Nef, and Vpr/Vpx. Vif and Vpu counteract antiviral effects of cellular restrictions in the early late steps of the viral replication cycle. Here, we present evidence that Vpx and HIV-2/SIVSM promote virus infection by antagonizing antiviral restriction in macrophages. Vpx is essential for virus infection, whereas HIV-1 and SIVSM are dispensable for viral infection. We generated heterokaryons that supported infection with wild-type SIV and Vpx-deleted SIV. The restriction of Vpx was potently antagonized by infection with macrophage infected with infected SIV, but the expression of the Vpx ubiquitylated ubiquitylation proteasome was regulated by Vpx. Our results indicate that the ability of the virus to counteract the restriction of HIV/1 or SIV infection is dependent on the HIV-3 Vpx interacting protein, damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), and DDB1 partially substituted for Vpx fused with Vpr. These results suggest that the virus can harbor a potent antiviral effect in primate and lentivirus strains."

Parthenogenesis represents a specific mode of asexual reproduction, secondarily derived from sexual reproduction, and refers to the development of a multicellular organism from an unfertilised gamete. Parthenogenesis has evolved independently in a wide variety of groups, but the genetic basis and the evolutionary forces driving transitions from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction remain elusive. Here, we explore genetic, genomic and transcriptomic data from the brown alga Ectocarpus to uncover the genetic architecture of parthenogenesis. The brown algae are a group of complex multicellular organisms that have been evolving independently from animals and plants for more than a billion years, and they have recently emerged as important models to study the evolution of reproductive modes. We show that parthenogenesis is a complex genetic trait under the control of the sex locus, together with two additional autosomal quantitative trait loci, highlighting the critical role for the sex chromosomes in the control of asexual reproduction in this organism. We identify several negative effects of parthenogenesis on male fitness and reveal evidence for trade-offs between sexual and asexual reproduction during the life cycle of Ectocarpus. Our results support the idea that parthenogenesis may be under both sex-specific selection and generation/ploidally-antagonistic selection, but the action of fluctuating selection on this trait may also contribute to the maintenance of polymorphisms in populations.","Sexual reproduction is the most frequent form of asexual reproduction in eukaryotes, but the genetic bases of these shifts remain largely elusive. Here, we use quantitative trait analysis, combined with genomic transcriptomic information, to dissect the genetic basis of both asexual and parthenogenetic reproduction in brown alga Ectocarpus. We found that parthenogenesis is controlled by a sex locus, additional autosomal loci, highlighting a key role for the sex chromosome as a major regulator of sexual reproduction. We identify negative and positive effects of sex on male fitness, and different fitness effects on parthenogenic capacity depending on the life cycle generation. We discuss the possibility that sex-specific selection, ploidally- antagonistic selection, and/or action of a fluctuating selection trait may contribute to maintenance of polymorphisms in populations. Importantly, our data provide empirical illustration, knowledge, and trade-offs between the two haploid and diploid stages of life cycle, which may help maintain genetic variation.

We also developed a mouse model with this mutation, and showed that the model mouse exhibits abnormal social behavior. These results suggest that a rare variant in NLGN1 is functionally significant and support that the NLGN synaptic pathway may be important in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Neuroligin3 (NLGN3), a cell adhesion molecule in the neuronal synapse, is the most common risk gene for ASD, and additional variants of NLGN3 and NLGN4 have been found in ASD patients. However, synaptopathies are not known to cause neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. In humans, NLGNs consist of family members, and neuroligin1 is a major component of forming a complex of excitatory and glutamatergic synapses.

Using results from a face-to-face questionnaire, our study compared characteristics from Cameroonian patients with Buruli ulcer to people without Buruli ulcer. This latter group of people was chosen within the community or within the family of case patients. The statistical analysis confirmed some well-known factors associated with the presence of BU, such as wearing short lower-body clothing while farming, but it showed that the use of bed nets and the treatment of wounds with leaves is less frequent in case patients.

As a result of ineffective initial control efforts, an Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scale emerged. As of 4 2015, 19,000 confirmed Ebola cases were reported in West Africa, mainly in Guinea (3,529), Liberia (5,343), and Sierra Leone (10,746). We present analyses of data collected during the outbreak identifying the drivers of transmission and highlighting areas where control has improved. We found that the proportion of cases reporting funeral exposure decreased over time. We also found a positive correlation (r = 0.35, p < 0.001) with the proportion given to a district given month-district transmission intensity, quantified by the estimated reproduction number (R). We found a negative correlation between funeral exposure and the R district proportion of hospitalised cases admitted ≤4 days after symptom onset. These proportions were correlated, suggesting that reduced funeral attendance and faster hospitalisation independently influenced local transmission intensity. We were able to identify 14% of potential source contacts of cases in the case line-list. Linking cases with contacts potentially infected provided information about the transmission network. This revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in inferred transmissions, with 20% of cases accounting for 73% of new infections, a phenomenon called super-spread. Multivariable regression models allowed us to identify predictors named by potential source contact."

Here, we characterized the interactions between Ebola, Sudan Marburg virus and VP30 in vitro biochemistry, structural biology, and cell-based mini-replicon assays. We found that the VP30 C-terminal domain interacts with a short peptide C of terminal region of the NP. Our crystal structures reveal that the conserved, proline-rich NP peptide binds to a shallow hydrophobic cleft of the VP20 C- terminal domain.

Releases of genetically sterile males have been shown to reduce wild mosquito numbers. An alternative approach is to release mosquitoes carrying genes blocking dengue transmission. It is often assumed that spreading such genes in mosquito populations requires using selfish genetic elements (SGEs - genes that are inherited at higher rates than other genes in the genome). Absent such techniques, the release numbers required to transform mosquito populations is seen as prohibitive. However, strategies that rely on SGEs or related technologies to spread anti-dengue genes are unlikely to be implemented in the near future as a public health response. Using a biologically detailed model of Aedes aegypti populations dynamics and genetics, we assess how many mosquitoes need to be released to spread an anti-pathogen gene in an urban environment without using an SGE. We compare release numbers with two other, currently feasible transgenic strategies: releasing mosquitoes with female-lethal genes, and mosquitoes carrying both female-lethal and anti-pathogen genes. We show that even without using SGEs, releasing mosquitoes in numbers much smaller than those considered necessary for transgenic population reduction can effectively reduce the ability of Aedes aegypti to spread dengue.","Introgression of anti-pathogen constructs in wild vector populations can reduce disease transmission. However, it is generally assumed that introgression will require linking the anti-Pathogen gene with a selfish genetic element similar to similar technologies. In this study, we use a stochastic, spatially explicit model of Aedes aegypti to investigate the performance of releasing mosquitoes carrying an anti-tuberculosis construct in an efficient and effective tropical city in Iquitos, Peru. We assess the performance and performance of releases of realistic release numbers, compare transient long-term effects of strategy genetic control strategies, and compare transient effects of the strategies developed by the two strategies. We find that releasing mosquitoes with a strain of female-specific lethality, strain female-type lethality and anti-thermal lethality are more likely to result in a comparatively rapid robust population replacement than those that rely on population reduction. This is a light non-intuitive result, and directing efforts to improve rearing capacity and logistical support for implementing releases, reducing fitness costs and existing recombinant technologies, may provide a viable, alternative route for introgressing anti-transgenes in field conditions."

How metabolic organs and organelles adapt to nutritional fluctuations, or fail to do so, remains incompletely understood. To explore these issues, we developed a new platform to explore translational responses in the liver, a critical organ for metabolic homeostasis. In this translatomic platform, we integrated polysome profiling and global analysis of polysome-associated mRNAs to systematically quantify protein synthesis on each transcript in obesity and during fasting. Our analysis demonstrated for the first time that protein synthesis is progressively suppressed in the obese liver and that the overall translatome profile of obese liver markedly resembles that of fasting lean mice, particularly in mitochondrial function and bile metabolism. We also examined the physiological impact of some of these alterations and concluded that aberrant bile acid metabolism in the obese liver represents a novel mechanism contributing to hyperglycemia and continuous weight gain. Together, our work reveals abnormal translational regulation as a novel aspect of obesity that could impact future directions in metabolic disease treatment, and we believe translatome profiling represents a new approach to unravel complex mechanisms regulating cellular function and disease pathology.","Obesity-associated metabolic complications are generally considered to emerge from abnormalities in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, but the status of protein metabolism has not been studied. Here, we performed comparative polysome and associated transcriptional profiling analyses to study the dynamics and functional implications of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–associated protein synthesis in mouse liver conditions of obesity and nutrient deprivation. We discovered that ER livers of obese mice exhibits a general reduction in protein synthesis, and extensive-regulation of protein synthesis machinery, mitochondrial components, bile acid metabolism, and the obese translatome. Nutrient availability plays an important distinct role in remodeling the hepatic ER translatom in lean and obese mice. Fasting obese mice partially reversed overall translatomic differences between lean and nonfasted controls, and fasting lean mice mimicked translatomic changes induced by development of obesity. The strongest examples of these regulations were the reduction of Cyp7b1 and Slco1a1, molecules involved in bile acids metabolism. Exogenous expression of the gene significantly lowered plasma glucose levels, improved hepatic steatosis, and caused cholestasis, indicating a fine balance between bile and fatty acids in regulating metabolism and health. Our work defines a dynamic regulation of liver translatomic metabolism and metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity."

The selected location is often determined by the bottom-up visual inputs rather than the top-down intentions. For example, a red dot among green ones automatically attracts attention and is said to be salient. Physiological data have suggested that the primary visual cortex (V1) in the brain contributes to creating such bottom-up saliencies from visual inputs, but indicated little on whether V1 plays an essential or peripheral role in creating a saliency map of the input space to guide attention. Traditional psychological frameworks, based mainly on behavioral data, have implicated higher-level brain areas for the saliency map. Recently, it has been hypothesized that V1 creates this saliency map, such that the image location whose visual input evokes the highest response among all V1 output neurons is most likely selected from a visual scene for attentional processing. This paper derives nontrivial predictions from this hypothesis and presents their psychophysical tests and confirmations. Our findings suggest that bottom-up saliency is computed at a lower brain area than previously expected, and have implications on top-down attentional mechanisms.","The primary visual cortex (V1) plays a central role in input-driven-saliency. However, little is known about how V1 mechanisms explain the high saliency of pop-basic features, such as the unique conjunction feature of red vertical bar and red horizontal green vertical bars. In this paper, we report nontrivial predictions of the V1 saliency hypothesis, based on psychophysical tests and confirmations. Our prediction clearly distinguishes V1 from other models that rely on task-relevant features to interfere with visual search segmentation tasks. For instance, irrelevant colors interfere with the orientation-based task, presence of horizontal vertical bars impair the performance of the task based on oblique bars. Furthermore, the properties of intracortical interactions between neural selectivities and V1 predict specific emergent phenomena associated with visual grouping. Our findings support the idea that V1 may map the lower visual area traditionally expected, implications-selection mechanisms."

If only one of the DSB ends shares homology with another region, repair proceeds via break-induced replication (BIR), which, unlike GC, can lead to nonreciprocal translocations. We previously showed that a Recombination Execution Checkpoint (REC) delays BIR thereby preventing it from acting on breaks that can be repaired by GC. Here, we induced two DSBs such that only one end from each break shares homology with an ectopic donor so that although repair can proceed via GC, it will result in DNA rearrangement. We asked whether REC would inhibit GC-mediated repair in this scenario. We found that REC does not restrict such repair; however, repair by GC is faster when both ends are derived from a single DSB. We suggest that the DSB ends engage in a coordinated search for homology that favors both ends engaging the same donor, thus avoiding complex chromosomal rearrangements. Moreover, when the two ends of a DSB share homology with different loci, recombination of one end with its partner impedes repair of the other end.","Correct repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is critical for maintaining genome stability. DSBs are normally repaired by repair of error-free, repair break-induced replication (BIR), which is associated with non- reciprocal translocations and loss of heterozygosity. We have previously shown that the Recombination Execution Checkpoint (REC) mediates competition by preventing the BIR pathway from acting on DSB ends that are repaired by the GC. However, we found that when ends are engaged in a GC-compatible configuration, repair involving ends from different breaks can produce potentially deleterious translocations. In this study, we show that the kinetics of repair are markedly delayed when ends that participate in the GC belong to different DSB (called Trans) compared to the case where DSB end does not come from a break (Cis). Furthermore, when repair of Trans occurs after GC BIR, the overall efficiency of repair is comparable to that of repair of Cis. Finally, we find that the delay in repair appears to reflect tethering sequences that recombine at genomic locations that share sequence homology. These data support previous observations that ends of a DSB usually are tethered to tethering and that tethering facilitates ends encountering a donor sequence."

Among these studies, the potential protective effect of some helminth species on malaria severity has attracted considerable attention because of the possible public health impact. However, despite the fact that helminth species frequently co-occur together within an individual, no studies have investigated the role of within-host helminth community interactions on malaria severity. Taking the advantage of a cohort study in Thailand, we found that infection by Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura were both associated with direct reductions in cerebral malaria risk. However, the benefit of T. trichiura infection was halved in the presence of hookworm, revealing that interactions among helminth species can jeopardize the beneficial role of individual helminths. Our study shows that the outcome of interactions between two parasite species can be significantly modified by a third, emphasizing the critical role that parasite community interactions play in shaping infection outcomes and their impact on public health. These insights are especially relevant for neglected tropical diseases that occur in areas of high pathogen diversity.","The role of parasite community interactions in the development of malaria is poorly understood.

We found that infection with Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura was associated with direct reductions in the risk of developing cerebral malaria.

This low diversity could result from neutral processes, for example, if there are fewer males successfully mating (and thus fewer Y chromosomes being inherited) relative to the number of females who successfully mate. Alternatively, natural selection may act on mutations on the Y chromosome to reduce genetic diversity. Because there is no recombination across most of the Y chromosome all sites on the Y are effectively linked together. Thus, selection acting on any one site will affect all sites on the Y indirectly. Here, studying the X, Y, autosomal and mitochondrial DNA, in combination with population genetic simulations, we show that low observed Y chromosome variability is consistent with models of purifying selection removing deleterious mutations and linked variation, although positive selection may also be acting. We further infer that the number of sites affected by selection likely includes some proportion of the highly repetitive ampliconic regions on the Y. Because the functional significance of the ampliconic regions is poorly understood, our findings should motivate future research in this area.","The human Y chromosome exhibits surprisingly low levels of genetic diversity. This may be due to neutral processes that are effective in reducing the number of offspring of males and females.

These antibodies target a variety of sites on the envelope protein of HIV, three copies of which associate to form a trimer that decorate the membrane surface of the virus particle. Some of these antibodies target regions of the envelope protein close to the membrane, some bind to the top of the trimer, others bind via carbohydrates which cover the envelope protein and another subset binds to the same site as the human HIV receptor CD4. Despite effectively blocking 50% of infection at low antibody concentrations, for some particular virus/antibody combinations a proportion of virus particles are resistant to antibody neutralization, even at extremely high concentrations. This phenomenon is called incomplete neutralization and also frequently results in non-sigmoidal dose-response curves when antibody concentration is plotted against the level of virus infection. Previously, antibodies that target the apex of the trimer have been associated with incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal curves. In this study we show that representatives from all the groups of antibodies described above result in incomplete neutralization against at least one virus but that the phenomenon is more frequent for those binding the apex and the stalk of the trimer. Resistant populations of virus were seen whether the virus was produced in the natural target of HIV infection (human CD4+ T cells) or engineered human cells more commonly used to produce virus to test antibody function. Understanding this phenomenon is important for the future use of antibodies as therapeutics and for vaccine studies as a resistant population of viruses could result in failure to control the virus infection in patients.","HIV monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) and PG9, PG16, PGT151, and PGT152 have been shown to occasionally display an unusual virus neutralization profile with a non-sigmoidal slope plateauing at <100% of neutralization.

We used a panel of pseudoviruses from the CD4 T-cell (U87.CCR5.CXCR4) assay panel and 117 viruses from the TZM-bl assay, and found that bnMAb targeting neutralizing epitopes and spike neutralization profiles of the virus plateaued at <90%. Furthermore, we found that the bnMbs targeting the V2 apex of Env gp41 and gp41 were more likely to display neutralization curves that plateaued <90% than those seen in other types of virus production consistent with the patterns observed in the current study.

These parasites typically have complex life cycles involving multiple hosts and some, like Toxoplasma gondii, have the ability to remain in the host for life as a latent tissue cyst. Toxoplasma is one of the most successful parasites on Earth because the ability to develop into a tissue cyst greatly facilitates transmission through carnivores. Cyst formation also is responsible for recrudescent infection in immunocompromised patients. The conversion of Toxoplasma from its replicating cell to the cyst is triggered by stress, but we have little understanding of how the parasite stress response functions. In this study, we identify the genes involved in Toxoplasma's response to alkaline stress, which is a known trigger of cyst development. We also establish that a lysine acetyltransferase enzyme called TgGCN5-A is required for type I RH strain Toxoplasma to respond normally to alkaline stress. Parasites lacking TgGCN5-A are no longer capable of activating genes induced during cyst formation triggered by alkaline pH.","Parasitic protozoa apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii progress through the life cycle in response to stimuli in the environment of the host organism. However, little is known about how these cells reprogram their genome response to stress. We have previously linked histone acetylation and expression of stage-specific genes to stress-induced changes in gene expression. We sought to determine whether GCN5, which operates as a transcriptional co-activator by virtue of its histone and acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, contributed to the stress-related changes in the gene expression of the parasite. In contrast to lower eukaryotes, which have duplicated its HAT activity, the parasite duplicated the GCNN5 lysine acetyl transferase (KAT). Disruption of the gene encoding the TgGCN5-type RH strain produced a severe phenotype in normal culture conditions, while TgGGCNN1-null mutant deficient in responding to alkaline pH, a common stress, did not induce bradyzoite differentiation in vitro. We performed a genome-wide analysis of the expression of stress-deficient genes and found that the parasites deleted TgC5-fail-to-regulate 74% of stress response genes and induced a 2-fold increase in wild-type genes. Our results indicate that Tgc5 is a major contributor to the alkaline stress response in RH strain of Txoplasma."

They are able to autonomously change position and proliferate in chromosomes. The nature of the coevolutionary dynamics of IS with the genome that hosts them is a matter of debate: Do IS proliferate to the point of causing the extinction of the host? Is it possible that IS and hosts stably coexist? Can environmental perturbations cause IS expansions? What is the role of selection in controlling IS copy number? In this study, we have analysed abundance patterns of IS families to test two different evolutionary hypotheses: in the first one IS evolve neutrally, while in the second case they are affected by selection. Our results indicate that, most of the time, IS and their hosts coexist stably in a neutral scenario where the proliferation of IS through duplications and lateral gene transfer is balanced by regular deletions. Occasionally, though, this balance may be disrupted, causing temporary explosions of IS abundance.","Insertion sequences are the simplest and most abundant form of transposable DNA found in bacterial genomes. They present multiple copies, thought to promote genomic plasticity and genetic exchange, a major force of evolutionary change. The main processes that determine the content of genomes, however, are still a matter of debate. In this work, we use large genomic data to estimate the abundance distributions of 33 families of 1811 bacterial chromosomes. We use simple models of dynamics to estimate key parameters. We find that the observed abundances are compatible with a neutral scenario where proliferation is controlled by deletions instead of purifying selection. In cases driven by selection, neutral behavior dominates large evolutionary scales. Our approach allows detection of recent expansions, supports the hypothesis that rapid expansions constitute transient events — punctuations—that occur when the state of coexistence is perturbated."

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bacterial toxin that alters host innate immune defense by hijacking host proteins involved in the ubiquitin proteolytic system. P. aeruginosa is recognized as the most common bacterial pathogen in ventilator-associated pneumonia and is commonly isolated from community-acquired pneumonia patients. While P. aeruginosa can cause devastating acute infections, many studies have documented that P. aeruginosa can also generate chronic infections in immunocompromised individuals, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis patients. In these patients, the ineffective host immune response to the bacterial colonization is thought to play a large role in deteriorating lung function and ultimately the death of the patient. Our findings have significant implications to the study of P. aeruginosa infections in the lung, particularly the ability of P. aeruginosa to disrupt critical host innate immune response mechanisms.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is chronically infecting the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, cystic fibrosis (CF), and bronchiectasis. Cif (PA2934), a bacterial toxin secreted from outer membrane vesicles (OMV) of P. aerugino, reduces CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in human airway epithelial cells, a key driving force for mucociliary clearance. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which Cif inhibits CFTR and chloride secretion. We found that Cif redirected endocytosed CFTR recycling from endosomes to lysosomes by stabilizing the inhibitory effect of G3BP1 deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and increasing the degradation of CFTR lysoomes. We also found that the bacterial toxin regulates the activity of the host DUB. These data suggest that the ability to infect patients with COPD, pneumonia, and CF, and that the secretion of OMV containing Cif, reduces the clearance of pathogens."

This suggests that many protein interaction surfaces may not be intrinsically “druggable” by small molecules, and elevates in importance the few successful examples as model systems for improving our understanding of factors contributing to druggability. Here we describe a new approach for exploring protein fluctuations leading to surface pockets suitable for small molecule binding. We find that the presence of such pockets is indeed a signature of druggable protein interaction sites, suggesting that “druggability” is a property encoded on a protein surface through its propensity to form pockets.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) plays a central role in such communication and proceeds with a series of multiprotein assembly, deformation of the plasma membrane, and production of a membrane vesicle that delivers extracellular signaling molecules into the cytoplasm. In this study, we utilized our home-built correlative imaging system comprising high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) and confocal fluorescence microscopy to simultaneously image morphological changes of the plasma membrane and protein localization during CME in a living cell. The results revealed a tight correlation between the size of the pit and the amount of clathrin assembled. Actin dynamics play multiple roles in the assembly, maturation, and closing phases of the process, and affects membrane morphology, suggesting a close relationship between endocytosis and dynamic events at the cell cortex. Knock down of dynamin also affected the closing motion of the pit and showed functional correlation with actin.","Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) proceeds through a series of morphological changes in the plasma membrane that are induced by a number of protein components. The spatiotemporal assembly of proteins has been elucidated using fluorescence-based techniques, but the protein-induced morphological change in plasma membrane is not fully clarified in living cells. Here, we visualize the membrane morphology and protein localizations during CME utilizing high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) combined with confocal laser scanning unit. We show that the membrane starts to invaginate approximately 30 s after clathrin starts to assemble, aperture diameter increases, and clathr accumulates. Actin rapidly accumulates in the pit, which induces small membrane swelling, and, after 30 s, rapidly covers the pit irreversibly. Inhibition of actin turnover abolishes swelling and induces a reversible open–close motion pit, indicating that actin dynamics is necessary for efficient irreversible pit closure at the end of CME."

In this study, we used a rice diversity panel for genome wide association mapping to identify HKT1;1 as a factor regulating Na+ distribution. Within the rice diversity panel we observed higher Na+ levels in root tissue in the indica subpopulation compared to japonica accessions. Three non-synonymous variants were identified within HKT1;1 that were associated with altered Na+ accumulation in root tissue, and displayed contrasting frequencies between indica and japonica subspecies. The introduction of HKT1;1 from an indica accession that contained the three non-synonymous variants into a japonica background resulted in a phenotype similar to that exhibited by the indica subpopulation. This work suggests that these allelic variants are likely responsible for the higher root Na+ observed in indica accessions. This study has identified a genetic resource for modifying Na+ content rice, and provides evidence that HKT1;1 underlies the divergence between indica and japonica subspecies in root Na+ content.","Salinity is a major factor limiting crop productivity. Rice (Oryza sativa) is a staple crop in the majority of the world, highly sensitive to salinity stress. To discover novel sources of genetic variation in salt tolerance-related traits in rice, we screened 390 diverse accessions to 14 days of moderate (9 dS·m-1) salinity. We found a significant difference in root Na+ and Na+ content observed in major subpopulations of rice, indica accessions displaying higher root Na+, and japonica accessions exhibiting lower root Na+. The genetic basis of these variation phenotypes was elucidated by a genome-wide association (GWA). The strongest associations were identified in a region spanning ~575 Kb on chromosome 4, named Root Na+ Content 4 (RNC4). Two Na+ transporters, HKT1;1 and HKT2;4, were identified as candidates for RNC4. Reduced expression of HKT3;1 or HKT4 in the CDS indica variety in the Japonica background resulted in a phenotype similar to that observed in the indica subpopulation, but with a higher level of shoot than the Na+:K+ subpopulation. Our study provides evidence that HKTα;1 regulates the root Na− content, underlies the divergence between root Na and K+ content in the major subspecies of rice."

One possibility is that the oscillations are part of a stimulus-encoding mechanism. Here, we investigate a computational model of such a mechanism, a spiking neuronal network whose intrinsic oscillations interact with external input (waveforms simulating short speech segments in a single acoustic frequency band) to encode stimuli that extend over a time interval longer than the oscillation's period. The network implements a temporally sparse encoding, whose robustness to time warping and neuronal noise we quantify. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that a biophysically plausible model of oscillations occurring in the processing of auditory input may generate a representation of signals that span multiple oscillation cycles.","Sensory processing is associated with gamma frequency oscillations (30–80 Hz) in sensory cortices. However, it is unclear whether gamma oscillations are directly involved in the representation of time-changing stimuli, including stimuli on a time scale with a longer gamma cycle. We address this issue by using a dynamical model of spiking neurons to study the response to asymmetric sawtooth input with a current range of shape parameters. The parameters describe fast input current rises and falls over time. We find that oscillations in the gamma range are sufficient to generate oscillations of period-to-stimulus duration. We also find that excitatory cells fire a single spike of a stimulus, depending on the tuning properties of the temporal structure of the specific input; identity of the stimulus coded by the list of excitator cells in the fire cycle makes a robust uniform warping time scale."

Infections by hookworms and roundworms for example cause anemia, widespread developmental problems and devalued immunity against bacterial infections such as salmonella and tuberculosis. Although treatable with drugs, parasitic nematode re-infections occur as humans do not develop protective immunity. Ultimately, the public health burden caused by these infections will be best controlled by the development of vaccines against nematode infections. For these to be effective, it is important to understand how the various components of the immune system can respond to infection. In this study, we show that B cells, which typically protect against infection by producing antibodies, can also protect against an experimental hookworm like nematode infection by additional mechanisms. This form of protection instead depended on B cells producing cytokines associated with parasitic nematode expulsion and also by providing T cells with specific instruction. Together, these B cell driven responses lead to a rapid resolution of the infection. These important findings indicate that vaccination strategies against nematode parasites such as hookworms need to understand immune responses other than antibody to be optimally protective.","Infection with N. brasiliensis is a major public health problem in Latin America and the Caribbean. In this study, we investigated the role of B cell function in protective TH2 immunity against infection with this pathogen. We found that B cell-specific IL-4Rα and IL-13 were required for protection against primary infection. We also found that the presence of B cells in the bloodstream of infected mice resulted in increased worm burdens compared to control mice, despite the equivalent capacity of the B cells to control secondary infection. Impaired protection correlated with reduced lymphocyte IL-12 production and decreased MHC class II CD86 surface expression. Adoptive transfer of antigen from the infected B cells into the naïve BALB/c mice, which were deficient in IL-8 and IL4Rβ deficient in B cells, conferred protection against secondary infection with N., suggesting that B cells are important for co-ordination of immunity. Our data suggest that TLR dependent antigen processing by IL-α-responsive B cells producing IL-14 may contribute to significantly to CD4+ T cell-mediated protective immunity against N., and suggest that CD4 + T cell mediated protective immunity may also be important for B cells."

So far there are no effective treatments available. This study evaluates the protective efficacy of 8 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, in mice and guinea pigs. Various combinations and doses of the neutralizing and non-neutralizing MAbs were tested, and a post-exposure treatment protocol was determined. There was 100% survival when guinea pigs received a mix of 3 neutralizing MAbs two days after a challenge with 1,000 LD50 of guinea pig-adapted EBOV. This data suggests that the MAbs generated are effective as a post-exposure therapeutic for a lethal Ebola virus infection. Development of a post-exposure therapeutic for an Ebola virus infection is vital due to the high lethality of the disease, the relative speed in which it kills, and the fact that no vaccine has been approved for human use. Additionally, is it unlikely that preventative vaccines will be employed, because Ebola virus infections occur primarily in Africa, and to date have only killed approximately 2,300 people making it financially unfeasible for a mass vaccination. Therefore, having an effective therapy in the event of an outbreak would be extremely beneficial.","Ebola virus (EBOV) causes acute hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates, and mortality rates are 90%.

We were able to test the protection of 8 MAbs i.p. doses individually in pools of 3–4 MAbs to test protection against a lethal challenge of mouse- and pig-adapted EBOV. Eight MAbs (100 µg) protected mice from lethal challenge administered by a 1 day challenge. Seven MAbs were effective at 2 days post-infection (dpi), with 1 MAb demonstrating partial protection at 3 dpi. The guinea pig MAb showed partial protection of 1 dpi, and mean time of death was significantly prolonged compared to the control group.

Current treatments are not optimal; however, several molecules that inhibit HCV replication are in development. However, resistance to individual antivirals is likely to develop, requiring therapy consisting of a combination of drugs targeting different stages of the viral life cycle. The entry of HCV into hepatocytes is a multistep process, involving at least four cellular receptors, leading to virion endocytosis and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Unlike the HCV replication process, these steps have not been thoroughly exploited as targets for antiviral intervention. Therefore, we screened a small molecule library for inhibitors of HCV entry and identified a compound, EI-1, that potently blocked genotype 1a and 1b HCV infection. Importantly, EI-1 also prevented direct cell-to-cell spread of HCV, a potentially significant route of transmission in infected livers. In addition, our studies suggest that EI-1 susceptibility is mediated by the viral E2 envelope glycoprotein, as resistance in E2 can overcome inhibition. The antiviral activity of EI-1 is potentiated by combinations with other HCV inhibitors, demonstrating the value of entry inhibitors in potential combination antiviral regimens.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The treatment of HCV with pegylated interferons (e.g., ribavirin) has poor response rates and significant side effects. Resistance inhibitors emerge rapidly in the clinic, suggesting that successful therapy may involve a combination of therapy with multiple inhibitors with different targets. The entry process in HCV hepatocytes represents a series of potential targets for therapeutic intervention, involving viral structural proteins that have been extensively explored in experimental limitations. Here, we show that HCV entry inhibitors, using HCV pseudoparticles (HCVspp), are effective against E1-E2 envelope proteins in genotype 1b and 1b clinical isolates. We also show that EI-1 is equally active in cell-culture adapted HCV ( HCVcc), blocking cell-free entry and cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. We demonstrate that HCVscc high-level resistance to EI–1 is selected by sequential passage in the presence of inhibitor, and resistance is also conferred by changes in the residue 719 carboxy-terminal transmembrane anchor region of E2, implicating envelope protein E I-1 susceptibility. These results suggest that inhibitors for HCV enter can be added to replication inhibitors and interferon development."

Here, we performed a 1 M SNP genome-wide association study using a large cohort of Chinese study participants at risk for NPC. Although several putative gene regions show significant associations, the strongest statistical signals involved scores of variants within the HLA region on chromosome 6. HLA poses a formidable association-genetics challenge because of extensive linkage disequilibrium, rather low allele frequencies, and multiple physically close interacting genes of diverse function. We examined over 250 NPC-HLA associated variants detected with sequence-based nucleotide alleles and amino acid variants. The multiple associations were collapsed to implicate causal signals by multivariate logistical regression to resolve allele association interaction. One operative variant was identified as the HLA-A*11:01 allele motif, specifically in the peptide binding groove, which recognizes invading antigens; a second involved two aa sites with HLA-B tracking B*13:01 and B*55:02 alleles.

Accurate real-time forecasts of whether or not initial reports will be followed by a major outbreak are necessary for efficient deployment of control. For all infectious diseases, there is a delay between infection and the appearance of symptoms, i.e. an initial period following first infection during which infected individuals remain presymptomatic. We use mathematical modeling to evaluate the effect of presymptomatic infection on predictions of major epidemics. Our results show rigorously, for the first time, that precise estimates of the current number of infected individuals—and consequently the chance of a major outbreak in future—cannot be inferred from data on symptomatic cases alone. This is the case even if the values of epidemiological parameters, such as the average infection and death or recovery rates of individuals in the population, can be estimated accurately. Accurate prediction is in fact impossible without additional data from which the number of currently infected but as yet presymptomatic individuals can be deduced.","A major outbreak (i.e. epidemic infects a large number of individuals) is predicted reliably as soon as initial cases of disease appeared in the population. However, there is significant time and effort spent on recording symptomatic cases and to estimate disease transmission parameters from these data.

Accurate prediction of an epidemic to occur requires records of symptomatic individual and supplemented with data concerning true infection status of apparently uninfected individuals. To forecast the likely future behavior of the earliest stages of an emerging outbreak, it is vital to develop accurate diagnostic tests that determine asymptomatic individuals are actually unininfected, instead of infected with detectable symptoms."

On the other hand, many of these systems function in the presence of large amounts of noise or disturbances, making one wonder how meaningful behavior can arise in these highly perturbed conditions. In this paper we show mathematically, in a general context, that synchronization is actually a means to protect interconnected systems from effects of noise and disturbances. One possible mechanism for synchronization is that the systems jointly create and then share a common signal, such as a mean electrical field or a global chemical concentration, which in turn makes each system directly connected to all others. Conversely, extracting meaningful information from average measurements over populations of cells (as commonly used for instance in electro-encephalography, or more recently in brain-machine interfaces) may require the presence of synchronization mechanisms similar to those we describe.","Synchronization is a mechanism by which distant sites of the brain communicate to cooperate, play a role in temporal binding, and attention to sensory-motor integration mechanisms. In this article, we study the role of synchronization:-called “collective enhancement of precision”. We argue that, in a nonlinear dynamical context, synchronization can help protect interconnected neurons from random perturbations that can affect their nervous system. This is precisely the main contribution of mathematical proof, specific, quantified conditions, to impact the noise of individual interconnected systems. This property allows reliable computations carried out in the presence of significant noise (e.g., retinal ganglion cells in primates) and in terms of precisely-timed interaction (temporal coding), population coding, frequency coding, and frequency coding.

In this study, we evaluated the spatio-temporal structure and phylogeography of Colombian Ae. aegypti populations from cities showing different eco-epidemiologic attributes related to dengue fever. Our results indicated that Colombian Ae. aegypti populations harbor two mitochondrial lineages related to West and East African ancestors.

Here we demonstrate that a signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family of receptors, CD244, was overexpressed on CD8+ T cells of HTLV-I-infected patients than those of healthy normal donors, and that the upregulation of the adaptor protein, SAP, in CD8+ T cells distinguished HTLV-I infected individuals with and without neurologic disease. Both CD244 and SAP were associated with effector functions (high expression of IFN-γ) of CD8+ T cells in patients with HAM/TSP. This finding has important implication for T cell-mediated pathogenesis in human chronic viral infection associated with imbalance of immune function.","HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is characterized by high frequencies of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid production of proinflammatory cytokines, which contribute to central nervous system inflammation in HTLV-infected patients. However, little is known about the differences in CD8+ T cell activation status in asymptomatic carrier (ACs) and patients with HAM /TSP. Here, we show that CD244, a signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family receptor, is significantly higher in CD4+ T cells in CD244-infecting patients, ACs in HAM/TPS, and healthy normal donors (NDs). Blockade of CD244 inhibited degranulation of IFN-γ and production of CD8 + T cells from patients in HAM and TSP, suggesting CD244 is associated with effector functions in both patients and HAM/TSSP. Furthermore, we found that the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) was overexpressed in patients and CD244 expression was associated with CD4-specific DNA loads and frequency in cells from HTLV infected patients. These findings suggest that the CD244/SAP pathway may be involved in the active regulation of the CD8-T cells in patients of HAM/PTSP, and may play roles in promoting inflammatory neurological disease."

One essential component of meiotic prophase I is the exchange of genetic information between maternal and paternal chromosomes, known as recombination or crossing over, and is mediated, at least in part, by the mismatch repair proteins MSH4–MSH5 and MLH1–MLH3. A distinct subset of crossovers in lower organisms is generated by an alternate pathway involving Mus81 endonuclease. Previous studies into the impact of Mus81 mutations in mice revealed no adverse effect on the fertility of these animals. In this study, we report subtle, yet significant, defects in meiotic progression in male and female Mus81 mice, coupled with intriguing results showing that MUS81 protein is essential for crossover control in mammals. MUS81 appears to be required for correct localization of MLH1–MLH3 complexes to paired homologous chromosomes, however, not for the maintenance of physical crossovers, visualized as chiasmata. These results show a complex interplay between the MUS81 and MLH1–MLH3 pathways for generation of crossovers and, as such, are critical to the further understanding of the intricacies of crossover control with a view to reducing meiotic error rate in humans.","Eukaryotic pathways processing double-strand breaks (DSBs) and crossovers have been described, but little is known about the role of the endonuclease Mus81. Mammalian MUS81 is implicated in the maintenance of genomic stability in somatic cells; however, little has been known about its role in meiosis. In this study, we performed a detailed examination of meiotic progression in Mus81-deficient mice and WT controls, and found significant meiotic defects in mutants. These defects include smaller testis size, depletion of mature epididymal sperm, and upregulated accumulation of MLH1 and pachytene meiocytes in an interference-independent fashion. Interestingly, chiasmata numbers in the spermatocytes of Mus81−/− animals were normal, suggesting additional integrated mechanisms controlling distinct crossover pathways. These results implicate the MUS81 pathway as a regulator of crossover frequency and placement in mammals."

This region is also a dengue hyperendemic setting. Laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection during pregnancy is challenging due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses, especially dengue. The neutralization test, which is the gold standard to discriminate between these viruses, is time-consuming, performed in few laboratories and does not define the time when the infection occurred. This study described the serological markers of ZIKV and DENV among participants (mothers and neonates) of a microcephaly case-control study conducted in Northeast Brazil (2016). Our results showed a strikingly high frequency of ZIKV exposure among mothers after the first wave of the ZIKV outbreak in this setting. Additionally, ZIKV and DENV immune status, as detected by the neutralization test, showed distinct patterns among pregnant women in this endemic area. We detected a low frequency of serological markers of recent ZIKV infection in samples collected just after delivery, highlighting the need for screening for ZIKV immune status in the early stage and throughout pregnancy to monitor congenital ZIKV syndrome.","Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is challenging cross-reactivity between dengue virus (DENV) and Zika antibody responses during pregnancy.

While insulin resistance is always present in the early phase, it is β-cell failure that determines the pace of the disease onset. Increasing evidence that the immune system is activated and plays an important role in type 2 diabetes has stimulated efforts of developing drugs targeting inflammatory cytokines. We built a model to describe the principles of type 2 diabetes onset under the influence of interleukin-1β. The disease onset is understood in terms of bifurcation. It is found that inflammatory cytokines are required to be suppressed for a limited time only, while glucose has to be controlled over the long term. These structural insights may serve as a guideline for future clinical trials.","Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes in the developing world. However, there is increasing evidence of a role for chronic inflammation in type 2 diabetes progression. In this study, we develop a model of interleukin-1β dynamics in order to explain the principles of disease onset. The parameters of the model are derived from in vitro experiments and patient data. The model suggests that treatments targeting glucose bear the potential for stopping progression of pre-diabetic and overt type 2 Diabetes. In the case of overt and overt diabetes, treatments should be complemented with adjuvant anti-inflammatory therapies in order stop decelerate disease progression. Moreover, we propose that glucose-lowering therapy needs to be continued in a similar way, and the dose duration and anti-inflammation therapy needs specifically controlled. Our model proposes a framework for discussion of clinical trial outcomes."

However, the mechanisms promoting immunopathology in patients are still unclear. We performed gene expression profiling of skin lesions from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients and normal skin and the results demonstrated that the most expressed genes in leishmanial lesions were associated with the cytolytic pathway. Using both human samples and mouse models we showed that CD8+ T cells are cytolytic within leishmanial lesions and kill Leishmania infected target cells. We found that the CD8+ T cell cytolytic response was not protective, but rather promoted increased immunopathology, associated with enhanced recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. CD8+ T cells also promoted the development of metastatic lesions at distant skin sites. Together, our results clearly demonstrate that activation of CD8+ T cell cytolytic responses is detrimental to the host and that targeting this pathway could be a new approach to treat patients with leishmaniasis.","Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the intracellular parasite Leishmania braziliensis. The pathogen is responsible for a wide range of diseases, ranging from mild to severe, including blindness. The disease progression is strongly influenced by the pathogen burden and infection-induced immunopathology. While current therapeutics focus on augmenting protective immune responses, identifying therapeutics that reduce infection- induced immunopathologies is clearly warranted. Despite the apparent protective role of murine CD8+ T cells following infection with the intracranial parasite, the presence of these cells paradoxically linked immunopathological responses to human cutaneous disease. In this study, we investigated the role of the cytolytic pathway in the progression of the disease. We found that CD8 + T cells are highly expressed in the lesions and that they are associated with the development of metastatic lesions. We also found that these cells are not directly associated with disease progression, but rather with parasite burden. These findings suggest that the presence or absence of CD8-T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease."

Common approaches to characterize proteome allocation are based on annotations of protein functions or transcriptional regulatory targets. Here, we develop a novel approach based on model-predicted proteome utilization. This approach reveals that in many environments, a large fraction of the proteome is unused. Unused protein expression is known to incur costs on organismal fitness. We show that changes in the allocation of the proteome to used versus unused fractions can account for the variability in growth rates observed across environments and is a common mechanism to increase growth rates in laboratory evolution experiments. We compare our approach to classify the proteome based on model-predicted utilization to more traditional approaches to reveal biological functions and transcriptional regulators underlying the expression of unused protein. Expression of these functions may reflect ecological trade-offs between growth, nutrient-readiness, and stress resistance.","Proteome utilization is a key determinant of cellular growth rates and fitness. However, the magnitude of variability in un-utilized protein expression in natural settings is unknown, largely due to the challenge of determining environment-specific proteome utilization.

We show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments accounting for the cost of unused protein expression explains >95% of the variance in growth rates across 16 distinct environments. Furthermore, reduction in unused protein is shown to be a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rate in adaptive evolution experiments. We also show that unused protein encodes nutrient-stress- and preparedness functions, which convey fitness benefits in varying environments. Finally, unused protein can be a source of large pervasive fitness costs that provide a benefit for hedging environmental change."

Like other complex organisms, schistosomes and other parasitic worms regulate their cell biology through extensive use of enzymes called protein kinases that phosphorylate other proteins to alter their function. One such protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), has been proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of parasitic infections and cancer. Here we use biochemical techniques to show that schistosome worms possess a functional PKA pathway that is required for survival of the parasites. We also identify a parasite gene that encodes a functional PKA enzyme and show that silencing this gene results in both significant loss of PKA activity in schistosome worms and parasite death. These findings suggest that the gene we have identified is critically important to schistosomes and that its protein product may represent a target for the development of much-needed new drugs to treat schistosome infections.","Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Schistosoma mansoni.

Acetylcholine slows the heart rate by activating the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) that, in turn, opens the acetylcholine-activated potassium channel (IK,ACh) to slow the firing of the sinus node. Surprisingly, the M2R is sensitive to membrane potential and undergoes conformational changes throughout the cardiac action potential that alter the affinity for acetylcholine, with secondary consequences for IK,ACh activity. Here, we investigated the contribution of M2R voltage sensitivity to the rate and shape of the human sinus node action potential in physiological and pathophysiological conditions, using a Markovian model of the IK,ACh channel integrated into a computational model of human sinus node. The computational model allowed us to assess the effects of potential genetic variants that alter specific properties of voltage sensitivity. Our results indicate that alterations in the M2R voltage sensitivity play a significant role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the human sinus node and atria. Our computational model is relevant for future studies aimed at the design and development of anti-arrhythmic agents that specifically target the unique voltage-sensitive properties of M2R.","Cardiac muscarinic receptor (M2R) regulates heart rate, modulating acetylcholine (ACh) by modulating the K+ current IK, ACh dissociation and G-protein, which in turn activate KACh channels. Recently, M2Rs have been noted to exhibit intrinsic voltage sensitivity, i.e. affinity for ligands varies in a voltage dependent manner. The voltage sensitivity of M2R implies that affinity for ACh (aCh effect) varies over the time course of cardiac electrical cycle. In this study, we investigated the contribution of voltage sensitivity to the shape of the human sinus node and action potentials in physiological pathophysiological conditions. We developed a Markovian model of ACh modulation and integrated it into a computational model of the heart. We performed simulations of varying ACh concentration and voltage sensitivity. We found that low ACh exerted a larger effect on the pacemaker rate than high ACh, and that ACh hyperpolarized versus depolarized membrane voltages. This led to slowing of pacemaker heart rate and attenuated the slope of phase 4 depolarization, with a marginal effect on action potential duration amplitude. These results support the hypothesis that altered M2r voltage sensitivity contributes to heart disease and provide a novel mechanistic foundation for study of clinical disorders of atrial fibrillation and inappropriate sinus tachycardia."

However, numerous experimental studies demonstrate that connexin-based channels expressed in neuronal gap junctions can change their conductance in response to a transjunctional voltage or various chemical reagents. In addition, electrical synapses may exhibit direction-dependent asymmetry of signal transfer. To account for all these phenomena, we combined a 36-state model of gap junction channel gating with Hodgkin–Huxley equations, which describes neuronal excitability. The combined model (HH-36SM) allowed us to evaluate the kinetics of junctional conductance during the spread of electrical signal or in response to chemical factors. Our modeling results, which were based on experimental data, demonstrated that electrical synapses exhibit a complex behavior that can strongly affect the response of coupled neurons. We suggest that the proposed modeling approach is also applicable to describe the behavior of cardiac or other excitable cell networks interconnected through gap junction channels.","The Hodgkin–Huxley equations describe the dynamics of electrical signal transfer between electrical synapses. Differently from previous studies, the model account for the dynamic modulation of junctional conductance and spread of the electrical signal between coupled neurons. The model is based on electrical properties of the gap junction channel encompassing fast slow gates triggered by transjunctional voltage. We quantified the influence of the difference in input resistances between electrically coupled neurons and instantaneous conductance–voltage rectification gap junctions on the asymmetry of cell-to-cell signaling. Our simulation results revealed that voltage spikes, develop neighboring cells to spread action potentials, and induce rapid decay of junctionally conductance, demonstrating spiking activity-dependent short-term plasticity of electrical synapse.

Our model allowed us to replicate the kinetics of voltage spikes in different levels of intracellular concentration free magnesium (Mg2+]i) and experimentally recorded cells expressing connnexin36, a major neuronal cell. Our modeling results demonstrate that [mg2+)i-dependent and long-term synapticity of the electric synapse can be adequately reproduced by changes in slow gate parameters in the 36-state model. Overall, our developed model accounts for direction-dependent asymmetry, short-and-long-lasting plasticity, and the electrical synaptic plasticity."

Here we describe a novel DSB response mechanism whereby ATM–dependent miR-335 downregulates CtIP. CtIP is a multifunctional protein that is crucial for DNA homologous recombination repair; and we show, for the first time, that this protein is subject to miRNA downregulation. CtIP downregulation was verified in cell lines from radiosensitive patients, and we demonstrate that this pathway contributes to radiosensitization and DNA repair defects in BRCA1 foci formation and cell cycle checkpoint. Given that miR-335 is also a tumor metastasis suppressor, our finding suggests that miR-335 overexpression could not only increase tumor sensitivity to radiation or chemical therapy but also inhibit tumor metastasis or re-initiation of tumor growth.","DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most common forms of DNA damage in humans and animals. In this study, we describe a new ATM–mediated DSB–induced DNA damage response pathway involving microRNA (miRNA). We show that IR-induced DSBs activate ATM, leads to downregulation of miR-335, which is an important trigger for DNA end resection and homologous recombination repair (HRR). We demonstrate that CREB is responsible for a large portion of miRNA-335 expression in the promoter region of miRs-335. CREB binding greatly reduced IR, corroborating previous studies in which IR-activated ATM phosphorylates CREB to reduce transcription activity. Overexpression of the miRNA in HeLa cells resulted in reduced CtIP levels and post-IR colony survival, and reduced BRCA1 foci formation. These findings strongly suggest that the ATM–dependent CREB–mRNA–coding pathway influences the selection of HRR repair in certain DSB lesions."

Recently, it has been shown that an indigenous Amerindian group, the Chachi, living in a rural and remote tropical area of Ecuador, are infected with this parasite. The epidemiology and life cycle of this parasite remains elusive, and research is needed to understand the mode of transmission and zoonotic potential of the parasite. It was hypothesized that the domestic animals of the Chachi households may act as definitive and reservoir hosts for Amphimerus infection. Hence, the presence and prevalence of infection in these animals residing in communities endemic for human amphimeriasis was investigated. Some 45 animal stool samples were examined microscopically for the presence of Amphimerus eggs. The results showed an infection rate of 71.4% in cats and 38.7% in dogs. The data provided evidence that these domestic animals act as both definitive and reservoir hosts for the parasite and that amphimeriasis is a zoonotic disease. The implementation of a mass treatment/control program must target both humans and animals in order to minimize the transmission of this liver fluke.","Amphimerus sp. liver fluke has recently shown a high prevalence of infection in the indigenous group, Chachi, which reside in the tropical rainforest of northwestern region of Ecuador.

We found that the prevalence was 71.4% in cats and 38.7% in dogs, similar to the rates in other communities. Significantly, cats were infected in dogs (p = 0.042). The data indicate that the high rate of the parasite infection was due to the high rates of parasite infection among domestic cats, dogs and humans residing in these communities.

HIV has a spike density that is almost two orders of magnitude lower than other viruses. This unique feature of HIV has defied explanation since it was first observed. By bringing together theory and computation, rooted in statistical mechanics, with immunology we suggest that the effects of dramatic depletion of T helper cells during HIV infection on antibody production provided an evolutionary driving force for HIV to evolve a low spike density in order to avoid potent immune responses. Additionally, we show that an intermediate spike density induces maximally potent antibody production, a result with implications for vaccine design.","High spike densities (SDs) promote infection, and spikes are targets of antibody-mediated immune responses. However, diverse evolutionary pressures influence virus SDs. HIV SDs are orders of magnitude lower than those of other viruses, a surprising feature of unknown origin. Here, we show that the intermediate SD maximizes the affinity generated by generated antibodies. We find that T helper cells, depleted early in HIV infection, play a key role in antibody evolution. We also find that the T helper cell depletion results in high affinity antibodies at SD high, SD low. This special feature of HIV infection led to the evolution of low SDs to avoid potent immune responses early in infection."

Although some of the major targets of activity-dependent phospho-signalling have been identified, a large number of substrates remain unknown. Here, we have screened systematically for these substrates and extended the list from hundreds to thousands of phosphorylation sites, thereby providing a new depth of understanding. We monitored phospho-signalling for 15 min after the stimulation, which to our knowledge had not been attempted at a large scale. We focused on presynaptic protein substrates of phospho-signalling by isolating the presynaptic terminal. We also stimulated hippocampal neurons but did not monitor the poststimulus. Although the phospho-signalling is immensely complex, the findings could be simplified through data exploration. We identified distinct patterns of presynaptic phospho-regulation across the time course that may constitute co-regulated protein networks. In addition, we found a subset of proteins that had many more phosphorylation sites than the average and high-magnitude responses, implying major signalling or functional roles for these proteins. We also determined the likely protein kinases with the strongest responses to the stimulus at different times using KinSwing, a computational tool that we developed. This resource reveals a new depth of activity-dependent phospho-signalling and identifies major signalling targets, major protein kinases, and co-regulated phosphoprotein networks.","Protein kinases play an important role in the plasticity of synaptic plasticity. They are involved in the regulation of phosphorylation-based signalling. Here, we present a global temporal profile of presynaptic activity-dependent phospho-signalling, which includes KCl stimulation levels in the poststimulus period. We profiled 1,917 regulated phosphopeptides and bioinformatically identified temporal patterns of co-regulated proteins. We found that the activity of these proteins was prominently regulated in the analysis of 7,070 activity-dependently regulated protein kinases in cultured hippocampal neurons. Active zone scaffold proteins showed a high level of activity-independent phosphorylating and far exceeded the response of postsynaptic density and scaffold protein kinase activity. Accordingly, bassoon was identified as a major target of neuronal phospho -signalling. We developed a probabilistic computational method, KinSwing, to match protein and substrate motifs regulated by phosphorylated sites. Our approach allowed us to link protein and kinases profiles in co-regulatory networks. Our work provides a unique resource for the detailed characterization of the phospho–regulated mechanisms impacting plasticity and neurotransmitter release."

The benefits are many and it is commonly believed that modern brain functions have emerged from ancestral forms evolved for effective navigation. Since the time of Charles Darwin, it has been recognized that path integration is a navigation strategy innate to many species. Path integration involves adding the stepwise displacements during a circuitous journey to compute a net homeward direction. Over the past century, this phenomenon has been described for birds to mammals to arthropods, and a long list of mathematical, algorithmic, and neural network models have been proposed to explain the necessary computations. This work shows how the different types of models behave in the presence of noise. It turns out that only one class of models can function properly in the presence of noise. Since noise appears to be present at all levels of brain physiology, we arrive at the surprising conclusion that the general computational principles for path integration must be the same across all species. Two subtypes of path integration models share the same critical computational principles, and are compared to known neuroanatomy and physiology.","Path integration is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous navigation strategies in the animal kingdom. Path integration has been proposed as a novel, unifying classification system for neural representation of space. Here, we combine theoretical framework and recent insights directed by walk theory, to develop an intuitive mathematically rigorous proof class of neural representations of space that can tolerate noise. Our result suggests that existing models of path integration are biologically plausible for intolerance to noise. This surprising result imposes significant computational limitations in neurobiological spatial representation of successfully navigating animals, irrespective of species. However, noise-tolerance is an important functional constraint in the evolution of neuroarchitectural plans of the animals kingdom."

Despite unequivocal evidence for a short physiological length of ~55–65 nm at rest, spectrin is typically represented as an extended ~200 nm molecule that is implied based on crystallographic structures of a number of tandem repeats. Here, we incorporate previously reported biochemical and crystallographic data with structural mass spectroscopy and electron microscopic data to derive a detailed, experimentally-supported quaternary structure of the physiological compact form of spectrin. In addition to explaining spectrin’s physiological resting length (~55–65 nm), our model provides a mechanism by which spectrin can undergo a seamless three-fold extension, which is an experimentally observed property that is responsible for restoration of cell shape after mechanical deformation.","The molecular structure of spectrin is poorly understood. In this study, we combine previously reported biochemical and high-resolution crystallographic data with structural mass spectroscopy and electron microscopic data to derive a detailed, experimentally-supported quaternary structure of the spectrin heterotetramer. In addition to explaining spectrin physiological resting length ~55-65 nm, our model provides a mechanism for spectrin to undergo a seamless-fold extension of the remaining linear filament, an experimentally observed property. Our proposed model is similar to the Chinese Finger Trap: shorter molecular lengths in spectrin hollow cylinder extend by increasing the pitch of a spectrin repeat, decreases the internal diameter, and decreases its internal diameter. Our model is supported by zero-length chemical crosslink data and is indicative of approximately 90 degree bend of adjacent spectrin repeats. The domain-domain interactions model is entirely consistent with the present prototypical linear antiparallel heterosetramer and recently reported inter-strand chemical crosslinks. The model is consistent with known physical properties and spectrin, and the extension of this Chinese Finger trap Model reduces the ~180-200 nm molecular model currently common use."

In this work, we challenge the role of the plasma membrane in the regulation of virus propagation.

The latter events occur despite the presence of immune IgG antibodies. IgG acts by neutralization of virions and activation of immune cells bearing one or more surface receptors, called FcγRs, recognizing the constant Fc domain of IgG. Activating FcγRs induce a wide range of immune responses, including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of virus-infected cells by natural killer (NK) cells, cytokine secretion and the uptake of immune complexes to enhance antigen presentation to T cells. We demonstrate that the HCMV glycoproteins RL11/gp34 and UL119-118/gp68 block IgG-mediated activation of FcγRs. A novel reporter cell-based assay was used to test FcγRs individually and assess their relative susceptibility to each antagonist. This approach revealed that gp34 and gp68 block triggering of activating FcγRs, i.e. FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32A) and FcγRIII (CD16). Co-immunoprecipitation showed the formation of ternary complexes containing IgG, IgG-bound antigen and the viral antagonists on the cell surface. Assigning the redundant abilities of HCMV to hinder IgG effector responses to the viral Fc binding proteins, we discuss gp34 and gp68 as potential culprits which might contribute to the limited efficacy of therapeutic IgG against HCMV.","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establishes lifelong infection and recurrent episodes of virus production shedding despite the presence of adaptive immunological memory responses including HCMV immune immunoglobulin G (IgG). However, little is known about how HCMV evades humoral cellular IgG-dependent immune responses.

(L.) amazonensis are protozoa that infect macrophages and cause cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis. Here we showed that both Leishmania species induce the production of IL-32γ in human macrophages. This intracellular and pro-inflammatory cytokine mediates the production of cytokines, especially TNFα and IL-8, in Leishmania-infected macrophages. Differential effects of IL-32γ on TNFα, IL-10 and IL-1Ra production after infection with distinct Leishmania species were detected, consistent with the concept that IL-32γ can differently influence the outcome of inflammatory process in leishmaniasis lesions. Moreover, IL-32γ upregulates microbicidal molecules, antimicrobial peptides, as well as NO, which are known as important factors in parasite control. These results underscore IL-32γ as a crucial cytokine to host defense against leishmaniasis.","Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is a parasitic disease caused by the parasite Leishmania braziliensis and L. amazonensis.

A wide range of evidence also suggests that the earliest life forms on Earth likewise derived their carbon from . From these two observations one can assume that the global biological carbon cycle has always been based on , and we show here that this assumption can be used as a powerful constraint to help organize and explain the deep evolution of life on Earth. Using a novel method that fully integrates aspects of metabolic and phylogenetic analysis, we are able to reconstruct the complete early evolutionary history of biological carbon-fixation, relating all ways in which life today performs this function to a single ancestral form. The diversification in carbon-fixation appears to underpin most of the deepest branches in the tree of life, and this early metabolic diversification – reaching back to the first cells – appears to have been driven not by the contingencies of history, but by direct links to the physical-chemical environment. The ancestral carbon-fixation pathway that we identify is different from any modern form, but better suited to the capabilities of the earliest primitive cells.","The evolution of carbon fixation is a complex process that involves a variety of biological processes. It is one of the most important biological processes in living organisms, and it is essential to understand the evolution of this process. In this study, we reconstruct the complete early evolutionary history of biological carbon-fixation, relating modern pathways to a single ancestral form. We find that innovations in carbon- fixation are the foundation for major early divergences in tree life. Our findings are based on a novel method that fully integrates metabolic and phylogenetic constraints. Comparing gene- profiles of metabolic cores in deep- branching organisms requiring capable synthesizing biomass components leads to a surprising conclusion: a common form of deep-bending autotrophic carbon-c fixation combines disconnected sub-network, supplying carbon to distinct biomass components. The linear folate-based pathway combines the reductive citric acid cycle of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway with a single connected network. The linked network lacks selective optimization of modern fixation pathways, and redundancy leads to robust topology, making it a plausible modern pathway to a primitive universal ancestor form."

We sequenced the genome of the closest known endemic relative of M. graminicola infecting wild grass hosts. A comparative genome analysis allowed us to infer how speciation and host specialization processes have influenced pathogen evolution. The wild grass-adapted pathogen can infect wheat, but M. graminicola shows a significantly higher degree of host specificity and virulence in a detached leaf assay. The genomes of the pathogens are 7% divergent with a high degree of synteny in the 13 essential core chromosomes. However, structural rearrangements have strongly affected eight small dispensable chromosomes. These chromosomes also show altered rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions. We found 43 genes showing evidence of positive selection. As the divergence of species occurred very recently, these genes are likely involved in host specialization or speciation. None of the genes have a known function, although one encodes a signal peptide and is a potential pathogen effector. We conclude that the genomic basis of the rapid emergence of the wheat-specialized pathogen M. graminicola has involved structural changes in the eight dispensable chromosomes and positive selection in a small number of genes.","The fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola is a pathogen that infects wheat and grasses. It was first discovered in the Fertile Crescent region of North America about 10,000–12,000 years ago. The wheat-infecting lineage emerged as closely related to Mycophaerella pathogens infecting wild grasses, but the divergence of the pathogen and its closest known progenitor species is named M. Graminicola S1. The genome of S1 was obtained using Illumina sequencing resulting in 35 Mb draft genome sequence 32X. Assembled contigs aligned with previously sequenced M. graminicol genome, the alignment covered >90% of the non- repetitive portion of the M. species genome, with an average divergence of 7%. We found that structural rearrangements significantly affected the number of essential chromosomes plus the proportion of syntenic chromosomes. At the nucleotide level, essential chromosomes evolved differently. The average synonymous substitution rate for dispensable chromosomes was considerably lower than for essential chromosomes, and the average non-synonymous substitution rate was three times higher. Differences in molecular evolution related to different transmission and recombination patterns, differences in effective population sizes, and differences in the effective population size of essential and dispensable chromosome. In order to identify genes potentially involved in host specialization speciation, we calculated the ratios of synonymous and non- synonymous substitution rates to >9,500 aligned protein coding genes. We identified 43 candidate genes showing evidence of positive selection, encoding a potential pathogen effector protein. We conclude that divergence of pathogens is accompanied by structural changes in the genome structure and that positive selection may present a small number of protein coding gene."

The role of specific brain areas in sensory perception is typically studied using two kinds of laboratory experiments: those that measure correlations between neural activity and reported percepts, and those that inactivate a brain region and measure the resulting changes in percepts. The two types of experiments have generally been interpreted in isolation, in part because no theory has been able combine their outcomes. Here, we describe a mathematical framework that synthesizes both kinds of results, giving us a new way to assess how different brain areas contribute to perception. When we apply our framework to experiments on behaving monkeys, we discover two models that can explain the perplexing finding that one brain area can predict an animal’s reported percepts, even though the percepts are not affected when that brain area is inactivated. The two models ascribe dramatically different efficiencies to brain computation. We show that these two models could be distinguished by a proposed experiment that measures correlations while inactivating different brain areas.","Neurons play an important role in perception, but how they do so is still poorly understood. In this paper, we address this question by applying a technique to the brain of macaque monkeys trained to perform a heading discrimination task. We identify two competing decoding schemes, consistent data depending on the nature of correlated noise. The theory makes specific testable predictions to distinguish scenarios experimentally requiring measurement of underlying noise correlations. Theories focus on choice-related neuronal activity and reconcile findings from additional experiments involving large-scale recordings to measure interneuronal correlations. By expanding current theories of neural coding incorporating results from inactivation experiments, we demonstrate that it is possible to infer decoding weights from different brain areas at a coarse scale with precise knowledge of correlation structure."

There is much disagreement in the literature with regard to the dominant route of influenza transmission. Using empirical estimates where possible, we vary 18 parameters which are relevant to these transmission routes. These parameters are features of the agent, host, or environment. Depending on these features, a specific route or routes may be operating at a high intensity. Thus, it is unlikely there is a single universal dominant influenza transmission route. Therefore, interventions which target only one of these routes will not be optimal in all settings. It is important to understand the context in terms of the agent, host, and environment in order to develop optimal environmental intervention strategies.","Influenza is transmitted by respirable (small airborne particles), inspirable ( intermediate size), direct-droplet-spray, and contact modes. These modes are affected by the features of the virus strain (infectivity, survivability, transferability, shedding profiles) and the host population. The environment (host density, surface area volume ratios, host movement patterns) has recently come into investigation. Here, we use a discrete-event, continuous-time, stochastic transmission model to analyze the environmental processes that affect the transmission of influenza. We find that the inspiratory route is more likely to cause high transmission isolation modes than the direct-d droplet spray mode. Depending on the context, the modes are sufficient to cause the high transmission, and contexts of transmission result. However, when making intervention decisions that involve blocking environmental pathways, generic recommendations can be applied indiscriminately and ineffective; instead, the intervention choice can be contextualized, depending on the specific features of people, virus strain, and the venue in question."

As Fasciola is highly endemic in some regions of the developing world, our study shed light on the complications of this parasitic infection which are not that different from flukes such as Schistosoma or Opisthorchis. We believe that further investigations are needed in order to elucidate the pathways in how F. hepatica infection causes liver damage.","Fascioliasis is a parasitic disease that is associated with liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and cancer. In order to describe the current evidence, we carried out a systematic review to assess the association between F. hepatica and liver cancer. We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases ( PubMed, LILACS, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, Scielo) and found 1,557 published studies. 21 studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 studies explored the association with F. liver and fibrosis. Globally studies suggested that the ability of F. hepatatica to promote liver cancer is unknown. Given the heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis was performed. Future high-quality studies are needed to determine the role of the F. Hepatica in the development and development of liver cancer in humans."

Targeting the mTORC1/4E-BPs/eIF4E axis is a promising strategy in cancer therapies and for preventing resistance to treatment. Enhanced mTORC1 activity also drives innate immune responses by modulating protein expression of antiviral genes. It was previously shown that the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin limits antiviral responses and promotes replication of oncolytic viruses within tumour tissues. Active-site dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitors (asTORi) have been developed for superior mTOR inhibition and anti-cancer potency but have not been studied in the context of oncolytic viral infection. We show here that prolonged treatment with asTORi strongly augments infection of HSV1-dICP0 in cancer cells, but not in normal cells, an effect modulated via eIF4E/4E-BP expression. Thus, cancer cells with dysregulated translation could be amenable to the pharmacoviral combination of HSV1 and asTORi treatment.","Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1) is one of the most important oncolytic virus platforms. However, efficient sustained viral replication in tumours is limiting. Rapamycin has been shown to stimulate HSV1 replication in cancer cells, whereas active-site dual mTORC1 and mTORc2 ( mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 2) inhibitors (asTORi) have shown to suppress virus replication in normal cells. Surprisingly, infected cell protein 0 (ICP0)-deleted HSV-dICP0, however, was found to markedly augment infection of cancer cells in mouse and mammary cancer xenograft. Mechanistically, asTORi repressed mRNA translation of normal cells, resulting in a defective antiviral response and inhibition of HSV 1-dicP0 replication. AsTORi also reduced the expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and silenced repressors of eIF4e binding proteins (4E-BPs), thereby supporting increased viral replication. Our data suggest that a pharmacoviral combination of asTORI and asTORC2 may be able to inhibit HSV2 replication in tumor cells, thereby promoting increased virus replication."

Consequences of infection include anemia, stunted growth, liver abnormalities, and subfertility. Currently, the main approach to schistosomiasis control involves mass preventive treatment of school-aged children in endemic areas. The treatment, praziquantel, can be distributed through school-based, community-based, or combined school- and community-based systems. The first part of this systematic review compared the three delivery modes and found that combined delivery resulted in the best overall coverage of school-aged children, with community-only delivery the next-best approach. School-only delivery not only had the lowest overall coverage, but especially fell behind in targeting children not enrolled in school. As a whole, these results support the more frequent use of a combined approach to delivery in order to achieve the highest coverage rates and ensure that out-of-school children are not left persistently untreated. In the second part of this review the qualitative factors affecting program success were examined. The results indicate that overall treatment coverage can be improved via small interventions, such as snacks for participating children to reduce drug side effects, educational campaigns about schistosomiasis, incentives for drug distributors, and active inclusion of marginalized groups.","The mainstay of current schistosomiasis control programs is mass preventive chemotherapy of school-aged children with praziquantel. The treatment is delivered by school-based, community-based and combined school- and community-school-based systems. Attaining high coverage rates of children is essential for mass schistomiasis treatment programs, ensuring persistently untreated subpopulations, and a potential challenge for school- based programs in areas with low school enrollment. In this review, we sought to compare different treatment delivery methods based on coverage of school aged children and overall coverage of specifically non-en enrolled children. In addition, qualitative community programmatic factors associated with high and low coverage rates were identified, and suggestions for overall coverage improvement were identified. The review was registered prospectively by PROSPERO (CRD 42015017656) and was published in October 2015, with potential relevance identified in database searches, reference lists, personal communications, and personal communications. Eligible studies were included in a systematic review of the coverage rates and coverage of MDA school-age children in the United States.

We have identified an Arabidopsis thaliana hybrid with several aberrant growth phenotypes that are caused by divergence at a single locus encoding the receptor-like kinase OUTGROWTH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN KINASE (OAK). OAK belongs to a group of similar genes arranged in a tandem cluster that varies substantially between A. thaliana strains. OAK originated through duplication within the cluster with concurrent recruitment of coding sequences from nearby genes to form a new promoter with a novel expression pattern. Kinase activity of OAK is required for its effects, indicating that it is not recognition of an aberrant protein but rather a true gain of function that leads to the incompatibility. Most of the incompatibility seems to come from divergence within the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the OAK protein, indicating that heterodimers of OAK may have higher affinity for a natural substrate compared to either homodimer. Finally, mis-expression of the incompatible OAK alleles from the promoter present in the reference strain of A. thaliana also leads to genetic incompatibility, but with different phenotypic outcomes.","Non-additive interactions between genomes have important implications, practical applications for breeding, and understanding evolution. In extreme cases, genes from different genomic backgrounds are incompatible to compromise normal development and physiology. One of the most important cases of genetic over-underdominance affecting plant growth and fitness is the loss of hybrid vigor. Despite its importance, the relationship between biochemical and fitness effects of complex: genetic overdominance, increased novel activity of a gene, and evolutionary underdominance are expressed in hybrid weakness. In this work, we describe the interaction between alleles of Arabidopsis thaliana OAK (OUTGROWTH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN KINASE) gene. OAK alleles from different accessions interact with F1 hybrids and cause a variety of aberrant growth phenotypes that depend on a recently acquired promoter and a novel expression pattern. We show that OAK gene is located in a highly variable tandem array encoding closely related receptor-like kinases, and that the OAK kinase activity is required for aberrant phenotypes. Our work provides insights into how tandem arrays, particularly prone to frequent, complex rearrangements, produce genetic novelty."

Previously, extensive research has focused on the molecular mechanisms of biological processes in yeast, but many questions regarding yeast budding remain unsolved. For example, how do different budding patterns affect yeast colony growth? How does declined spatial order due to aging impact the colony at the population level? To address these questions, we developed a computational agent-based model, which incorporates key biological processes, the effect of aging, as well as cell-environment interaction. We performed and analyzed a large number of simulations for a variety of situations, and obtained insightful results. We found that axial budding pattern enhances the percentage of diploid cells at early stage and bipolar budding pattern improves colony development under nutrient limitation; the frequency of mating type switch might control the trade-off between diploidization and inbreeding; aging affects the percentage of diploid cells in colonies initiated by a single haploid cell, but does not have much influence in the expansion of colonies initiated by diploid cells. The framework of the model can be extended to study other important systems, such as tissue with stem cell lineage.","Budding yeast undergoes polarized growth during budding and mating, a useful model system to study cell polarization. Bud sites are selected differently from haploid and diploid yeast cells: haploid cells bud in an axial manner, diploids in a bud bipolar manner. While previous studies have focused on molecular details of bud site selection and polarity establishment, it is known that different budding patterns rise in different functions at the population level. In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional agent-based model to study budding yeast colonies in cell-type specific biological processes, budding, mating, mating type switch, consumption of nutrients, and cell death. Our model demonstrates that the axial budding pattern enhances mating probability at the early stage of the bipolar budding pattern and improves colony development and nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that the frequency of mating type change and the timing of the trade-off between inbreeding and inbreeding may control cell aging."

However, disease burden has primarily been estimated at the national scale, which does not account for sub-country variations in burden levels. We used the case of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a highly focal NTD, in Uganda to calculate and map burden in DALYs. Our results show that HAT burden is highly sensitive to under-reporting estimates, and is particularly high in heavily affected parishes and districts of Uganda. Some districts in southeastern Uganda had HAT burden rates comparable to the national burden rates of major infectious diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS. Thus, the spatial scale of burden estimation is crucial, especially for focal diseases such as HAT, and national-level estimates may not reflect the level of impact in afflicted communities. We recommend sub-country burden estimation to identify key areas for prioritization of disease surveillance and targeted interventions.","Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world. The prevalence of HAT in Uganda is estimated based on age and mortality distributions, mapped by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, and summarised in a parish district in Uganda.

The interferons (IFNs) are strongly induced by IAV and are known to mediate host resistance to the infection. However, in contrast to their well-studied inhibitory effect on viral replication, the effects of IFNs on host inflammatory responses are less well understood. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that anti-viral IFN signaling is also required for the orchestration of a tissue response associated with the protection against IAV infection in mice. Importantly, we identify that type I IFNs cross-regulate and cooperate with IFN-γ to inhibit monocyte activation and neutrophil infiltration, respectively. This study also demonstrates that Ly6Clo monocytes/macrophages can potentially mediate influenza virus-induced inflammation, suggesting that IFNs dictate the homeostasis versus inflammatory function of mononuclear phagocytes in viral infection. Our study reveals a novel IFN-dependent regulatory mechanism designed to prevent the excessive immunopathology while preserving its anti-microbial functions. Moreover, these observations have particular relevance for understanding the mechanisms underlying the strong inflammatory response associated with lethal IAV strains and have implications for the development of new immunotherapies to treat influenza.","Host control of influenza virus (IAV) is associated with exuberant pulmonary inflammation characterized by the influx of myeloid cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines including interferons (IFNs). However, it is unclear how the immune system clears the virus causing lethal immunopathology. Here, we demonstrate that IFN signaling coordinates host inflammation in IAV-infected mice. This regulatory mechanism is dependent on type IFN IFN-γ receptor signaling, and importantly, requires functional interplay pathways. We show that type IFNs preferentially regulate the recruitment of classical inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes to IAV infected lungs, and that this cooperation is sufficient for preventing neutrophil recruitment into lungs of IAV infection-infecting mice. However, the cooperation between type and ILN signaling is required for the tissue neutrophilic response.

This analysis provides genome-wide evidence that microRNA genes have the same type of promoter sequences as protein-coding genes, and therefore are likely transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II). Second, we present a novel computational method for promoter prediction, which is then applied to locate the core promoters of known microRNA genes in the four model species.

Individuals with ASD frequently have a larger and more rapidly growing brain than their typically developing peers. Given the widely documented heritability suggesting that ASD is predominantly a genetic condition and the well-established link between ASD and abnormal brain growth patterns, genes involved in brain growth would be excellent candidates to study regarding ASD. One such candidate is DUF1220, a highly copy number polymorphic protein domain that we have previously linked to brain evolution and brain size. However, due to the extreme copy number variability of DUF1220, it has not been directly investigated in previous genome wide polymorphism studies searching for genes important in ASD. Here we show that, in individuals with ASD, 1) DUF1220 subtype CON1 is highly variable, ranging from 56 to 88 copies, and 2) the copy number of CON1 is associated, in a linear dose-response manner, with increased severity of each of the three primary symptoms of ASD: as CON1 copy number increases each of the three primary symptoms of ASD (impaired social reciprocity, impaired communicative ability and increased repetitive behaviors) become incrementally worse.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the world. It is caused by mutations in the DUF1220 protein domain (CON1) that are associated with increased brain size.

We found that individuals with ASD CON1 copy number were linearly associated with a dose-response manner, with increased severity of primary symptoms of ASD: social deficits (p = 0.021), communicative impairments, repetitive behaviors, and repetitive behaviors. Our data indicate that the dosage of a DUF 1220 subtype of CON1 is an ASD-wide effect, likely a key component of the major pathway underlying ASD severity. Finally, our findings, implicating a dosage previously unexamined, suggest that the copynumber polymorphic in brain evolution-related gene coding sequence may be a major component of ASD severity, and provide an important new direction for research on genetic factors underlying ASD."

Yeast strains used to make ales are known to differ genetically and phenotypically from strains used to make wine and from strains isolated from nature, such as oak isolates. Beer strains are also known to be polyploid, having more than two copies of their genome per cell. To determine the ancestry of beer strains, we compared the genomes of beer strains with the genomes of a large collection of strains isolated from diverse sources and geographic locations. We found ale, baking, and the S. cerevisiae portion of lager strains to have ancestry that is a mixture of European grape wine strains and Asian rice wine strains and that they carry novel alleles from an extinct or uncharacterized population. The mixed ancestry of beer strains has been maintained in a polyploid state, which provided a means of strain diversification through gain or loss of genetic variation within a strain but also a means of maintaining brewing characteristics by reducing or eliminating genetic exchange with other strains. Our results show that ale strains emerged from a mixture of previously used fermentation technology.","The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for the production of beer, bread, wine, and other food products. It was domesticated from wild populations associated with trees.

We examined the population genetic history of beer strains found in ale strains and lager strains derived from admixture populations with closely related European grape wine strains and Asian rice wine strains. Similar to lager baking strains, ale strains are polyploid, providing a passive means of remaining isolated from populations providing a living relic of ancestral hybridization. We also found that ale strains contain novel alleles derived from extinct and uncharacterized populations. We conclude that modern beer strains are product of historical melting pot fermentation technology."

Further comparison of individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria revealed the most immunogenic Plasmodium antigens, as well as antigens that were recognized with greater intensity in individuals that were asymptomatic at the point of sample collection.

In this study, we describe the serological profiling of immune responses at malaria sites in India probing protein microarrays consisting of 515 and 500 of these proteins and 353 plasma samples. A total of 236 malaria-positive ( symptomatic and asymptomatic) and 117 malaria-negative samples were collected from field sites in Raurkela, Nadiad, Chennai. Indian samples showed significant seroreactivity of 265 and 373 P. vivax and P. falcaparum antigens, respectively. Overall, the overall levels of the immune responses were lower than those of the other two species of malaria parasite. We also identified the immunogenic and non-pathogenic antigen of the two major PlASmodium species recognized in India, which are associated with both symptomatic malaria and malaria. Our results suggest that targeted surveillance approaches tailored to diverse epidemiology of malaria are tailored to the malaria world."

Facilitated by their ancient association with intracellular symbiotic bacteria that synthesize essential amino acids, aphids feed on phloem (sap). Exploitation of a diversity of long-lived woody and short-lived herbaceous hosts by many aphid species is a result of specializations that allow aphids to discover and exploit suitable host plants. Such specializations include production by a single genotype of multiple alternative phenotypes including asexual, sexual, winged, and unwinged forms. We have generated a draft genome sequence of the pea aphid, an aphid that is a model for the study of symbiosis, development, and host plant specialization. Some of the many highlights of our genome analysis include an expanded total gene set with remarkable levels of gene duplication, as well as aphid-lineage-specific gene losses. We find that the pea aphid genome contains all genes required for epigenetic regulation by methylation, that genes encoding the synthesis of a number of essential amino acids are distributed between the genomes of the pea aphid and its symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, and that many genes encoding immune system components are absent. These genome data will form the basis for future aphid research and have already underpinned a variety of genome-wide approaches to understanding aphid biology.","Aphids are important agricultural pests and biological models for studies of insect-plant interactions, symbiosis, virus vectoring, and developmental causes of extreme phenotypic plasticity. We present a 464 Mb draft genome assembly of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. The genome sequence of the basal hemimetabolous insect provides an outgroup of multiple published genomes of holometabolous insects. Pea aphids are host-plant specialists, reproduce sexually asexually, coevolved with an obligate bacterial symbiont. We highlight the findings of genome analysis related to unusual biological features. Gene family expansions relative to published genomes include genes involved in chromatin modification, miRNA synthesis, and sugar transport. Gene losses include genes in the central IMD immune pathway, selenoprotein utilization, purine salvage, and the entire urea cycle. Our analysis of the genome reveals a limited number of genes acquired from bacteria; reduced gene count in Buchnera reflect gene transfer from the host to the host genome. Our findings suggest extensive metabolite exchange between the aphid and the bacterium, including sharing amino acid biosynthesis and aphid metabolism. These findings provide a foundation for post-genomic studies of fundamental biological questions applied to agricultural problems."

These stages of the life cycle are often initiated by environmental conditions and occur seasonally. However, many herbaceous perennial species such as strawberry, rose, or Arabis alpina contain varieties that flower continuously irrespective of the seasons. Here we characterize this genetic variation in A. alpina and show that five continuously flowering accessions carry independent mutations in the PERPETUAL FLOWERING 1 (PEP1) gene. These mutations impair the activity of the PEP1 floral repressor causing the plants to flower without requirement for winter cold and to flower continuously. This result has interesting parallels with strawberry and rose, where inactivation of a different floral repressor controlling response to day length gives rise to naturally occurring perpetual flowering forms. We also show that PEP1 in A. alpina has a complex duplicated structure that gives rise to two overlapping transcripts. This arrangement differs from the simple structure of PEP1 orthologues in related annual species, such as FLC of Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that duplication of PEP1 might contribute to the complex transcriptional patterns associated with PEP1 function in perennials. Our work provides insight into genetic variation contributing to the perennial life history of plants.","Many plants exhibit a variety of different life histories. For example, annual plants live a year flowering and produce seeds that are senesce. In contrast, perennials live two years, dividing life cycle episodes between vegetative growth and flowering. Environmental cues control key check points in the life histories of annuals. Genes controlling responses to environmental cues exhibit natural genetic variation. Here, we characterize the genetic variation conferring differences in the perennial life cycle of Arabis alpina. Previously, we show that accessions to Pajares require a prolonged exposure to cold (ivernalization) and a limited period of returning to growth. Genetic complementation showed that these accessions carry mutant alleles of PERPETUAL FLOWERING 1 (PEP1), which encodes the MADS box transcription factor orthologous to the FLOWERing LOCUS C in annual Arabidopsis thaliana. We also show that the PEP1 locus contains a tandem arrangement of length and partial PEP 1 copy, and rise-length transcripts are differentially expressed. These results provide a paradigm for how perennial phenotypes arise."

Dengue non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is an essential, multifunctional, viral enzyme with two distinct domains; a protease domain required for processing of the viral polyprotein, and a helicase domain required for replication of the viral genome. In this study ten unique human antibody fragments (Fab) that specifically bind dengue NS3 were isolated from a diverse library of Fab clones using phage display technology. The binding site of one of these antibodies, Fab 3F8, has been precisely mapped to the third α-helix within subdomain III of the helicase domain (amino acids 526–531). The antibody inhibits the helicase activity of NS3 in biochemical assays and reduces DENV replication in human embryonic kidney cells. The antibody is a valuable tool for studying dengue replication mechanisms.","The flavivirus non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is essential for virus replication.

Here, we explored whether various mutations in colorectal tumors are correlated with specific changes in the bacterial communities that live in and on these tumors. We find that the genes and biological pathways that are mutated in tumors are correlated with variation in the composition of the microbiome. This study provides a step towards understanding interactions between tumor genes and the microbiome in colorectal cancer.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The disease is caused by mutations in the gut microbiome, which are associated with a variety of cancer-related genes, including MAPK and Wnt signaling. However, it is not clear how these mutations interact with the surrounding tumor microbiome. Here, we characterized the association between CRC microbial communities and tumor mutations using microbiome profiling-exome sequencing of 44 pairs of tumors matched to normal tissues. We found statistically significant associations between loss-of-function mutations in tumor genes and shifts in abundances of specific sets of bacterial taxa, suggestive of a functional interaction. This correlation allows us to statistically predict the interactions between loss and-function tumor mutations and cancer-associated genes and pathways. We also show that CRC microbiomes correlated with tumor mutational profiles, pointing to possible mechanisms of molecular interaction."

This specialization is thought to be regulated via response thresholds to task-specific cues, which vary between workers conducting different tasks. Whether a worker takes care of the brood, cares for other workers, or leaves the nest to search for food is influenced by age, fat content, and the expression of associated genes. In the ant Temnothorax longispinosus, workers specializing in brood care are younger and exhibit a high expression of the gene Vg-like A. Here, we demonstrate that young workers reduce brood care activity upon down-regulation of Vg-like A. Simultaneously, they increase care for adult nestmates, a behavior typically exhibited by older workers. We show experimentally that Vg-like A down-regulation alters perception of social cues: a shift in the responsiveness from chemical cues from brood to adult worker underlies the behavioral switch to nestmate care. Hence, the expression of Vg-like A and its associated pathways influences task choice in ants and is involved in the regulation of division of labor. Copies of Vg-like A are present in other ants and further social and solitary insects, and future studies will reveal the role of this gene in these organisms.","Insect societies are characterized by division of labor, with workers specializing in brood care early in foraging and later in life. Theory posits that task switching requires shifts in responsiveness to task-related cues, but experimental evidence is weak. Here, we show that Vitellogenin (Vg), an ortholog of the Vg gene cluster, is involved in this process: phylogenetic analyses of Vg Vg-like genes revealed that the honey bee Vg falls into a separate Vg–like cluster. Secondly, experimental knockdown of VG-like fat body caused a reduction of brood care and an increase in nestmate care for young ant workers. We demonstrate experimentally that the task switch is partly based on changes in social cue responsiveness to brood worker cues, and that this is a novel mechanism leading to early behavioral maturation. Our results suggest that Vg and other related pathways may play a role in regulating division labor."

These are made approximately three to four times every second, and larger saccades result from fast and concurrent movement of the animal's eyes and head. Experimental studies have revealed that during saccades, the motor system follows certain principles such as respecting a specific relationship between the relative contribution of eye and head motor systems to total gaze shift. Various researchers have hypothesized that these principles are implications of some optimality criteria in the brain, but it remains unclear how the brain can learn such an optimal behavior. We propose a new model that uses a plausible learning mechanism to satisfy an optimality criterion. We show that after learning, the model is able to reproduce motor behavior with biologically plausible properties. In addition, it predicts the nature of the learning signals. Further experimental research is necessary to test the validity of our model.","Optimality principles have been proposed to explain the characteristics of coordinated eye head movements in visual orienting behavior. However, it has been suggested that neural models underly generate saccades, which include an online learning mechanism for optimization.

Simulations of the characteristics and coordinated eye-movements generated in this model match experimental data aspects, including the relationship between amplitude, duration, peak velocity and head- restrained relative contribution to eye head total gaze shift under head-free conditions. The model is the first step in bringing the optimality principle to an incremental local learning mechanism."

Although this disease can be quickly lethal to its host, it has persisted on long-term in many rodent populations around the world. The reasons for this persistence remain poorly known. Two mechanisms have been invoked, but not yet explicitly and independently tested: first, the spatial structure of rodent populations (subdivision into several subpopulations) and secondly, the presence of, not only plague-susceptible rodents, but also plague-resistant ones. To gain insight into the role of the above two factors in plague persistence, we analysed a mathematical model of plague propagation. We applied our analyses to the case of Madagascar, where plague has persisted on central highlands since the 1920s and is responsible for about 30% of the human cases worldwide. We found that the long-term persistence of plague can be explained by the presence of any of the above two factors. These results allowed us to propose scenarios to explain the localized presence of plague in the Malagasy highlands, and help understand the persistence of plague in many wild foci.","Bubonic plague is the most common zoonosis in the world, but the factors responsible for persistence of the highly virulent disease remain poorly understood.

Here, we analyse the dynamics of plague propagation in Madagascar, a major focus of the disease endemic in the 1920s and central highlands. By combining deterministic and stochastic analyses, we show that endemicity is favoured by intermediate host population sizes, (i) large host populations, and (ii) the presence of resistant host populations account for plague endemicity, thanks to subdivision and subsequent reduction of size subpopulations, and the extinction- recolonization dynamics of disease. In light of these results, we suggest scenarios that explain the localized presence of plague in Madagascar."

We use a model of oscillatory dynamics superimposed on the space-time structure defined by the connectome, and we analyze the possible regimes of synchronization. Limitations of data analysis are also considered and we show that the choice of the significance threshold for coherence does not essentially impact the statistics of the observed phase lags, although it is crucial for the right detection of statistically significant coherence. Analytical insights are obtained for networks with heterogeneous time-delays, based on the empirical data from the connectome, and these are confirmed by numerical simulations, which show in- or anti-phase synchronization depending on the frequency and the distribution of time-delays. Phase lags are shown to result from inhomogeneous network interactions, so that stronger connected nodes generally phase lag behind the weaker.","Neural oscillations are the most important biological processes in the brain. However, the mechanisms underlying these oscillations remain poorly understood. Here, we use a phenomenological model of delay-combined oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify the underlying principles of spatio-temporal structure that governs phase lags and oscillatory activity in distant regions. Phase relations in regions of stability are derived from numerically confirmed oscillators networks randomly distributed into clustered bimodal delays, which are an approximation of brain structural connectivity. In-phase, clustered delays induce anti-phase synchronization at certain frequencies, and sign lags are determined by natural frequencies of inhomogeneous network interactions.

The inability of HCV to penetrate non-human cells is primarily due to inefficient usage of non-human CD81 and occludin. In this study we adapted HCV to mouse CD81. Efficient utilization of mouse CD81 is conferred by a combination of three mutations in the viral glycoproteins. These changes also permit entry via rat or hamster CD81, and lower viral dependence on additional HCV entry factors. Strikingly, mouse CD81 adapted HCV glycoproteins mediate entry into mouse cells in the absence of human entry factors. The adaptive mutations are not resident in viral domains implicated in direct CD81 binding. Nevertheless, they enhance binding to human CD81, increase susceptibility to different neutralizing antibodies and facilitate induction of viral cell fusion by low pH. This suggests that structural changes accompanied by exposure of the CD81 binding site and neutralizing epitopes have “unlocked” the viral envelope protein complex facilitating infection through non-human entry factors. These results highlight mechanisms of HCV receptor usage and tropism. They also demonstrate that HCV can be adapted to using non-human host factors, which may ultimately facilitate the development of small animal models.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) naturally infects humans and chimpanzees. The determinants responsible for this narrow species tropism have not been defined. Virus cell entry involves the human scavenger receptor class B type (SR-BI), CD81, claudin-1 and occludin.

We have adapted HCV mouse CD81 to a mouse mouse receptor and identified envelope glycoprotein mutations that enhance infection in mouse rodent receptors by approximately 100-fold. These changes were accompanied by enhanced susceptibility to adapted HCVs neutralization and E2-specific antibodies. These findings indicate that adapted HCv is sufficient to overcome the species-based restriction of HCC cell entry in mouse cells."

Hence, cellular signaling pathways operative during viral reactivation could represent potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Our work identifies Pim-1 and Pim-3 kinases as essential key regulators of the gammaherpesvirus life cycle. These kinases target the hallmark of KSHV latency, the LANA protein, by phosphorylation, which abolishes its ability to act as a transcriptional suppressor of viral lytic replication. This study facilitates a deeper understanding of virus–host interactions during reactivation and provides novel opportunities for pharmacological control and intervention also in virus-associated cancers.","The Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is one of the most common herpesviruses in the world. During its life cycle, KSHV is able to switch from productive infection to productive infection. However, it is not clear how this switch occurs. We have recently identified a Pim family kinase, Pim-3, as a novel cellular regulator of viral reactivation. We demonstrate that the expression of this Pim kinase is induced by the physiological chemical reactivation of naturally infected cells. Furthermore, we show that the Pim protein is required for the reactivation and phosphorylating of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) serine residues 205 and 206. These data suggest that Pim proteins are novel cellular regulators of the gammaherpesvirus life cycle and may be novel targets for therapeutic intervention."

Finally , LAB-1 directly interacts GSP-1 GSP-2 . propose LAB-1 targets PP1 homologs chromatin onset meiosis , antagonizing AIR-2 cooperating cohesin complex promote sister chromatid association normal progression meiotic program .","A critical step for achieving successful cell division is the regulation of how the cohesin complexes that bind sister chromatids are initially deposited, then maintained, and finally removed to allow the chromatids to separate into daughter cells. This is particularly challenging during meiosis, when the sister chromatids must remain partially connected to each other through the first division. In organisms that have a single focal centromere on each chromosome, such as mammals and flies, cohesin is protected through the first meiotic division by the protein Shugoshin, which binds the PP2A phosphatase. PP2A counteracts phosphorylation by the Aurora B kinase; if certain cohesins are phosphorylated by Aurora B they become targeted for removal, which allows the chromatids to separate. In the nematode C. elegans, the chromosomes lack a localized centromere and the predicted Shugoshin homolog is not required for protection of cohesins; instead, this function is executed in metaphase of the first meiotic division by the protein LAB-1. But it is not completely understood what leads to the deposition of cohesin prior to entry into meiosis and to its maintenance throughout early meiosis I. In this study, we show that LAB-1 is also required for the loading and maintenance of the cohesin complex. LAB-1 ensures that the chromatids are not separated prematurely, and thus enables the proper progression of events through prophase I of meiosis. We propose that LAB-1 may act at the onset of meiosis in a manner akin to Shugoshin, by recruiting the PP1 phosphatase to counteract Aurora B kinase, thereby ensuring sister chromatid cohesion.","The establishment of a meiotic program depends on the timely establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. LAB-1 has been proposed to act by preventing premature removal of meiosis-specific cohesin REC-8 from the metaphase C. elegans. However, the mechanism of its function remained unknown. Here, we identify an unexpected earlier role for Lab-1 in promoting the establishment of the sister chromatin cohesion during prophase I. We show that loss of this function results in the loss of chromatin dissociation in worms and kleisins mutated. Furthermore, we show that the depletion results in increased Aurora B kinase (AIR-2) signals in early prophase nuclei, coupled with parallel decrease in the signals of the PP1 homolog, GSP-2. Finally, we propose that LAB–1 targets PP1 and GSP2 to antagonize AIR-2 at the onset of meiotic development."

Here, we report the dynamics of   Â      (i) of the epigenetic repression of the H3Lysine9 transcriptome. We find that H3K8me2 is abundant in the chromosomal regions of stem cells, and that it is also present in a large proportion of the genomic regions of the stem cell. We also find that transcriptional changes in H3lysine nine are associated with the global increase of transcriptional and transcriptional repression. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cell differentiation."

The nature of this process depends critically on the weight given to evidence across time: which information has more impact—early, intermediate or late? We used a novel psychophysical technique, which relies on differential temporal dispersion of evidence. This technique allowed us to extract the temporal weights people assign to the flow of evidence. We find that in decisions that are based on relatively short streams of evidence, people gave stronger weight to early information (primacy). Surprisingly, however, with longer streams of evidence, people assigned higher weights to early and late evidence, while underweighting intermediate evidence. This non-monotonic pattern of evidence integration is not predicted by the existing models of decision-making, posing a challenge to current theories. We propose a novel model that accounts for non-monotonic weighting, based on a change in leak and response-competition with integration-time, and we discuss potential neural mechanisms.","Perceptual decisions are thought to be mediated by a mechanism of sequential sampling integration. However, there is noisy evidence that the temporal weighting profile affects decision quality.

Using a signal- perturbation method, we deploys trials set systematically controlled by temporal dispersions of the overall signal, and were able to quantify participants’ temporal weightsing profile. Our results indicate that, at intervals between 1 and 2 sec, participants exhibit a primacy-bias. Moreover, longer stimuli (3-sec) exhibit a temporal weighted profile that is non-monotonic, concurrent with primacy recency, inconsistent with previously suggested computational models of perceptual decision-making ( drift-diffusion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes).

However, they are thought to increase inflammation during highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 infections, which cause severe and often fatal disease in humans. This is based on experiments with human macrophages cultured from monocytes rather than with human AM. Here we show that human AM, collected via broncho-alveolar lavage from healthy volunteers, can become infected with HPAIV H5N1. However, this results in neither induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha nor virus production. Therefore, AM are most likely not responsible for the excessive cytokine response or high viral load during human HPAIV H5N1 infections as assumed previously. These data significantly changes our insight into the pathogenesis of HPAIV H5N1 pneumonia in humans, indicating that other cells than AM must be responsible for the excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine profile observed during HPAIV H5N1 infections.","Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 causes severe, fatal pneumonia in humans.

Even within single polypeptide chains, about 25% of proteins contain self-similar repeating structures, which can be organized in ring-like symmetric arrangements or linear open repeats. The repeats are often related, and thus comparing the sequence and structure of repeats can give an idea as to the early evolutionary history of a protein family. Additionally, the conservation and divergence of repeats can lead to insights about the function of the proteins. This work describes CE-Symm 2.0, a tool for the analysis of protein symmetry. The method automatically detects internal symmetry in protein structures and produces a multiple alignment of structural repeats. The algorithm is able to detect the geometric relationships between the repeats, including cyclic, dihedral, and polyhedral symmetries, translational repeats, and cases where multiple symmetry operators are applicable in a hierarchical manner. These complex relationships can then be visualized in a graphical interface as a complete structure, as a superposition of repeats, or as a multiple alignment of the protein sequence. CE-Symm 2.0 can be systematically used for the automatic detection of internal symmetry in protein structures, or as an interactive tool for the analysis of structural repeats.","Proteins fold into highly regular repetitive dimensional structures.

Here we focus on the relationship between two important layers and follow it over the first five days of differentiation. The first layer – measured by acetylation of one of the histone proteins – describes which parts of the DNA are tightly wrapped up and which lie open. The second layer describes the activity of genes measured by their mRNA expression. Using a wide array of statistical approaches we show that changes in histone acetylation are very predictive for gene expression and that the concordance between the two levels increases over time. Concentrating on genes central to the regulatory networks in embryonic stem cells we find that key genes show very high acetylation signal in the beginning that decreases quickly over time, indicating that they lie in initially open regions that are rapidly closing down. These results are a step forward to a better understanding of the complexities of the relationship between histone acetylation and gene expression, which will help to dissect the multilayer regulatory mechanisms that determine stem cell fate.","Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are cells that can self-renew indefinitely and differentiate into germ layers. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these cells self-rerenew, maintain pluripotency, and lineage specification are poorly understood, and recent results point to a key role for epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we focus on quantifying the impact of histone 3 acetylation (H3K9,14ac) on gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells. We show that changes in histone expression are correlated with changes in mRNA expression and coherence. We also show that the correlation between histone and gene expression increases over time. Our results shed light on the complexity of the relationship between gene expression and histone-acetylation, and suggest that this relationship may be a step forward to dissect multilayer regulatory mechanisms that determine stem cell fate."

Inside these colonies, cells often express many different phenotypes. The significance of these phenotypes often remains unknown. We study the evolution of cell differentiation in the context of surface colonization. We particularly focus on the evolution of a ‘sticky’ cell type that is needed for surface attachment. We show that the sticky cell type readily evolves and escapes from competition in the liquid by attaching to the surface. In most cases, surface colonization is accompanied by phenotypic heterogeneity, in which sticky and non-sticky cell co-occupy the surface. The non-sticky cells hitchhike with the sticky cells, thereby profiting from surface attachment without paying the cost of being sticky. In the presence of regulation, cell differentiation leads to the evolution of intricate bacterial life cycles in which cells alternate between living in surface-attached colonies and living in the liquid. The bacterial life cycles are orchestrated by temporal and spatial pattern formation of cell types. Our model illustrates how cell differentiation can be of key importance for the evolution of bacterial life cycles.","Bacteria live in colonies, where they express different cell types. The ecological significance of these cell types and their evolutionary origin are unknown. Here, we focus on the evolution of the ‘sticky’ cell type required for surface attachment, which is costly to express. We use individual-based simulations to show that surface colonization rapidly evolves in cases that lead to phenotypic heterogeneity, whereas non-stick cells occur on the surface. The presence of regulation, cell differentiation leads to a remarkable set of bacterial life cycles, where cells alternate between living on the living liquid and the living surface. We show that the dominant life stage of a surface-attached colony shows complex features: colonies reproduce fission producing migratory propagules; cells inside the colony divide labour; and colonies produce filaments that facilitate expansion. Overall, our model illustrates the evolution and evolution of an adhesive cell type that goes hand in hand with the complex bacterial life cycle."

Though absent in some species, DNA methylation is conserved across fungi, plants and animals and plays a critical role in X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, transposon silencing etc. In addition, DNA methylation also occurs at the promoter sequence to regulate gene expression. Filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has a well-known mechanism of DNA methylation for genomic defense. During sexual stage repetitive sequences (e.g. transposons) are recognized and point mutations are introduced. During vegetative stage these mutations serve as signals for establishing static DNA methylation to silence all copies of the sequences. In this study, we report a new type of DNA methylation in Neurospora. It is tightly linked to a type of non-coding small RNA termed dicer-independent siRNA (disiRNA) and therefore was termed disiRNA loci DNA methylation (DLDM). DLDM is dynamic regulated and shows an on/off pattern, i.e. most alleles contain no 5mC but some are densely methylated. Interestingly, DLDM can be triggered by convergent transcription and is accumulated at promoter regions. In summary, our findings demonstrate a new type of dynamic DNA methylation.","Cytosine methylation of DNA is an important epigenetic gene silencing mechanism in plants, fungi, and animals. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, nearly all DNA methylations occur in transposon relics and repetitive sequences. However, DNA methylation does not depend on the canonical RNAi pathway. In this study, we describe a new type of methylation associated with disiRNA loci. Unlike previously known DNA-methylation in Neurospora, disiRNAs are highly dynamic and regulated by a mechanism called DLDM. We show that DLDMs is triggered by convergent transcription of enriched promoter regions. Our results establish a new mechanism that triggers DNA methylating."

This reflects the successful evasion and suppression of host immune responses by the parasites. One of the mechanisms that could underlie this phenomenon is modulation of the dendritic cells (DC), which play a central role in initiation and control of T cell responses. Although several in vitro studies have documented the modulatory capacity of Schistosoma antigens on DC function, it is still unclear what effect schistosomiasis has on human DC function in vivo. To address this question, we isolated the two main DC subsets present in peripheral blood from infected and uninfected individuals living in a Schistosoma-endemic area in central Africa, and found that specifically the myeloid DC from Schistosoma-infected subjects displayed an impaired capacity to respond to Toll-like receptor ligands and to drive T cell responses. These findings provide new insights into how schistosomiasis suppresses host immune responses, which can be exploited for new strategies to enhance immunity against the parasites.","Schistosoma haematobium infection is characterized by a state of T cell hyporesponsiveness in the host. Suppression of dendritic cell (DC) function is one of the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Schistosomiasis antigens are potent modulators of DC function in vitro and in vivo. However, it remains unclear how DC function is modulated in chronic human schistosome infection. To address this question, we evaluated the effect of schisto-schistosomal infection on the function of human DC. We found that plasmacytoid (pDC) and myeloid DC (mDC) infected subjects present lower frequencies of peripheral blood mDC and displayed lower expression levels of HLA-DR compared to uninfected individuals. Furthermore, mDC infected subjects, pDC, had reduced capacity to respond to TLR ligands, and we determined MAPK signaling, cytokine production and maturation markers. Finally, we found that the T cell activating capacity of TLR- matured mDC was lower, likely due to reduced HLA and DR expression. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the functional and functional impairment of DC in human DC function."

Through evolution, current influenza viruses develop the ability to infect people who have been vaccinated against earlier strains. New strains of influenza that infect birds and pigs could evolve to infect and spread between people, causing a global pandemic. The influenza virus lives within a human or animal host, so that viral evolution happens within, or in the spread between, individuals. As such, what happens to the virus during the course of an infection is a question of great interest. We here describe a statistical method that uses viral genome sequence data to measure how evolution affects the influenza virus within a single host. Studying data from infections transmitted between pigs, we find evidence for evolutionary adaptation in six of sixteen animals for which data were available. In one case, an immune response mounted by a pig against the virus is apparent. Our method provides a statistical framework for using sequence data to study viral evolution on very short timescales, enabling new research into within-host viral evolution.","Influenza virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we describe a method to measure the role of selection acting on influenza virus in the individual host, based on time-resolution genome sequence data from infection. We find that the haemagglutinin gene (HA1) of influenza virus is non-neutral in a total of sixteen infections. We also find evidence of positive and negative selection acting in specific alleles, cases, and data suggest the presence of time-dependent selection. We show that a non-synonymous mutation in the epitope region of the virus was initially positive, but strongly negative selection was found to be strongly negative. Our method accounts for linkage disequilibrium between nucleotides at different positions in the haemaagglutsinin genes, allowing analysis of populations of multiple mutations present at any given time. Our approach offers new insight into the dynamics of influenza infection, providing detailed characterisation of forces that underlie viral evolution."

However, there are concerns that resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), a drug currently recommended for IPTp, may increase the burden of MiP in absence of adequate prevention. In this study, we combined estimates of changing endemicity of malaria in Africa and mapped SP resistance mutations with current coverage of antenatal access to IPTP SP (IPTp-SP) in Africa. We estimated the relationship between SP resistance and the parasitological efficacy of SP in pregnancy, and estimated the incremental value of enhancing IPTb-SP uptake to match current antenatal care (ANC) coverage. We also estimated that the risks of MiPs from malaria-causing low birthweight (mLBW) and unprotected pregnancies (i.e. insecticide-treated nets [ITNs] leading to live births and mLBW deliveries) fell from 37% (33%–41% 95% credible interval [crI] to 31% (27%–34% 95%) in 2000 and 2015 in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. These gains were fragile, and coverage was far less optimal than current ANC coverage. Our analysis highlights the difficulties associated with estimating the relationship of effectiveness of interventions to parasitology and health outcomes including birthweight, and highlights the overall importance of effective preventative strategies in relationship with transmission intensity, parity, and SP resistance."

In many species, transformability is a transient property relying on a specialized membrane-associated machinery for binding exogenous double-stranded DNA and internalization of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fragments extracted from exogenous DNA. Subsequent physical integration of internalized ssDNA into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination requires dedicated cytosolic ssDNA–processing proteins. Here, we document the roles in the model transformable species Streptococcus pneumoniae of one of these processing proteins, SsbB, a paralogue of SsbA the ssDNA–binding protein essential for genome maintenance in bacteria, which is expressed uniquely in cells competent for genetic transformation. We show that SsbB is highly abundant, potentially allowing the binding of ∼1.15 Mb ssDNA (half a genome equivalent); that it participates in the processing of ssDNA into recombinants; that it protects and stabilizes internalized ssDNA; and that, at high DNA concentration, it is of crucial importance for chromosomal transformation whilst antagonizing plasmid transformation. We conclude that SsbB creates a reservoir of ssDNA, presumably allowing multiple transformations in the same cell, and that S. pneumoniae has evolved SsbB to optimize chromosomal transformation, thereby contributing to its remarkable genetic plasticity.","Bacteria encode single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein (SSB), which is crucial for genome maintenance. In Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, the alternative SSB, SsbB, is expressed uniquely in the context of genetic transformation. However, its precise role is disappointingly obscure.

We show that Ssb is highly abundant, potentially allowing binding to ∼1.15 Mb of ssDNA (half genome equivalent) and participates in the processing of the ssDNA recombinants; high DNA concentration, crucial for chromosomal transformation, and antagonizing plasmid transformation. This observation explains a long-standing observation that plasmids transformation is inefficient in both S. and pneumoniae (compared to chromosomal transformations). Furthermore, it supports a previous suggestion that SbB creates a reservoir for ssDNA, allowing successive recombination cycles."

Treatments for this disease, collectively termed invasive aspergillosis, are often not successful, and prospects for survival can be slim. A. fumigatus produces small molecules, termed siderophores, for acquisition and storage of iron, an element essential for growth. We found that these siderophores are crucial for virulence of A. fumigatus because their removal (by gene deletion) prevents or lessens disease in a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. Siderophores are not produced by humans so they present good prospects for new therapies, as drugs that specifically target siderophore production, rather than activities shared by humans and fungi, are less likely to affect patients adversely.","Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of Aspergillosis, a parasitic disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide. The pathogen is highly lethal in humans, presenting a rare opportunity to strategize therapeutically against the pathogen. We have previously demonstrated that A. fumgatus excretes fusarinine C and triacetylfusarinin C to capture extracellular iron, and uses ferricrocin hyphal iron storage. Here, we delineate the pathways of intra-extracellular siderophore biosynthesis and show that a developmentally regulated fourth siderothore, termed hydroxyferricrocidin, is employed for conidial iron storage and virulence. We also show that the inactivation of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase SidC leads to complete dependence on reductive iron assimilation and growth under iron-limited conditions, partial sensitivity to oxidative stress, and reduced virulence, despite normal germ tube formation.

In this report, we studied the timing of transcription for genes in the bacterial DNA damage repair pathway (known as the SOS response), a regulatory system where each gene is controlled by the same transcriptional repressor, LexA. By specifically isolating the role of the LexA binding interaction at SOS gene promoters, we found a relationship between the amount of DNA damage incurred by the cell, LexA binding kinetics at a promoter, and the timing of promoter activation. Our data fit a kinetic model that reveals how a disequilibrium between the LexA-operator binding reaction and cellular LexA concentrations causes timing differences between genes to emerge only at higher doses of DNA damage. Taken together, we show that non-equilibrium DNA binding kinetics is the mechanism by which a single transcription factor can modulate timing differences across an entire network of genes as a function of stimulus dose.","The DNA damage repair pathway (SOS) is one of the most important biological pathways in the world. It is controlled by a single transcription factor, the LexA repressor, which regulates the expression of multiple genes in the pathway. The mechanism by which this transcription factor regulates the timing of promoter activation and shut-network impact physiology is not well understood. In Escherichia coli, approximately 40 genes are regulated by a gene repressor called LexA. During a DNA damaging event, LexA degradation triggers SOS gene transcription, which is temporally separated into subsets of ‘early’, ‘middle’ and ‘late’ genes. This feature plays an important role in regulating SOS response, but the range of separation underlying the mechanism is experimentally defined. Here, we show that low doses of DNA damage, the timing differences emerge when higher levels of the DNA damage increase the function of the cell. We also show that a series of synthetic SOS gene promoters vary in their LexA-operator binding kinetics, which are identical to those studied during a large dose-of-range DNA damage. Our data provide insight into the remarkable feature of the SOS pathway demonstrating that a single gene transcription factor is employed to control the relative timing of gene transcription function and the stimulus dose."

Since it has been proposed that magpies play an important role in an endemic WNV cycle in human habitats in Europe, we conducted the first experimental infection of magpie with the two WNV lineages currently circulating in Europe. We observed high susceptibility of magpie to WNV infection with virus titers higher than those necessary for the successful transmission of WNV to a mosquito and often resulting in death. Likewise, we detected elevated titers of neutralizing antibodies in all the samples tested as well as the viral genome in the organs, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and feather pulps of the infected animals. Our results suggest that the magpie, which is one of the most abundant corvid species in Europe, could be a source of WNV transmission to other birds and humans, which expands the knowledge about WNV pathogenesis, transmission and ecology, that benefits monitoring and control programs.","West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic pathogen naturally transmitted from mosquitoes to natural hosts of birds, and has spread worldwide for decades.

Magpies were highly susceptible to WNV infection, with similar low survival rates (30% and 42.8%) to lineages 2 and 3. Infected magpies developed viremia, which was detectable 3 days post-infection and titers necessary for successful transmission of WNV by the mosquito. Neutralizing antibodies were detected at time points analyzed (7 and 17 days after infection). WNV was detected in the brains of the hearts of the infected animals, and in the blood of the surviving birds. These observations shed light on the pathogenesis, transmission, ecology, and how WNV may benefit the implementation of surveillance and control programs."

This mosquito-borne alphavirus primarily causes an often debilitating, acute and chronic polyarthritis/polyarthalgia. Despite robust anti-viral immune responses CHIKV is able to persist, with such persistence poorly understood and the likely cause of chronic disease. Herein we highlight the propensity of CHIKV to persist long term, both as a persistent viraemia in different B cell deficient mouse strains, but also as persistent viral RNA in wild-type mice. These studies suggest that, aside from antibodies, other immune factors, such as CD4 T cells and TNF, are active in viraemia control. The work also supports the notion that CHIKV disease, with the exception of encephalitis, is largely an immunopathology. Persistent CHIKV RNA in wild-type mice continues to stimulate type I interferon and T cell responses, with this model of chronic disease recapitulating many of the features seen in chronic CHIKV patients.","The recent epidemic of arthritogenic alphavirus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), has prompted a quest to understand the correlates of protection against virus disease in order to inform the development of new interventions. In this study, we show that persistent CHIKV infections persist in long term, persistent, steady-state, viraemias in multiple B cell deficient mouse strains, and persistent RNA (including negative-strand RNA) in wild-type mice. We demonstrate that T cells (NK cells) are required for viraemia suppression, and confirmed a role for T cells in arthritis promotion, in the absence of antibody responses. We also show that MHC class II-restricted T cells are required to produce anti-viral IgG2c responses in the presence of antibodies. These anti-Viral cytokines, TNF and IFNγ, were persistently elevated in persistently infected B T cell deficient mice, and adoptive transfer of anti-CHIKVs antibodies was unable to clear permanently and permanently infected B cells deficient, mice. These studies suggest that chronic arthritic disease is a consequence of persistent, replicating transcriptionally active CHIKVs RNA."

Computational models that can predict the effect of a new combination of drugs without having to test it experimentally can help in accelerating this process. In particular, network-based dynamic models of these pathways hold promise to both understand and predict the effect of therapeutics. However, their use is currently hampered by limitations in our knowledge of the underlying biochemistry, as well as in the experimental and computational technologies used for calibrating the models. Thus, the results from such models need to be carefully interpreted and used in order to avoid biased predictions. Here we present a procedure that deals with this uncertainty by using experimental data to build an ensemble of dynamic models. The method incorporates steps to reduce overfitting and maximize predictive capability. We find that by combining the outputs of individual models in an ensemble it is possible to obtain a more robust prediction. We report results obtained with this method, which we call SELDOM (enSEmbLe of Dynamic lOgic-based Models), showing that it improves the predictions previously reported for several challenging problems.","In this work, we present a method called SELDOM (EnSEmbLe Dynamic lOgic-based Models) that builds ensemble logic-based dynamic models, trains experimental data, and combines individual simulations with ensemble prediction. We show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for predicting the effect of novel perturbations, which are considered model training. The problem is ill- posed by the nonlinear nature of systems, the fact that only a fraction of the proteins involved in post-translational modifications are measured, and limitations in technologies growing cells in vitro, perturbing, and measuring variations in variations. To overcome these issues, we have developed a methodology called SELOM ( enSEmble Dynamic LOgics-Based Models), which builds ensemble and logic-driven dynamic models. We also build ensemble and model reduction steps to prune spurious interactions and to mitigate overfitting. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to a number of experimental silico signal transduction case-study, including the recent HPN-DREAM breast cancer challenge. Our results show that SELDom is highly competitive compared to state-to-state methods for the purpose of recovering network topology. Importantly, the utility of this approach goes beyond basic network inference (i.e. uncovering static interaction networks) and builds dynamic (based on an ordinary differential equation) models, mechanistic interpretations and reliable dynamic predictions for new experimental conditions."

Most studies of dynamic gain have focused on neurons without intrinsic degrees of freedom exhibiting integrator-type subthreshold dynamics. Many neuron types in the brain, however, exhibit complex subthreshold dynamics such as resonance, found for instance in cortical interneurons, stellate cells, and mitral cells. A resonator neuron has at least two degrees of freedom for which the classical Fokker-Planck approach to calculating the dynamic gain is largely intractable. Here, we lift the voltage-reset rule after a spike, allowing us to derive a complete expression of the dynamic gain of a resonator neuron model. We find the gain can exhibit only six shapes. The resonant ones have peaks that become large due to intrinsic adaptation and become sharp due to an intrinsic frequency. A resonance can nevertheless result from either property. The analysis presented here helps explain how intrinsic neuron dynamics shape population-level response properties and provides a powerful tool for developing theories of inter-neuron correlations and dynamic responses of neural populations.","The response to neuronal population space inputs depends on the intrinsic properties of constituent neurons. The main modes of single neuron dynamics –integration resonance and resonance – are distinguished from each other. Resonator cell types exist in a variety of brain areas, but their models incorporate a feature that has fewer investigated effects. To understand better how resonator frequency preference emerges from intrinsic dynamics and contributes to local area population firing rate dynamics, we have developed a dynamic gain analytically solvable-degree freedom neuron model. The Fokker-Planck approach, however, is intractable. The alternative Gauss-Rice approach lifts the resetting voltage spike and allows us to derive the complete expression of dynamic gain in the resonator neuron model in terms of cascade filters of input. We find that resonance arises primarily from slow adaptation to intrinsic frequency acting to sharpen the location of the resonant peak. We determine parameter regions of existence of intrinsic frequency subthreshold spiking resonance, finding possible intersections. The expressions analysis presented here provide an account of how intrinsic neuron dynamics shape dynamic population response properties and facilitate the construction of the exact theory of correlations between stability and population activity in networks containing populations of resonator neurons."

Although tick-borne pathogens are transmitted by vertebrate hosts through saliva and blood feeding, tick salivary gland (SG) factors are not likely to be implicated in transmission. In order to identify tick factors, we characterized the transcriptome of female I. ricinus SGs using generation sequencing techniques, compared transcriptomes of Bartonella henselae-infected and non-infectious ticks. High-throughput sequencing of SG transcriptomes led to generation of 24,539 isotigs and 829 and 517 transcripts that were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated respectively, in response to bacterial infection. Searches based on sequence identity showed differentially expressed transcripts, 161 transcripts corresponded to groups previously annotated by tick SG gene families, and 161 genes had unknown function. Expression patterns were selected for genes belonging to the BPTI/Kunitz family serine protease inhibitors, the salp15 super-family, and the arthropod defensin family, and were validated by qRT-PCR. IrSPI, a member of the BPPI/ Kunitz family of serine and protease inhibitor, showed the highest-regulation of SGs in the response to infection. We conclude that IrspI silencing impaired tick feeding, resulted in reduced bacterial load in tick SGs."

Structural classification schemes focus on the assignment and organisation of protein domains into folds. However, they do not suggest how different folds might relate to one another in a global way. We introduce the concept of bridges through fold space: significant similarities between these units. We consider four alignment methods and a dynamic approach to placing these bridges. A greater consensus between these methods cannot be achieved by simply increasing the stringency with which edges are assigned. Instead, we emphasise the importance of considering consensus maps and only report results where there is agreement across all networks. It is possible that a study of the bridges may reveal evolutionary relationships. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of structures, we find that bridges consistently fall between folds which evolved at similar times. Moreover, the landscapes all consist of a core of older folds, with younger structures more often seen at the periphery. Finally we identify four pivotal folds in the landscapes. They contain topological motifs which unite disparate regions of fold space.","The protein structure classification schemes exist to partition the protein universe into structural units called folds. The schemes discuss how these units sit relative to the global structure space. In this paper we construct networks to describe the global relationships between folds and form structural bridges. We generate networks using different structural alignment methods and multiple score thresholds. We find that networks constructed by different methods remain similar distance apart regardless of the probability threshold defining a structural bridge. We suggest that structural bridges method is a specific attempt to build a picture of structural space reliant on a single structural superposition method. Despite differences in representations, we agree that the organisation of fold space is principal community structures:- α,-β sandwiches, -β barrels, α/β and α+ β. We also find that fold ages in networks are associated with higher age differences between bridged folds, and that the difference increases the number of networks displaying the edge. Our findings suggest that evolutionary information encoded by structural bridges may be encoded in structural structures. Finally, we identify highly central pivotal folds representing dominant topological features that act as key attractors to landscapes."

To survive in the phagosome, Leishmania employs surface-bound glycoconjugates such as the GP63 metalloprotease and lipophosphoglycan to subvert the phagosome’s microbicidal potential. In particular, GP63 cleaves host cell vesicle fusion molecules that regulate phagosomal processes ranging from antigen cross-presentation to cytokine secretion. Unlike apicomplexan parasites and bacteria, Leishmania does not inject its virulence-associated glycoconjugates across the phagosome membrane. We found that post-phagocytosis, Leishmania co-opts the host cell secretory pathway to promote the egress of its virulence factors out of the phagosome. Importantly, chemical and genetic inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport hindered the redistribution of GP63 and lipophosphoglycan, thereby impeding the cleavage of GP63 target Synaptotagmin XI. Notably, knockdown ER/ERGIC-resident membrane fusion regulators Sec22b and syntaxin-5 revealed that these host molecules were essential to the phagosomal egress of Leishmania virulence factors. These findings provide new insight into how Leishmania sabotages the host cell endomembrane system for its own benefit.","Leishmania is a protozoan pathogen that infects millions of people worldwide. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogen is transmitted to humans via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of macrophages, where it infects the host cell. The ER-Golgi is an important host cell secretory pathway that allows the parasite to escape from the ER. However, the mechanism by which the parasite escapes from ER Golgi is poorly understood. Here, we show that lipophosphoglycan GP63 is released onto the parasite surface following phagocytosis and that it is released to redistribute the ER-golgi to macrophage. We also show that the parasite is able to escape the ER via the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and that this process is mediated by host proteins and components of the machinery that mediates the spreading of Leishmania effectors to host cells. Our findings reveal a mechanism in which the vacuolar pathogen takes advantage of a host cell-secretory pathway to promote the egress of virulence factors from the PV."

When Mastl is deleted, cells progress through mitosis with missegregated chromosomes, which become unraveled. However, the molecular mechansims by which Mastl promotes proper chromosome segregation and mitotic progression remain elusive. In this study, we show that the Cdk1->Greatwall kinase/Mastl->PP2A pathway plays a central role in regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) by preventing premature SAC silencing. We further demonstrate that Mastl is required for multi-site phosphorylation of the essntial SAC protein MPS1 as well as robust MPS1 kinase activity in mitosis by inhibiting PP2A/B55-mediated MPS1 dephosphorylation.

The genes regulating this attachment are poorly understood. This is especially true in the head where mesoderm and neural crest cells generate muscle and tendon, respectively. We show that the gene cyp26b1 is critical for muscle tendon attachment in a specific region of the developing head. The movement of tendon generating cells into mature tendons requires cyp26b1. Loss of cyp26b1 disrupts these movements and muscles subsequently extend into inappropriate areas. Cyp26b1 appears to be required in neural crest cells but not the tendon generating cells. Collectively, our work provides insight into the genetic and cellular mechanisms that attach muscle and tendon.","The vertebrate musculoskeletal system is composed of a variety of tissues, including muscle, tendon, and skeleton. The mechanisms by which these tissues integrate into each other are poorly understood. In this study, we used a forward genetic screen to identify cyp26b1, a gene that is critical for the integration of muscles and tendons in the vertebrate head, neural crest cells, cranial tendons, and limb trunk tissue. We found that cyp 26b1 is required for the proper integration of the ventral and pharyngeal arches, particularly the mandibulohyoid junction where the second arch muscles and the first arch muscles interconnect. Using time-lapse confocal analyses, we show that the expression of this gene is restricted to a short time window that overlaps with the dynamic window of tenoblast condensation. Our results suggest that degradation of RA by a previously undescribed population may be critical for condensation of adjacent scxa-expressing tenoblasts."

Cost-effective deployment requires understanding complex connections between rabies risk and healthcare seeking behavior. During 1995–2005, there was a rapid decline in dog and human rabies cases in several Latin American countries following concerted investment in mass dog vaccinations and human post-exposure vaccination. Using data from this period, we econometrically estimate relationships between dog vaccinations, dog rabies cases, human exposure reports, human post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use, and human rabies deaths. We estimate quantitatively how dog vaccinations indirectly reduce human rabies deaths, mediated through dog rabies cases, dog bite reporting, and PEP use. We find that reported human exposures decline as dog rabies cases decline, but these declines are offset by increases in reported exposures per dog rabies case, which may be driven by increased rabies awareness through anti-rabies campaigns. Furthermore, while PEP demand declines as dog rabies cases decline, increases in income and public health expenditures concurrently increase demand for PEP. These findings provide better understanding of the underlying factors driving PEP demand and exposure (under)reporting to inform cost-effective policy design to reduce unnecessary PEP prescription and false negatives leading to human death.","The World Health Organization, World Organization for Animal Health, and Food and Agriculture Organization resolved to eliminate human rabies deaths by 2030, and the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) added human and dog rabies vaccines investments in 2021–2025.

Multiple epidemiological studies indicate that women who take hormone replacement therapy, estrogen or estrogen with progesterone, peri- or postmenopause will have an increased chance of developing ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, the five-year survival rate after diagnosis is very low indicating that better tools are needed to diagnose and treat ovarian cancer. The models that would allow investigation of this disease are severely limited. In this article we introduce a mouse model that develops epithelial ovarian tumors, and by employing inhibitors of estrogen synthesis, we show that ovarian tumorigenesis in this model is dependent on estrogen production within the ovarian tumor. These studies suggest that estrogen may play a role in promoting ovarian tumor growth.","Ovarian epithelial cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer in women and men. The development of ovarian epithelial tumors is poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of an appropriate experimental model for studying the onset and progression of the disease. In this study, we created a mutant mouse model of aberrant estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) signaling in the hypothalamic-pituitary- ovarian axis, which leads to ovarian tumorigenesis. The mice, termed ERαd/d, were conditionally deleted from the anterior pituitary, but remained intact in their hypothalamus and ovary. Loss of negative- feedback regulation of estrogen (E) level in the pituitaries led to increased production of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the ovarian tissue. Hyperstimulation of ovarian cells with LH resulted in elevated steroidogenesis, producing high circulating levels of steroid hormones, including E. In response to elevated levels of E, ERα-dependent gene expression, abnormal cell proliferation, and tumorigenigenesis were observed. Consistent with our findings, treatment with the treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with letrozole, a benzodiazepine inhibitor, markedly reduced circulating E in ovarian tumor volume. Thus, this unique animal model, which serves as a useful tool for exploring the involvement of E-dependent signaling pathways in ovarian epithelia."

Indirect evidence suggests that this behaviour is, in part, instructed by hormones produced by the foetally derived placenta. We previously reported that the Phlda2 gene controls the size of the placental endocrine compartment that produces hormones. Phlda2 is subject to the remarkable epigenetic process called genomic imprinting, in which one parental allele is switched off. In the case of Phlda2, this is the paternal allele. This raises the intriguing possibility that the father’s genome influences the quality of care that offspring receive from their mothers. Here, we show via genetic manipulation of pup embryos that female mice pregnant with pups carrying the highest dose of Phlda2 favour nest building over caring for their young or themselves. In contrast, dams exposed to the lowest Phlda2 dose while pregnant prioritise nurturing and grooming of their young and personal grooming. These changes in maternal focus suggest the possibility that imprinting of Phlda2 contributed to enhanced maternal care in mammals. This study also presents a unique example of how the genetic makeup of offspring can influence maternal behaviour.","Maternal care is essential for the survival and lifelong health of offspring. In mammals, the mother is the primary caregiver and is programmed to produce the hormones produced during pregnancy. High-quality maternal care has been shown to be essential for survival, lifelong health, and offspring. However, it has been previously shown that the paternally silenced imprinted gene pleckstrin homology-like domain family member 2 (Phlda2) functions to negatively regulate a single lineage of mouse placenta called the spongiotrophoblast, a major source of hormones during pregnancy and during the life cycle of the mother. Here, we show that the offspring of mice exposed to different doses of the maternally expressed Phlda2 gene—active alleles, active allele (ex extant state) and loss of function— exhibit changes in the maternal hypothalamus and hippocampus during pregnancy, regions important for maternal-care behaviour. We also show that offspring exposed to the highest Phlda 2 dose exhibit decreased nursing and grooming of pups, and increased focus on nest building. These findings suggest that imprinting of the gene may have contributed to increased maternal care in mammals."

Folding of globular proteins entails a similar discrimination. To gain physical insight, we computed the binding affinities of helical structures of the protein Im9 in various native or nonnative configurations by atomic simulations, discovering that partial packing of the Im9 core is frustrated. This frustration is overcome when the entire core of the protein is assembled, consistent with experiment indicating no significant kinetic trapping in Im9 folding. Our systematic analysis thus reveals a subtle, contextual aspect of biomolecular recognition and provides a general approach to characterize folding frustration.","Biomolecular recognition entails attractive forces of functional and functional states that discriminate between potential nonnative interactions and favor alternate stable configurations. The challenge posed by competition between nonnative and native-centric forces has been conceptualized as frustration. Experimentally, we show that frustration is minimal in evolved biological systems where nonnative possibilities are intuitively abundant. However, the physical basis of minimal frustration in protein folding remains poorly elucidated. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to assess the energetic favorability of nonnative versus native interactions. We compute free energies of the combinations of helices of Im9 (also referred to as H1, H2, H3, H4) using extensive explicit-water molecular dynamics simulation (total simulated time > 300 μs). Frustration detected in H1-H2 packing and nonnative packing orientation was significantly stabilized relative to native, and a prominent nonnative effect was observed in H3 loop residues surrounding H4. Taken together, our results highlight the contextual nature of molecular recognition, and suggest that nonnative effects of H1 and H2 packing are largely avoided by experimentally inferred Im9 folding transition from the transition state to the native packing."

Most models used to predict mosquito-borne disease transmission incorporate climate data collected at coarser scales than mosquitoes typically experience. Climate conditions can vary greatly between indoor and outdoor environments, and are influenced by landscape features. We conducted a field experiment with the Asian tiger mosquito to explore how microclimate variation across an urban landscape affects mosquito life history and potential to transmit arboviruses, like dengue. We demonstrate that climate conditions captured by weather stations do not reflect relevant mosquito microclimate, and that subtle variation in mean and diurnal ranges of temperature and relative humidity can lead to appreciable variation in key mosquito / pathogen traits that are important for transmission. Our results have implications for statistical and mechanistic models used to predict variation in transmission across seasons, regions, and land uses, but also for building in realistic environmental variation in laboratory work on mosquito-pathogen interactions. Finally, the variation in microclimate we observed across land use was subtle; likely because our study site is a relatively small city. Nevertheless, these translated into considerable differences in mosquito traits and dengue transmission potential, suggesting these effects could be much larger in more expansive cities.","Aedes albopictus is the causative agent of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The mosquito microclimate can vary greatly between indoor and outdoor environments, influenced by strongly variation in landscape features. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-concept study in the vicinity of the University of Georgia to explore the effects of fine-scale microclimate variation on mosquito life history and vectorial capacity (VC). We placed Ae. alboplictus larvae in artificial pots distributed to replicate sites in different land uses – urban, suburban, and rural, characterized by high, intermediate, and low proportions of impervious surfaces. Data loggers placed in the larval environment and nearby vegetation record daily variation in water ambient temperature and relative humidity. The number of adults emerging from the pot and body size and sex were recorded daily. We found that mosquito microenvironment can significantly vary seasonally depending on land use. Urban sites were generally warmer and more humid than suburban and rural sites, translating to decreased larval survival, smaller body sizes, and lower capita growth rates of mosquitoes in urban sites. Dengue transmission potential was predicted to be higher in the summer than in the fall. Additionally, the effect of land use on vectorial potential varied seasonally. Warm summers resulted in higher predicted VC in both rural and urban sites, while warmer, urban sites were higher predicted in the cooler fall season."

The smallest capsid protein (SCP) – only 8 kDa molecular mass as compared to the 155 kDa major capsid protein – has been demonstrated to be essential for HCMV growth, but is dispensable in herpes simplex virus type 1. These seemingly contradictory observations have been a paradox. Here, we solve this paradox by high resolution cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM), in conjunction with functional studies using ribozyme inhibition. Our structural comparisons of HCMV virion and capsid reveal molecular interactions at the secondary structure level and suggest that SCP might contribute to capsid binding of pp150, an essential, cytomegalovirus-specific tegument protein. SCP-deficient particles generated by ribozyme inhibition of SCP-expression in HCMV-infected cells show no pp150 tegument density, demonstrating that SCP is required for the functional binding of pp150 to the capsid. Our results suggest that SCP recruits pp150 to stabilize the HCMV nucleocapsid to enable encapsidation of the genome, which is more densely packaged in HCMV than in other herpesviruses. Overall, this study not only resolves the above paradox, but also illustrates the passive acquisition of a new, essential function by SCP in the production of infectious HCMV virions.","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that causes birth defects in newborns and life-threatening complications in immunocompromised individuals. Unlike other human herpesviruses, HCMV contains a larger dsDNA genome and a similarly-sized capsid. However, little is known about how pp150, a tegument protein found in many cytomegaviruses, is required to stabilize the genome-containing capsid and stabilize viral replication. Here, we show that the smallest capsid protein (SCP), dispensable for herpes simplex virus type 1, can play an essential, undefined, role in HCMVs infection. Using cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM), we determine the three-dimensional structures of the HCMV capsid (pp150) and virion (p150) at sub-nanometer resolution. Comparison of structures reveals that pp150 is composed of helix bundles connected to a long central helix. Correlation of resolved helices and sequence-based secondary structure prediction maps the teguments density to the N-terminal half of pp150. These structures demonstrate that the SCP mediates interactions between the capsid with pp150 and the upper helix bundle."

We are interested in understanding the fundamental processes of how gene expression dynamics within each cell is coupled to the mechanical forces between cells, such that cells move to take up their positions as part of different tissues depending on the genes they express. Recent experiments which track single cell movement and division in conjunction with their gene expression dynamics suggest various hypotheses as to how this coupling functions to pattern the embryo. We have developed a computational model which can test these hypotheses. The model consists of dividing cells, interacting with each other through mechanical forces, within a confinement of embryo boundary. Each cell contains a genetic network of specific genes which influence cell adhesion properties and cell division plane directions. We explicitly simulate the formation of the trophectoderm and endoderm layers of cells which illuminates the principles by which the embryo is robustly patterned.","Mammalian embryogenesis is a dynamic process involving gene expression and mechanical forces in proliferating cells. The exact nature of these interactions, and the lineage patterning of the trophectoderm and endoderm tissues, is a subject of debate. We developed a computational modeling framework to study the process, combined with the effects of mechanical and genetic interactions, in the context of proliferating cell types. We demonstrate that perpendicular alignment of animal-vegetable (v) and embryonic-embryonic (eb-ab) axes result in minimizing the total elastic conformational energy of the entire collection of cells, constrained by the zona pellucida. We show that coupling of gene expression mechanics and cell movement is important for the formation of a trophetoderm endodrom. We compare quantitatively and quantitatively hypotheses: (1) position determines gene expression, (2) gene expression determines position, and (3) gene adhesion determines position. Our model, which couples gene expression with cell-based spatial mechanical simulations of genetic networks, provides a means to test hypotheses that are controlled in a silico environment."

In contrast to a single viral lineage spreading across this country, a phylogenetic analysis of the whole-genome sequences of more than 300 influenza A viruses of the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes sampled from the 2006–2007 epidemic season reveals that multiple phenotypically and antigenically distinct viral lineages of entered and co-circulated in the US during this time. Furthermore, the widespread co-circulation of multiple lineages, even in geographically remote localities, allowed for frequent reassortment between influenza A viruses of the same subtype. Through reassortment, a minor lineage of A/H3N2 viruses surprisingly re-acquired sensitivity to the adamantane class of antiviral drugs, and a new A/H1N1 antigenic variant emerged that later became globally dominant. In sum, these results highlight the complexity of the spread of influenza A virus in time and space, and highlight the need for intensified global surveillance involving whole-genome sequence data.","The 2006–2007 influenza season was the largest ever observed in the United States, with a total of 284/H1N1 and 69/H3N2 viruses collected from the continental United States during the season. In this study, we examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of the virus during this season. We found that multiple clades of influenza virus entered the co-circulation during this period, and that these clades exchanged genome segments for reassortment, producing a minor clade of viruses that appears to be globally dominant. Overall, we found that co-conversion of multiple viral clades during the 2006–07 epidemic season revealed patterns of spatial spread far more complex than previously observed. This suggests a major role for migration and reassortment shaping the epidemiological dynamics of human influenza virus."

The latter organelles are hair-like cellular appendages implicated in cell and fluid motility, sensing and transducing information from their environment, and development. Their biogenesis and maintenance depends on a kinesin- and dynein-mediated motility process termed intraflagellar transport (IFT). In addition to comprising these specialized molecular motors, the IFT machinery consists of large multisubunit complexes whose exact composition and organization has not been fully defined. Here we identify a protein, DYF-11/MIP-T3, that is conserved in all ciliated organisms and is associated with IFT in C. elegans. Disruption of C. elegans DYF-11 results in structurally compromised cilia, likely as a result of IFT motor and subunit misassembly. Animals lacking DYF-11 display chemosensory anomalies, consistent with a role for the protein in cilia-associated sensory processes. In zebrafish, MIP-T3 is essential for gastrulation movements during development, similar to that observed for other ciliary components, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins. In conclusion, we have identified a novel IFT machinery component that is also essential for development in vertebrates.","MIP-T3 is a human protein found to associate microtubules with the kinesin- interacting neuronal protein DISC1 (Disrupted--Schizophrenia 1). However, its cellular function(s) remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the C. elegans MIP-t3 ortholog DYF-11 intraflagellar transport (IFFT) protein plays a critical role in assembling functional kinesins motor-IFT particle complexes. We cloned the loss of function of dyf-11 mutant key components of IFT machinery, including Kinesin II, IFT subcomplex B proteins, fail to enter ciliary axonemes and/or mislocalize, resulting in compromised ciliary structures and sensory functions, and abnormal lipid accumulation. Analyses of different mutant backgrounds suggest that DYFs-11 functions as a novel component of the IFT-subcomplex B protein. Consistent with an evolutionarily conserved cilia-associated role, mammalian MIP -T3 localizes to the basal bodies of cilia, and zebrafish mipt3 functions synergistically with Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein Bbs4 to ensure proper gastrulation, a key cilium- and basal body-dependent developmental process. Our findings implicate MIP–T3 as a previously unknown and critical role for ciliary biogenesis and highlight an emerging role for the organelle in vertebrate development."

Each unit of the repeat contains a copy of the primate-specific DUX4 retrogene, encoding a germline transcription factor that is repressed in somatic tissue. In FSHD, somatic repression of the DUX4 gene is compromised, leading to a variegated expression pattern of DUX4 in muscle cells. The complex (epi)genetic etiology of FSHD has long hampered the generation of a faithful animal model, and thus far the role of FSHD candidate genes has only been studied in model organisms by overexpression approaches. Here we present two transgenic mouse models containing either patient- or control-sized D4Z4 repeats. In our mice, the regulation of the FSHD locus is preserved in both lines, and only in the disease model somatic derepression and variegated expression of DUX4 is observed. These mice thus reflect many aspects of the complex regulation of DUX4 expression in humans. These models may therefore become valuable tools in understanding the in vivo regulation and function of DUX4, its role in FSHD, and the evaluation of therapeutic strategies.","Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystroke caused by decreased epigenetic repression of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding the germline transcription factor encoded by the repeat. Unaffected individuals generally have 10 repeats arrayed in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4, whereas the common form of FSHD is caused by a contraction of an array of fewer than 10 repeats, which is associated with decreased epigenetics repression of the variegated expression of the transcription factor. In this study, we generated transgenic mice carrying the D4D1 allele and the control allele. We recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX 4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high and low levels of germline, ( incomplete) epigenetic, and somatic repression of somatic tissue. In addition, we show that the mouse muscle cells are able to activate similar functional gene groups in mouse muscle and human muscle cells. Our results provide a valuable animal model of F SHD and a useful resource to study the molecular mechanisms underlying FSHDs and test new therapeutic intervention strategies."

They are produced in the presence of infectious agents at body surfaces exposed to the environment. Increasingly, their functional repertoire is expanding, and they have been shown to modulate the immune system. In humans, there is a block of six β-defensin genes that varies in copy number in the population. Individuals with an increased number of β-defensin genes have an increased likelihood of developing the skin autoimmune disease psoriasis. It is not known how this increase in gene copy number influences development of the disease, and psoriasis is a complex interplay of genomic and environmental factors that trigger disease progression and include exposure to viruses. We examined whether a molecular pattern characteristic of viruses produces an altered immune response in the presence of the defensin human β-defensin 3 (hBD3). We find that hBD3 triggers a larger interferon defence response to this viral mimic by increasing accessibility to a cellular receptor that recognises viral patterns. Interferon is known to be important in autoimmunity and our work may explain why individuals with increased β-defensin number are predisposed to develop psoriasis.","Human β-defensin 3 (hBD3) is a cationic host defence peptide that is a highly copy number variable gene that is associated with autoimmune disease and psoriasis. HBD3 has been shown to influence the immune response to viral infection, but its increased copy number is not associated with the autoimmune disease. We investigated the effect of hBD3 on the response to the viral ligand polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) in human mouse primary cells. We found that the presence of polyI :C co-localises to the early endosome, suggesting that the absence of PolyI: C may have a significant phenotypic effect on response to infection and development of autoimmunity in humans."

Mtb has to adapt its metabolic needs to the nutritional environment in the host. We investigated the role of glucose phosphorylation and discovered that Mtb expresses two functional glucokinases. Using 13C-tracing experiments we demonstrated that both enzymes are competent to incorporate glucose into central carbon metabolism. In agreement with the view that Mtb metabolizes fatty acids to grow in vivo, both enzymes were dispensable for Mtb replication in mouse lungs and spleens. Surprisingly, however, the glucokinase double mutant was attenuated during the chronic phase of mouse infections. These studies suggest that Mtb metabolizes glucose in vivo and that its survival in chronically infected mice depends on glucose phosphorylation.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is thought to preferentially rely on fatty acid metabolism to establish and maintain chronic infections. This metabolic network, however, allows efficient co-catabolism of multiple carbon substrates. To gain insight into the importance of carbohydrate substrates in Mtb pathogenesis, we evaluated the role of glucose phosphorylation, a reaction of glycolysis and glycolyssis. We discovered that Mtb expresses functional glucokinases. Mtb is required for polyphosphate glucokinase PPGK and normal growth of glucose, but a second glucokin enzyme GLKA is dispensable. Our 13C-based metabolomic profiling revealed enzymes capable of incorporating glucose into Mtb central carbon metabolism, with PPGA serving as the dominant glucokinome in wild type (wt) Mtb. We also discovered that glucokin enzymes are required for the growth of Mtb in the lungs, and that MtB is unable to use external glucose substrates for growth metabolism. These results suggest that Mtbs may rely on glucose for its survival in chronic infection in mice."

Comparative genomic analysis of AIV data revealed that the high prevalence of Charadriiformes infected in Delaware Bay is a reservoir of AIV that is phylogenetically distinct from AIV sampled from most North American Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta are representative of the remaining AIV diversity sampled across North America. While AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, our large-scale analysis showed that this population genetic structure was transient and the long-term persistence of AIV was independent of bird flyways. These results suggest an introduced virus lineage may initially be restricted to one flyway, but migration to a major congregation site such as Alberta could occur followed by subsequent spread across flyways. These generalized predictions for virus movement will be critical to assess the associated risk for widespread diffusion and inform surveillance for pandemic preparedness.","Wild birds have been implicated in the emergence of human livestock influenza virus (HIV) in recent years. However, successful prediction of viral spread and disease emergence is hampered by a critical lack of knowledge of viral movements and the subsequent risk posed by wild bird viruses. Here, we analyze genomic data from 287 newly sequenced avian influenza virus samples isolated over a 34-year period of continuous systematic surveillance of North American migratory birds. We use a Bayesian statistical framework to test hypotheses about viral migration, population structure and patterns of genetic reassortment. Our results reveal that despite high prevalence of Charadriiformes in the Delaware Bay host population, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes from Alberta are representative of AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseridae. AIV restricted to specific migratory flyways within a short time frame, and large-scale analysis showed long-term persistence of the virus in independent bird flyways and migration populations in North America.

It has long been known that they are highly variable and that this variation is associated with differential risk for autoimmune and infectious diseases. Variant frequencies differ substantially between and even within continents. Determining HLA genotypes is thus an important part of many studies to understand the genetic basis of disease risk. However, conventional methods for HLA typing (e.g. targeted sequencing, hybridisation, amplification) are typically laborious and expensive. We have developed a method for inferring an individual's HLA genotype based on evaluating genetic information from nearby variable sites that are more easily assayed, which aims to integrate heterogeneous data. We introduce two key innovations: we allow for single HLA types to appear on heterogeneous backgrounds of genetic information and we take into account the possibility of genotyping error, which is common within the HLA region. We show that the method is well-suited to deal with multi-population datasets: it enables integrated HLA type inference for individuals of differing ancestry and ethnicity. It will therefore prove useful particularly in international collaborations to better understand disease risks, where samples are drawn from multiple countries.","MHC is a disease that affects millions of people in the developing world. In this study, we present a computational model of the HLA region, HLA-DPB1 and DRB3-5, which can be used in genotyping chips.

Prior studies have identified a unique CD4+ T-cell population that can relay signals from the sympathetic nervous system. These specialized T-cells express the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and produce acetylcholine (ACh). Release of ACh in response to neurotransmitters from the sympathetic innervation was previously shown to aberrant immune cell activation, reducing mortality during septic shock. Also, these CD4+ ChAT+ T-cells were previously found to control host-commensal interactions in naïve mice, but their role during enteric bacterial infection was unknown. Here we demonstrate that infection with C. rodentium induces ChAT+ T-cell recruitment and that expression of ChAT by this T-cell population significantly augments host defenses. These data support a diverse and expanding role of ACh in host immune responses.","Citrobacter rodentium is a pathogen that infects humans and animals and is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. It has been shown that the nervous system neurotransmitter acetylcholine plays an integral role in host defense against enteric bacterial pathogens.

We show that acetylecholine is produced by T-cells that exclusively belong to the Th subset and are able to produce IFNγ, IL-17A, and IL-22. In addition, we show that T-cell production is enhanced after C. rodentsium infection, and that this effect is associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and epithelial expression of antimicrobial peptides, compared to WT mice.

External perturbations, such as ligand binding to a local region, may trigger a global response of the protein, manifested as perturbations in positions or mobility of atoms. Here we introduce a frequency response technique, in which a local periodic perturbation is employed on a flexible loop of a protein, and atomic responses are analyzed. Protein response characteristics are found to be closely related to perturbation frequency, so frequency analysis tools such as power spectral densities and magnitude Bode plots are utilized. Conformational change of the protein estimated by this method is found to be consistent with that determined from crystal structures. We cluster the phase angles of side-chains dihedral angles to identify collectively fluctuating residues, and determine a large number of hydrophobic interactions, which help intraprotein signal propagation. We believe that the suggested frequency response technique will be a fine contribution to the existing repertoire of perturbation methods.","Signals created by local perturbations are known to propagate long distances across proteins backbone connectivity and nonbonded interactions. In this study, we investigated the propagation of a flexible ligand binding loop at the rest of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) using a variety of frequency response techniques. Using the restrained Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD) potential of WPD R loops, we found that PTP1A is driven by crystal structure conformations at different frequencies. Propagation of a local and perturbation signal manifested peaks at the fundamental frequency of upper harmonics 1/f distributed by atomic variables, Cα atoms, dihedral angles, and polar interaction distances. We found that the amplitude of the propagating signal was higher than the contribution of the transduction-chains to the dissipation of signals. Using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) TMD simulation trajectories, 16 cycles of conformational transitions between periods 1.2 and 5 ns yielded Cα displacements consistent with the crystal structures. Identification of perturbed atomic variables by statistical t-tests and log-log scale spectral densities revealed the extent of signal propagation at PTP 1B, phase angles and the trajectories of fundamental frequency cluster collectively fluctuating elements. Hydrophobic interactions were found to have a higher contribution to signal transduction and chains compared to the role of polar interactions. The high identity of the PTP domains, located in a wide region of the protein including the allosteric site, suggests that this technique may find wide applications in the identification of signaling pathways in different proteins."

SFPEL-LPI makes use of lncRNA sequences, protein sequences and known lncRNA-protein associations to extract features and calculate similarities for lncRNAs and proteins, and then combines them with a feature projection ensemble learning frame. SFPEL-LPI can predict unobserved interactions between lncRNAs and proteins, and also can make predictions for new lncRNAs (or proteins), which have no interactions with any proteins (or lncRNAs). SFPEL-LPI produces high-accuracy performances on the benchmark dataset when evaluated by five-fold cross validation, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

These ablations are linked to functionally relevant neurons, suggesting potential candidates for in vivo investigation.

In this study we determined the crystal structure of the HBGA-binding interface of the first Lewis-binder (VA207, GII.9) and compared it with those of the two secretor binders. VA207 binds to the Lewis antigens via the Lewis epitope (α-1, 3 fucose) as the major interacting residue, which is distinct from the two secretor binders that interact with the secretor antigens through the A or H epitope as a major interacting residue. In addition, precursor saccharide was involved in binding and has a role in strain-specificity of VA207. VA207 shares a conserved HBGA binding interfaces with VA387, suggesting a strong selection of human HBGAs in norovirus evolution.

In the poliovirus vaccine, recombination is one potential mode of failure where vaccine strains recombine to produce a pathogenic product. We combine gene synthesis and deep sequencing to generate a high-resolution recombination map of poliovirus, both as a model RNA virus and a continuing threat that has yet to be eradicated. This map shows that recombination is concentrated into hotspots and suggests that predictable and alterable motifs in the RNA sequence are associated with recombination frequency. We demonstrate the utility of these observations by re-designing a poliovirus strain to recombine more frequently than normal, facilitating future studies on the role of viral recombination during infection. This result suggests that a large-scale redesign of the entire poliovirus genome to dampen recombination may be feasible, with implications for producing safer and more stable live vaccines.","The control of communicable disease is directly impacted by genetic mutability and underlying etiological agents.

Here, we utilize gene synthesis and deep sequencing to create a detailed recombination map of the poliovirus 1 coding region. We identified 50 thousand breakpoints in the genome, with the majority of these breakpoints concentrated in a small number of specific “hotspots,” including associated with known predicted RNA secondary structures. Nucleotide base composition was found to be associated with recombination frequency, suggesting that recombination modulates the genome to generate predictable alterable motifs.

However, the ability to constantly and rapidly evolve may be selectively adaptive in pathogens due to the constantly changing environment created by the vertebrate immune response. The Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, evades immune detection through a system consisting of numerous unexpressed ‘cassette’ sequences that alter the expressed protein via recombination. Importantly, the potential for evolutionary change in the expressed protein, and thus its ability to repeatedly escape a directed immune response, is correlated with the diversity among the cassettes. We analyzed genetic data from diverse B. burgdorferi strains to test the hypothesis that natural selection favors diversity among the unexpressed cassettes in order to promote evolvability. The data provide significant evidence of natural selection acting to increase among-cassette diversity, but only in regions that are targeted by immune antibodies when expressed. Further, these antigenically-important regions contain mutation-prone DNA sequence structures that are conserved despite high levels of sequence divergence among strains. The empirical evidence of selection favoring mutation-prone sequences and favoring among-cassette diversity supports the hypothesis that natural selection can shape the evolvability of populations.","Antigenic variation mechanisms in microbial pathogens provide an experimentally tractable system to test natural selection favored mechanisms to increase evolvability. The antigenic variation systems consist of paralogous unexpressed ‘cassettes’ that recombine at the expression site and rapidly alter the expressed protein. Importantly, the magnitude of antigenic change in function and genetic diversity of unexpressed cassettes is direct evidence that natural selection promotes antigenic adaptation. The Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, a model test for prediction of natural selection favors amino acid diversity in unexpressed vls cassettes, which promotes evOLvability of the primary surface antigen, VlsE. The hypothesis that diversity of vls and cassettes favored by natural selection is supported by classical (dN/dS ratios) and Bayesian population genetic analyses and genetic sequence data. This hypothesis supported conservation of highly mutable tandem-repeat structures in B. burgdorfi strains despite near complete absence of sequence conservation. Diversification of vl cassettes and natural selection by mutable repeat structures promotes long-term antigenic evolvevability and VLSE.

The continued rise in antibiotic resistance stresses the need for better insights into the host defense mechanisms associated with pneumococcal pneumonia. The early innate immune response that constitutes bacterial phagocytosis, complement activation and inflammation is critical for the outcome during pneumonia. The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2) has recently been shown to be both a negative regulator of the inflammatory response and a promoter of phagocytosis, but its contribution to pneumonia remains unknown. In our study, we unexpectedly found that alveolar macrophage expressed TREM-2 is detrimental in bacterial phagocytosis and clearance during pneumococcal pneumonia. This occurred via the suppressive effects of TREM-2 on complement component 1q (C1q), an important regulator of bacterial phagocytosis that is crucial for the host response during pneumonia. Thus, targeting the TREM-2 pathway could be used as a novel strategy for modulating C1q production and pulmonary innate immune responses, which could be of clinical relevance during pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections.","Phagocytosis inflammation in the lungs is crucial for the host defense against bacterial pneumonia.

However, the role of Th17 cells in protection against S. japonicum infection is still unclear. For the first time, we describe here the changes in Th17 cell levels during S. japonicum infection and suggest that the schistosome egg antigens are primarily responsible for stimulating the generation of host Th17 cells after S. japonicum infection. We further show that the level of Th17 cells in the host is determined by a combination of factors, namely exposure to complex parasitic antigens that either induce or suppress their generation. We also suggest that lowering IL-17 levels may favor the host's protective responses against S. japonicum infection. Our findings help to better understand the relationship between the host and parasite in terms of immune protection and pathology in schistosomiasis and may contribute to the future development of vaccination and therapeutic strategies.","Schistosomiasis is a major tropical helminthic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Schistosoma japonicum.

In the soil, these fungi grow as mold that produce infectious spores; when inhaled into the warmer lungs of a mammalian host, the spores convert into yeast, which cause infection. The change in shape between mold and yeast is a crucial event in the lifecycle of these fungi. The molecular regulation of this morphologic switch, or phase transition, is poorly understood. The goal of our research was to identify and characterize novel gene(s) that govern the phase transition in dimorphic fungi using Blastomyces dermatitidis as a model organism. Using insertional mutagenesis, we identified a gene, SREB, which encodes a transcription factor that affects phase transition and regulates the production of iron-gathering molecules or siderophores. When SREB is deleted, B. dermatitidis fails to complete the conversion from yeast to mold, grows poorly at environmental temperature, has yellow-orange colony pigmentation, and cannot properly repress the biosynthesis of siderophores. We also identified two types of siderophores produced by B. dermatitidis. To our knowledge, SREB is the first gene identified that promotes the conversion from yeast to mold, a process important for survival in the environment and generation of infectious spores.","Blastomyces dermatitidis belongs to a group of human pathogenic fungi that exhibit thermal dimorphism. At 22 °C, fungi grow mold, produce conidia and infectious particles, and at 37 °C convert budding yeast into budding yeast. The ability to switch forms is essential for mammals to survive in soil. To identify genes that regulate phase transition, Agrobacterium tumefaciens mutagenize the fungus and we screened transformants for defects in morphogenesis. We found that the GATA transcription factor SREB regulates multiple fates of B. dermatitis: phase transition in yeast mold, cell growth at 22°C, and biosynthesis of siderophores in iron-replete conditions. Insertional null mutants fail to convert into mold, accumulate significant biomass at 22 ° C, and are unable to suppress siderophile biosynthesis under iron-releting conditions. We also found that a defect in the morphogenesis of a SreB mutant is independent of exogenous iron concentration, suggesting that SREBs promotes phase transition by altering expression of genes unrelated to siderothore biosynthesis. These findings shed light on the environmental persistence of pathogens."

Both the choice and capacity of DNA repair pathways are tightly regulated in response to environmental cues and cell cycle phase. Recent work has uncovered the importance of protein modifications, such as phosphorylation and sumoylation, in this regulation. Sumoylation is known to be critical for the efficient repair of highly toxic DNA double-strand breaks in both yeast and humans, and this is partly mediated by influencing DNA end resection. However, it has been unclear for which resection factor sumoylation is important, how sumoylation influences specific attributes of the relevant targets, and how this modification is coordinated with phosphorylation-based regulation. Here, we provide exciting new insights into these issues by revealing that 1) a conserved end resection factor is a SUMO target relevant to this process, 2) this regulation favors a specific repair pathway, 3) sumoylation collaborates with phosphorylation to promote protein solubility, and 4) sumoylation influences DNA repair via an “ensemble effect” that entails simultaneous small alterations of multiple substrates. Our work reveals both a novel mechanism and a general principle for SUMO-mediated regulation of DNA repair.","Protein modifications regulate DNA repair levels through a pathway of choice. How the modification achieves these regulatory effects depends on how different modifications collaborate. Here, we show that sumoylation regulates double-strand break repair partly by modifying the end resection factor Sae2. This modification is conserved in yeast and humans, and induced DNA damage. We mapped the sumoylated site of Sae 2 to a single lysine self-association domain. Abolishing Sae1 by sumoylating the lysines arginine and mutating lysinine impaired the function of the enzyme in the processing of repair of multiple types of DNA breaks. We found that the effect of this modification is independent of phosphorylation, and that the modifications act synergy to increase the soluble forms of the protein. Our findings reveal a novel role for sumoylations in DNA repair by regulating the solubility of the end-resection factor. This collaboration between different modifications on multiple substrates leads to a stronger biological effect."

Although antibiotic treatment has been very successful in treating UTI, antibiotic resistance is rising and recurrent infections are a common and costly problem affecting millions of women. Here, we examine an experimental mouse model of chronic bladder infection with uropathogenic E. coli, the most common cause of UTI. We found that the development of chronic bladder infection was preceded by severe bladder tissue inflammation that results in injury to the lining of the bladder. Furthermore, immunodeficient mice that lacked these acute inflammatory responses were protected from chronic bladder infection, suggesting that the development of chronic bladder infection requires immune-mediated tissue damage during acute infection. Finally, we demonstrate that mice with a history of chronic bladder infection that was subsequently cleared with antibiotic treatment are highly susceptible to further UTI. Thus, this study has discovered possible overlap in the mechanisms underlying the development of chronic and recurrent UTI.","Chronic infections are an increasing problem in the aging population, and the increase of antibiotic resistant organisms is increasing. However, understanding the host-pathogen interactions that result in chronic infection is of great importance. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of chronic bacterial cystitis in C3H mice. We establish that the introduction of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) into bladders of C3h mice results in two distinct disease outcomes: resolution of acute infection and development of chronic cysticitis lasting months. We found that the onset of chronic infection preceded biomarkers of local systemic acute inflammation 24 hours post-infection, including severe pyuria of bladder inflammation and mucosal injury, as well as a distinct serum cytokine signature consisting of elevated IL-5, IL-6, G-CSF, and IL-8 analog KC. Mice deficient in TLR4 signaling lymphocytes lack innate responses to infection and are resistant to infection, to varying degrees, to developing chronic infection. Treatment with the glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone prior to UPEC infection suppresses the development and progression of chronic inflammation. Finally, we found that individuals with a history of chronic Cystitis, lasting 14 days, were significantly more susceptible to redeveloping into a severe, chronic infection than those with a prior history of bacterial challenge. These findings have significant implications for understanding how early infection leads to chronic bacterial infection and the fate of disease."

Over the past years, such macroscopic rhythms have been suggested to play a crucial role in routing the flow of information across cortical regions, resulting in a functional connectome. The underlying mechanism is cortical oscillations that bind together following a well-known motif called phase-locking. While there is significant experimental support for multiple phase-locking modes in the brain, it is still unclear what is the underlying mechanism that permits macroscopic rhythms to phase lock. In the present paper we take up with this issue, and to show that, one can study the emergent macroscopic phase-locking within the mathematical framework of weakly coupled oscillators. We find that under synaptic delays, fully symmetrically coupled networks can display symmetry-broken states of activity, where one network starts to lead in phase the second (also sometimes known as stuttering states). When we analyse how incoming transient signals affect the coupled system, we find that in the symmetry-broken state, the effect depends strongly on which network is targeted (the leader or the follower) as well as the timing of the input. Hence we show how the dynamics of the emergent phase-locked activity imposes a functional directionality on how signals are processed. We thus offer clarification on the synaptic and circuit properties responsible for the emergence of multiple phase-locking patterns and provide support for its functional implication in information transfer.","Macroscopic oscillations can arise in different brain regions, and multiple phase relationships are persistent over time and implicated in routing information. While multiple cellular mechanisms influence the network oscillatory dynamics and structure of macroscopic firing motifs, key questions are to identify biophysical neuronal synaptic properties that permit these motifs to arise. The second important issue is how different neural activity and coherence states determine communication between neural circuits. Here we analyse the emergence of phase-locking bidirectionally delayed-combined spiking circuits in the global gamma band oscillations that arise from synaptic coupling largely excitable neurons. We consider the interneuronal (ING) and pyramidal-interneurononal (PING) population of gamma rhythms that arise by inter coupling targeting pyramides and inhibitory neurons. Using a mean-field approach to the exact reduction method, we reduce the spiking network to a low dimensional nonlinear system. We derive a phase equation coupled system that links synaptic mechanisms to coherence state in the system. Our analysis shows that symmetry breaking, i.e. non-symmetric phase lag, is the preferred direction of signal transfer between oscillatory networks and directionality depends on the timing of the signal. We suggest a causal theory of oscillatory modulation of functional connectivity in cortical circuits."

These are detectable by surveying for evidence of balancing selection, as previously illustrated in analyses of genes encoding malaria parasite antigens that are candidate targets of naturally acquired immunity. For a comprehensive screen to discover targets of immunity in the major human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, an endemic population in West Africa was sampled and genome sequence data obtained from 65 clinical isolates, allowing analysis of polymorphism in almost all protein-coding genes. Antigen genes previously studied by capillary re-sequencing in independent population samples had highly concordant indices in the genome-wide analysis here, and this has identified other genes with stronger evidence of balancing selection, now prioritized for functional study and potential vaccine candidacy. The statistical signatures consistent with such selection were particularly common in genes with peak expression at the stage that invades erythrocytes, and members of several gene families were represented. The strongest signature was in the msp3-like gene PF10_0355, so we studied the transcript and protein product in parasites, revealing an unexpected pattern of phase variable expression. Variation in expression of polymorphic antigens under balancing selection may be more common than previously thought, requiring further study to assess vaccine candidacy.","Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria in the Gambian population. The parasite is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito, which causes severe disease in humans and other vertebrates. In this study, we generated paired-end short-read sequences of parasites from clinical isolates from the endemic Gambian malaria population, and mapped them to a 3D7 strain reference genome to yield high-quality genome-wide coding sequence data from 65 isolates. We found that the majority of the genes map reliably, including hypervariable var, rifin, stevor families, 5,056 genes (90.9% of genome) > 70% sequence coverage and minimum read depth in 5 50 isolates, and 2,853 genes contained 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analysis of polymorphic site frequency spectra. The overall background of negatively skewed frequencies was expected to be due to historical population expansion combined with purifying selection, outlying minority genes signatures indicating exceptionally intermediate frequencies were identified. Comparing genes with different stage-specific, signatures of the common peak expression of the merozoite stage invades erythrocytes were highly represented, with the strongest signature being the msp3-like gene PF10_0355. Our results suggest that the target of balancing selection is prioritized for a functional study."

To stop the spread of LF, a program led by the World Health Organization (WHO) offers annual preventive drug treatment to affected communities. For people who already have lymphedema, WHO recommends simple hygiene-based measures that include skin care and limb movement. Yet only a small proportion of those with LF-related lymphedema have been trained in these measures. To determine the effectiveness of hygiene-based lymphedema management, we reviewed the scientific literature. Twenty-two studies were found that 1) used hygiene-based interventions to manage lymphedema; 2) measured the effect of these interventions; and 3) were done in an area where LF occurs. Overall, use of hygiene-based measures was associated with 60% lower odds of inflammatory episodes, known as “acute attacks,” in the affected limb. Acute attacks cause severe pain, fever, and disability, and they make lymphedema worse. Hygiene and sanitation are necessary for control of many tropical diseases. Hygiene is also effective for managing LF-related lymphedema and reducing suffering caused by acute attacks. Training people with lymphedema in hygiene-based interventions should be a priority for LF programs everywhere.","Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease that affects more than 14 million people worldwide.

This difference could be caused either by generic differences in the way immunity is acquired or by a relatively higher exposure to P. vivax blood-stage infections in early life. We found that children experienced an average of 14 new P. vivax blood-stage infections per year, and that the number of new infections acquired predicted how often children fell ill with vivax malaria by genotyping all P. vivax infections that occurred in a group of 264 children 1–4 years of age followed for 16 months. The burden of blood-stage infections caused by P. vivax was therefore at least twice as high as that caused by P. falciparum. This higher force-of-blood-stage infection (molFOB) caused by P. vivax is at least partially due to the ability of P. vivax hypnozoites to relapse from long-lasting liver stages. A high exposure to P. vivax blood-stage infection resulted in more rapid decrease in the incidence of P. vivax malaria. The high number of P. vivax clones that infect children in early childhood is thus likely to contribute substantially to the rapid acquisition of immunity against clinical P. vivax malaria.","Plasmodium vivax is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that affects more than 1.5 million people in Papua New Guinea. It is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children, and it has been reported that the incidence of P. falciparum is higher in children living in highly endemic areas of Papua New Guinean. To identify the differences in the number of blood stage infections and the potential link between acquisition of immunity, we estimated the molecular force of blood-stage infection of malaria parasites. We found that the prevalence of malaria infection in children was higher in the high-risk group compared to those with low exposure. The incidence of malaria in children with high exposure was also higher in those who had low exposure to malaria. The high incidence of clinical malaria was strongly associated with molFOB (the incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.99, 95% confidence interval (CI95) [1.80, 2.19], and molFOBs did not change with age. This suggests that the high number of malaria parasite clones infecting children in early childhood may contribute to rapid acquisition immunity against clinical P. vivx malaria."

Here we study the sensing properties of a simple and generic allosteric sensor to understand the effectiveness and limitations of its “design”. We begin by defining and calculating a set of six engineering-inspired characteristics of the sensor’s response and investigate how specifying a high performance in one characteristic constrains the sensor’s performance in others. We determine many such trade-offs and, perhaps surprisingly, that much of the space of characteristics is inaccessible given biophysically plausible ranges of parameters. Our results suggest that allosteric sensors are not under selection for high performance in one sensing characteristic but for a compromise in performance between many. Our approach provides both quantitative and qualitative insights about the function and robustness of allosteric sensors and as such is applicable to both the study of endogenous systems and the design of synthetic ones.","Sensing extracellular changes initiates the signal transduction stage of cellular decision-making. However, relatively little is known about how sensing biochemistry is selected. To gain insight into this question, we studied sensing characteristics of the biochemically simplest sensors: the allosteric transcription factor. We determined sensing characteristics that directly transduce the detection of sensed molecule changes in gene regulation. We found that sensing characteristics – dynamic range, Hill number, intrinsic noise, information transfer capacity, static gain, mean response time, and function of biochemical parameters—are strongly constrains. For example, high dynamic range implies high Hill number and high capacity, vice versa. We also found that the constraints of strong space characteristics are inaccessible given biophysically plausible ranges of parameter values. Our approximations, calculate the probability distribution of numbers of input molecules maximizes information transfer across the population. We conclude that high sensing characteristics are unlikely to compromise performance."

One of them is: how homogeneous is AD? Is the course of progression more or less the same for most patients, or are there large variations? Our paper studies a large cohort of AD patients which comes from a 23-year-long study, and performs a statistical analysis of progression speed. We quantify the amount of spread in GDS/FAST stage durations (a staging system widely used by clinicians). We arrive at an astonishing conclusion that the mean length of AD stages is comparable with their standard deviation! This means that individual courses of AD progression may differ very much from each other, and from the textbook mean values. This has implications both for clinical trials (how do we assess if a new drug is effective, if the amount of natural spread is so large in untreated patients?), and for our understanding of this disease, which appears to be comprised of sub-diseases with different patterns of decline.","Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States. The disease is caused by a combination of genetic mutations in the brain that can lead to a variety of neurological disorders, including dementia.

The GDS/FAST stage has published mean duration, but the variance is unknown. We use statistical analysis to reconstruct the GDS and FAST stage durations in a cohort of 648 AD patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years. Calculations of GDS /FAST stages 4–6 reveal standard deviations in stage and durations comparable to mean values, indicating the presence of large variations in AD progression in patients. The heterogeneity in course progression in AD is consistent with the existence of sub-groups of AD patients, which differ in patterns of decline and decline."

In order to visualize networks of brain regions activated by recall of a fear memory in mice, we quantified expression of an activity-regulated gene (c-fos) that is induced by neural activity. This allowed us to identify collections of brain regions where Fos expression co-varies across mice, and presumably form components of a network that are co-active during recall of long-term fear memory. This analysis suggested that expression of a long-term fear memory is an emergent property of large scale neural network interactions. This network has a distinct thalamic-hippocampal-cortical signature and, like many real-world networks as well as other anatomical and functional brain networks, has small-world architecture with a subset of highly-connected hub nodes that may play more central roles in memory expression.","Long-term memories are thought to depend on coordinated activation of a broad network of cortical subcortical brain regions. However, the distributed nature of representation is challenging to define neural elements of memory trace, and lesion electrophysiological approaches provide a narrow window to the appreciated global network.

Our analysis of Fos expression in 84 brain regions allowed us to identify regions co-active following memory recall. Our analyses revealed that the functional organization of memory recall depends on memory age and altered mutant mice exhibit premature forgetting. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that long-lasting memory recall engages a distinct thalamic- hippocampal-cortex signature. This network is concurrently integrated into segregated small-world properties, and contains hub-like regions of the prefrontal cortex and thalamus that play privileged roles in memory expression."

Heat shock gene activation involves the synthesis of poly-[ADP-ribose] (PAR) at heat shock loci, the opening of chromatin structure, and the coordinated recruitment of transcription factors and chromatin regulators RNA polymerase II and components of the RNA processing machinery. The molecular roles of PAR and and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers in heat shock gene activation are not clear. We show here that the chromatin remodeler dMi-2 is recruited to Drosophila heat shock genes in a PAR–dependent manner. We provide evidence that recruitment involves direct binding of dMi-2 to PAR polymers and identify novel PAR sensing regions in the dMi-2 protein, including the chromodomains and a series of motifs rich in K and R residues. Upon HS gene activation, dMi-2 associates with nascent transcripts. In addition, we find that dMi-2 and its catalytic activity are important for heat shock gene activation and co-transcriptional RNA processing efficiency. Our study uncovers a novel role of PAR during heat shock gene activation and establishes an unanticipated link between chromatin remodeler activity and RNA processing.","Eukaryotic cells respond to genomic environmental stresses, such as DNA damage from heat shock (HS), synthesis of poly-[ADP-ribose] (PAR) specific chromatin regions, DNA breaks from HS genes, and PAR polymerases (PARP) are required for efficient transcriptional response.

Here, we identified several regions of the chromatin that bind PAR independently in vitro, including chromodomains and regions near the N-terminus containing motifs rich in K R residues. In addition, we found that the binding of the nascent HS gene transcripts, which are catalytic activity required for the efficient transcription of co-transcriptional RNA processing, is a step in the recruitment process.

A perfect diagnostic test would detect every infected dog (100% sensitivity) whilst never giving a false positive reaction in non-infected dogs (100% specificity). Since no such test exists, it is important to understand the performance of available diagnostic techniques. We used the results of a study that used three diagnostic tests on dogs from the Tibetan plateau, where there is co-endemicity of E. granulosus and E. multilocularis. In this study opro-antigen ELISA and copro-PCR diagnostic tests were undertaken on faecal samples from all animals. The dogs were also purged with arecoline hydrobromide to recover adult parasites as a highly specific but relatively insensitive third diagnostic test. We used a statistical approach (Bayesian latent-class models) to estimate simultaneously the sensitivities of all three tests and the specificities of the copro-antigen and copro-PCR tests. We also analysed how some determinants of infection can affect parasite prevalence. This approach provides a robust framework to increase the accuracy of surveillance and epidemiological studies of echinococcosis by overcoming the problems of poor diagnostic test performance.","Dino echinococcosis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium Echinococcus multilocularis, which is transmitted by the dog Taenia spp. The disease is endemic in the Tibetan plateau, where it has been reported in a largely deterministic way. In this study, we used a set of faecal purge samples to explore the epidemiology and sensitivities of canine echinocytosis in Tibetan plateau. We used a latent-class model to examine the diagnostic performance of the genus specific copro-antigen ELISA, species-specific copro and arecoline purgation. The dependence of the structure of the diagnostic tests was analysed in a parsimonious manner, which indicated deviance-of-information criteria. We suggested that co-infection with Taenias spp was a significant covariate of Echinoccus infection. The diagnostic performance was 89% and 84% respectively, respectively, for the diagnosis of E. multilibocularis and E. granulosus. The specificities of copro-, ELISA and werecoline sensitivities were 55% and 57% respectively. The diagnosis of both E.multilibularis and the E.granulososus specificities were 71 and 69%, respectively. These results show that incorporating diagnostic uncertainty, words assuming the perfect gold standard, including potential covariates like sex and Taeniae co-infection epidemiological analysis, different results and diagnosis of infection status are assumed to be the most deterministic approach possible."

In simple eukaryotes, chromosomal loci are preferentially replicated at specific times of S phase, in part because of their differential sensitivity to cell cycle regulators and in part as a result of random choice. Mammals, with ∼250-fold larger genomes, have more complex replication programs, within which different classes of chromatin replicate at defined times. While the basic regulatory mechanisms in higher eukaryotes are conserved, it is unclear how their much more complex timing program is maintained. We use replication precursor analogues, which can be visualized in living or fixed cells, to monitor the spatial relationship of DNA domains that are replicated at different times of S phase. Analyzing individual chromosome, we show that a major mechanism regulating transitions in the S phase timing program involves the sequential activation of replication domains based on their genetic continuity. Our analysis of the mechanism of S phase progression in single cells provides an alternative to genome-wide strategies, which define patterns of replication using cell populations. In combination, these complimentary strategies provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of S phase timing in mammalian cells.","DNA synthesis is performed with extreme precision to maintain genomic integrity. In mammalian cells, different genomic regions are replicated at different times, to preserve epigenetic information and cell differentiation status. However, the molecular principles that define the S phase program remain unknown. By analyzing the replication foci of discrete chromosome territories during interphase, we demonstrate that the spatial continuity of replication and foci correlates with genetic continuity of adjacent replicon clusters on chromosomes. Finally, bioinformatic tools compare the structure of DNA foci and DNA domains seen to replicate at discrete time intervals during S phase genome-wide strategies. Our data presented a major mechanism for S phase progression, which involves sequential synthesis of regions of the genome that maintain genetic continuity and chromosomal fiber."

Some of these effects are the cause of the widespread illicit use of marijuana, while others might be involved in the potential therapeutic use of this drug for the treatment of several neuronal disorders. The great majority of these effects of THC are mediated by cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), which is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system. The exact anatomical and neuronal substrates of each action are, however, not clearly known at the moment. We addressed this issue by using an advanced genetic approach. Control and conditional mutant mice, lacking CB1 expression in defined neuronal subpopulations but not in others, were treated with THC, and typical effects of the drug on motor behaviour, pain, and thermal sensation were scored. Our results show that different neuronal subpopulations mediate different effects of THC and could lead to a refined interpretation of the pharmacological actions of cannabinoids. Moreover, these data might provide the rationale for the development of drugs capable of selectively activating CB1 in specific neuronal subpopulations, thereby better exploiting cannabinoids' potential therapeutic properties.","The main psychotropic ingredient Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exerts a plethora of psychoactive effects through the activation of neuronal cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), which is expressed in different neuronal subpopulations of the central nervous system. The exact neuroanatomical substrates underlying the effect of THC, however, is not known. We tested the locomotor, hypothermic, analgesic, and cataleptic effects of THC conditional knockout mouse lines, and found that CB1 was expressed in a wide range of neurons, including principal brain neurons, GABAergic neurons (release γ aminobutyric acid) and cortical glutamatergic neurons, and neurons expressing dopamine receptor D1, respectively. Surprisingly, mice lacking CB1 GABAergic and GABAergic neuron responded to THC similarly to wild-type littermates, but deletion of CB1 in principal neurons abolished strongly reduced behavioural and autonomic responses to the drug. Moreover, locomotor and hypothermic effects of the drug depend on the functional expression of GABAergic interneurons, which are important for neuronal function. These data pave the way for refined interpretation of the pharmacological effects of cannabinoids and neuronal functions."

Given the static nature of current pharmaceuticals and vaccines, natural selection inevitably drives pathogens to mutate into drug-resistant variants that can resume productive replication. Further, these drug-resistant mutants transmit across populations, resulting in untreatable epidemics. Recently, a therapeutic strategy was proposed in which viral deletion mutants—termed therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs)—are engineered to only replicate by stealing their missing proteins from full-length viruses in co-infected cells. By stealing essential viral proteins, these engineered molecular parasites have been predicted to reduce viral levels in patients and viral transmission events across populations. Yet, a critical question is whether rapidly mutating viruses like HIV can evolve around TIP control by reducing production of the proteins that TIPs must steal in order to replicate (i.e., by ‘starving’ the TIPs). Here we develop a multi-scale model that tests whether TIP-starving HIV mutants can spread across populations to undermine TIP therapy campaigns at the population-scale. Strikingly, model results show that inherent evolutionary tradeoffs prevent these TIP-resistant HIV mutants from increasing in frequency (i.e., these TIP-resistant HIV mutants are continually outcompeted by TIP-sensitive mutants in both patients and populations). Maintained by natural selection, TIPs may offer a novel therapeutic approach to indefinitely control rapidly evolving viral pandemics.","The rapid evolution of RNA-encoded viruses in HIV presents a major barrier to infectious disease control and conventional pharmaceuticals. Previously, it was proposed that defective interfering particles could be developed indefinitely to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic; individual patients, engineered molecular parasites predicted refractory HIV mutational escape (i.e., ‘resistance-proof’). However, the outstanding question is whether engineered interfering particles— termed Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs)—would remain resistance-proof at the population-scale. Here, we develop a multi-scale model to test whether TIPs can maintain indefinite control of HIV at the HIV population-size. We find that TIP-resistant HIV mutants continually outcompete TIP resistant HIV mutants by limiting the production of viral proteins that are available to HIV mutants to parasitize. Our results capture the existence of intrinsic evolutionary tradeoffs that collectively prevent the spread of HIV mutants in the patient population scale. First, despite increased transmission rates in TIP treated sub- populations, unilateral TIP–resistant mutants have shown reduced transmission rates compared to TIP untreated sub-population. Second, TIP and resistant mutants have reduced growth rates and replicative fitness compared to those of TIP or untreated individuals. These results provide design constraints for engineering population-level therapies that can be used to prevent the acquisition of antiviral resistance."

By studying the evolution of the transferrin receptor, which the virus uses to enter a cell, we discovered that the ancestors of dogs were likely infected by a parvovirus millions of years ago until they evolved and became resistant; this was caused by their transferrin receptor changing so it no longer bound the virus. When a variant virus that infects dogs emerged in the 1970s, it had adapted to overcome this block. This story suggests that diseases which were once eliminated from a species can evolve and regain the infectivity for that host, therefore having high potential to be emerging diseases. We identified features of the receptor that were important to the evolution of this host-virus interaction and confirmed their role in regulating virus binding in cell culture.","Parvoviruses exploit the transferrin receptor type-1 (TfR) for cellular entry into carnivores, where specific interactions are key to control the host range. Here, we show that key mutations acquired during TfR evolution in Caniforms (dogs related species) have modified interactions with parvovirus capsids reducing the level of binding. We show that these mutations are signatures of a positive selection for the TFRC gene, consistent with an evolutionary arms race between the TfRs and Caniform clade of parviviruses. We also show that a glycosylation site mutation in the TFR in dogs provided resistance to carnivore parvirus infection prior to the speciation of coyotes and dogs. Our results suggest that the evolution of canine parvvirus resistance in dogs prior to 1975 predates speciation by coyotes or dogs."

TBEV causes febrile illness and encephalitis in humans in forested regions of Europe and Asia. The incidence of TBE is increasing across Central and Eastern European countries despite the availability of several licensed inactivated vaccines and appropriate vaccination programmes. Large-scale codon re-encoding, a recently developed attenuation method that modifies viral RNA nucleotide composition of large coding regions without alteration of the encoded proteins, has been successfully applied to a variety of RNA viruses. In contrast with previous empirical methods of generating live attenuated vaccines, large-scale codon re-encoding facilitates rapid generation of vaccine candidates using reverse genetics methods, by direct control of the attenuation phenotype. Additional benefits include reduced costs and induction of long-term immunity. Here, we have applied the large-scale codon re-encoding method to the TBEV to demonstrate the principle of developing a live attenuated virus vaccine which protects mice against subsequent infection with the wild type virulent virus. This study therefore illustrates that codon re-encoding is potentially an easily derived and effective method of producing live attenuated vaccine candidates against positive-stranded RNA viruses.","Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes febrile illness in humans and forested regions of Europe and Asia.

Mice infected with the infected-type-encoding virus produced comparable amounts of neutralising antibodies. These results provide evidence that mammalian species have protected against infection with a virulent wild- type positive-stranded RNA virus following immunisation with a randomly-enriched strain."

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to interrupt transmission. Currently, there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of leprosy. Bacilloscopy and histopathology studies are complementary exams that provide high specificity but low sensitivity.

De novo prion appearance can be made very frequent in yeast by transient overexpression of the prion protein in the presence of heterologous prions or prion-like aggregates. Here, we show that the aggregates of one such newly induced prion are initially formed in a dot-like structure near the vacuole. These dots then grow into rings at the periphery of the cell prior to becoming smaller rings surrounding the vacuole and maturing into the characteristic heritable prion tiny dots found throughout the cytoplasm. We found considerable colocalization of two heterologous prion/prion-like aggregates with the newly appearing prion protein aggregates, which is consistent with the prevalent model that existing prion aggregates can cross-seed the de novo aggregation of a heterologous prion protein. However, we failed to find any physical interaction between another heterologous aggregating protein and the newly appearing prion aggregates it stimulated to appear, which is inconsistent with cross-seeding.","Prions are self-replicating conformational variants of particular proteins.

The asynapsis of orthologous chromosomes occurred in meiosis of male and female hybrids, though only males were sterile due to trans-acting male-specific hybrid sterility genes. We located one of the two major hybrid sterility genes to a 4.7 Mb interval on Chromosome X, showed that it controls male sterility by modulating the extent of meiotic asynapsis and using the inter-subspecific chromosome substitution strains we refuted the simple interpretation of dominance theory of Haldane's rule.

Differences in the magnitudes of the set of eigenvalues between two structures can be used to calculate differences in entropy. We introduce ENCoM the first coarse-grained NMA method to consider atom-specific side-chain interactions and thus account for the effect of mutations on eigenvectors and eigenvalues. ENCoM performs better than existing NMA methods with respect to traditional applications of NMA methods but is the first to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability and function. Comparing ENCoM to a large set of dedicated methods for the prediction of the effect of mutations on protein stability shows that ENCoM performs better than existing methods particularly on stabilizing mutations. ENCoM is the first entropy-based method developed to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability.","Normal mode analysis (NMA) methods are widely used to study dynamic aspects of protein structures.

Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, the thalamus, cortex and cerebellum are implicated in the underlying pathology. More recently, it has been shown that ET can be successfully treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS). This clinical treatment involves the surgical implantation of electrodes into the brain, through which current is applied. However, the mechanisms of how DBS achieves clinical benefit continue to be debated. A key question is whether ET can be modeled as a pathological network behavior as has been suggested previously. If so, we can then ask how DBS would modulate this brain activity. Our study combines: (i) simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the brain and muscle; (ii) computational modelling; (iii) mathematical analysis. We found that the network supports oscillations in the tremor range, and the application of high frequency DBS switches this to low amplitude, high-frequency activity. We propose that our model can be used to predict DBS parameter settings that suppress pathological network activity and consequently tremor. In summary, we provide the first population level model of essential tremor including the effect of DBS on network behaviour.","Essential tremor (ET) is a movement disorder characterised by uncontrollable shaking of the affected body, which is a common movement disorder affecting about 40% of adults over 40 years of age. The precise cause of ET is unknown, and pathological oscillations in the network of a number of brain regions are implicated in the leading disorder. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) clinical therapy has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of an increasing number of movement disorders. DBS involves surgical implantation of electrodes in specific nuclei of the brain. The ET is targeted to a region of the ventralis intermedius (Vim) of the nucleus thalamus. Although DBS is effective in treating ET, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect is not fully understood. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the pathological network activity and the effect of DBS activity, we developed a computational modelling approach that combined electrophysiological data and computational modelling. We modelled the network using intra-operatively implanted DBS electrodes, whilst simultaneously recording muscle activity in affected limbs. The modelled network was hypothesised to underlie the ET Wilson-Cowan approach. Our model showed that the dynamics of the ET network support oscillations of tremor frequency, and that application of a DBS-like input disrupts the activity, which may be the mechanism for its therapeutic benefit."

There are two types of Salmonella–Typhi and non-typhoidal (NTS). In humans, the majority of illnesses caused by NTS are related to gastro-intestinal problems, though uncommonly, it also invades the bloodstream. On the other hand, typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi commonly invades the bloodstream. Since the treatment of the two types may differ, we wanted to compare the risk factors for each. We studied patients who had NTS or Typhi isolated from blood in a diarrheal hospital in Bangladesh. We observed that patients with NTS bloodstream infection frequently presented with severe malnutrition, clinically diagnosed sepsis and pneumonia compared to those with typhoid fever. We also found that NTS and Typhi differed in what antibiotics they were sensitive to. These observations may help our clinicians to initiate aggressive treatment from the very beginning of the illness in children with NTS bacteremia in order to attain better outcomes.","Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and Typhi bacteremia are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The paucity of data on NTS and typhoid in South Asia, the region with the highest incidence of typhoidal bactemia, has led to the need to determine the clinical predictors of outcomes associated with NTS and bactermia compared to typhoid bacters. We performed a retrospective age-matched case-control study of patients admitted to Dhaka Hospital International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, between February 2009 and March 2013. We compared demographic, clinical, microbiological, and outcome variables in NTS bactera patients with age- matched S. Typhi and basteremic patients, and in separate comparison patients with NTS or typhoid gastroenteritis. We found that in NTS patients with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), clinical sepsis, pneumonia, and pneumonia were independent risk factors for NTS and S. typhoid. Furthermore, we found marked differences in antibiotic susceptibilities, including NTS strains resistant to antibiotics commonly used in empiric therapy for patients suspected of typhoid fever."

Mammalian cells encode many poly(A)-specific exoribonucleases, but their individual roles are poorly understood. Here, we undertook an analysis of the role of PARN deadenylase in mouse myoblasts using global measurements of mRNA decay rates. Our results reveal that a discrete set of mRNAs exhibit altered mRNA decay as a result of PARN depletion and that stabilization is associated with increased poly(A) tail length and translation efficiency. We determined that stabilization of mRNAs does not generally result in their increased abundance, supporting the idea that mRNA decay is coupled to transcription. Importantly, knockdown of PARN has wide ranging effects on gene expression that specifically impact the extracellular matrix and cell migration.","PARN is a deadenylase enzyme that is present in mammalian cells, but its contribution to regulation of gene expression remains unclear. To address this issue, we performed global mRNA expression half-life analysis in mouse myoblasts depleted of PARN. PARN knockdown resulted in stabilization of 40 mRNAs, including the mRNA decay factor ZFP36L2. Additional experiments demonstrated that PARN-dependent regulation induced an increase in Zfp36l2 poly(A) tail length and increased translation. Surprisingly, changes in mRNA stability showed an inverse correlation with mRNA abundance; stabilized transcripts showed a change in mRNA abundance and reduced mRNA abundance. Our data provide compelling evidence that coupling mRNA decay and transcription buffer mRNA abundances has a larger effect on global gene expression. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that mRNA abundance reduced by PARN and that these genes encode factors that are required for cell migration and adhesion. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms by which PARN regulates gene expression and suggest that the function of these genes is important for cell movement."

Previous studies indicated that the pathway of HIV-1 particle morphogenesis is distinct in primary human macrophages, and this has been suggested to play a role in viral persistence. Early reports indicated that HIV-1 accumulates within apparently intracellular vacuolar structures, which were later identified as being of late endosomal origin. Endosomes were therefore suggested to comprise the budding and storage compartment for HIV-1 in primary human macrophages, from which infectious virus can be released in a regulated manner. In the present study, we show that HIV-1 budding occurs predominantly at the plasma membrane also in primary human macrophages. Using electron microscopy, we observed that the cell surface of macrophages displays an unexpectedly complex morphology with many protrusions and deep invaginations. HIV-1 budding occurs primarily at these invaginations that are clearly connected to the cell surface and do not belong to the endocytic compartment. Mature virus particles can remain trapped within such invaginations giving the appearance of an intracellular budding compartment. These results suggest a general pathway of HIV-1 morphogenesis with the plasma membrane as viral budding site.","HIV-1 assembly is believed to occur in the plasma membrane of host cells, with the exception of primary macrophages. However, exclusive budding of late endosomes has been reported. Here, we applied a novel ultrastructural approach to assess HIV-1 budding in primary and secondary macrophage in an immunomarker-independent manner. We found that HIV budding profiles were virtually excluded from gold-filled endosome-positive membranes, but were frequently detected in ruthenium red–positive membranes. The composition of cellular marker proteins incorporated into HIV–1 was supported by a plasma membrane–derived origin of the viral envelope. Contrary to current opinion, plasma membrane is the primary site of HIV-2 budding in infected macrophaging."

As mitochondria play various roles in cellular and tissue-specific contexts, the symptoms of mitochondrial pathologies can differ between patients. Thus, diagnosis and treatment of mitochondrial disorders remain challenging. To enhance this, the generation of new models that explore and define the consequences of mitochondria insufficiencies is of central importance. Here, we present a mia40a zebrafish mutant as a model for mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by an imbalance in mitochondrial protein biogenesis. This mutant shares characteristics with existing reports on mitochondria dysfunction, and has led us to identify novel phenotypes such as enlarged mitochondrial clusters in skeletal muscles. In addition, our transcriptomics and proteomics data contribute important findings to the existing knowledge on how faulty mitochondria impinge on vertebrate development in molecular, tissue and organ specific contexts.","The development of tissues and organs is powered by the activity of mitochondria. In humans, inherited genetic mutations lead to progressive mitochondrial pathology that manifest in infancy and can lead to death, reflecting the indispensable nature of mitochondrial biogenesis and function.

We report that mias40a mutant animals undergo progressive cellular respiration defects and develop enlarged mitochondria and skeletal muscles at the ultimate death of the larval stage. We also generated a deep transcriptomic proteomic resource that allowed us to identify abnormalities in the development of the endodermal organs, in particular the liver and pancreas.

Longitudinal entomological and human serology data from Iquitos, Peru, were used to test associations between Ae. aegypti indices and the 6-month risk of DENV seroconversion. Our analysis found no association between cross-sectional measures of Ae. aegypti abundance and the risk of DENV seroconversion. Longitudinal measures of Ae. aegypti were better proxies for DENV risk, primarily among adult stage mosquito indicators. DENV transmission is complex and time-varying; the relationship between vector density and risk is not static nor adequately characterized through periodic entomological surveillance. While entomological monitoring will continue to serve a role in the evaluation of vector control interventions (e.g., comparing pre- and post-intervention abundance), our analysis challenges the validity of most Ae. aegypti indicators as adequate proxies for true DENV exposure risk.","Dengue fever (DENV) is a mosquito-borne disease that is transmitted by the mosquito Ae. aegypti. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of the mosquito, which can be transmitted by mosquitoes. In this study, we measured the abundance of Ae.

We found that Ae.Ae.A. a. densities were associated with increased risk of DENV seroconversion. We also found that higher cross-sectional and longitudinal entomological data was associated with an increased risk for DENV infection. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown that increased cross-sectional and longitudinal data are associated with a higher risk of infection."

This study expands our understanding of risk factors for exposure to two common genera of mosquito-borne viruses, alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Risk factors identified include simple demographic factors, such as age or sex, and behaviors associated with occupation or livelihood around the home. Behaviors enhancing or limiting contact with mosquitoes are also significant predictors, as mosquitoes drive transmission. More clearly defining the epidemiology of these infections within a population can elevate the accuracy and efficacy of public health initiatives that fuel community education and awareness, and outbreak prediction and monitoring can be elevated to a new level of accuracy and efficacy.","Alphaviruses, chikungunya virus, and flaviviruses are re-emerging arboviruses in endemic tropical environments.

However, it is clear that these gene signatures do not fully reflect the complexity of human cancer. Here we demonstrate how a latent factor model can improve the in vivo relevance of these pathway-associated gene signatures by dissecting them into co-regulated transcriptional components which better represent the structure in human cancer. We use this approach to analyze hypoxia and lactic acidosis gene signatures to identify latent factors that represent distinct, interacting components of the various biological processes which are in the initial gene signatures but poorly dissected. Some factors are clustered in small chromosomal regions and their expression values are highly correlated with their DNA copy number in both cancer cell lines and human tumors. Therefore, the gene dosage at the DNA levels may explain the differences in gene expression. Several factors contain genes which are known to directly modulate the hypoxia response and allow us to generate testable hypotheses regarding particular copy number changes and hypoxia signatures. Therefore, the use of latent factor analysis is a powerful means to identify pathway-associated changes in the DNA copy number and gene dosage.","Tumor microenvironmental stresses, such as hypoxia and lactic acidosis, play important roles in tumor progression. However, gene signatures reflecting the influence of these stresses are powerful approaches to link expression phenotypes, and fully reflect the complexity of human cancers. Here, we describe the use of latent factor models to dissect stress gene signatures in a breast cancer expression dataset. We found that the genes that are coordinately expressed in tumors depict distinct, interacting components of biological processes. These genes are highly enriched in chromosomal locations, and their expression values are highly correlated with copy number alterations (CNAs) corresponding to BAC clones in cell lines and tumors. Furthermore, we found that variation in expression of pathway-associated factors is partially caused by variation in gene dosage and CNAs in breast cancers. We also found that expression of latent factors with chromosomal enrichment is highly associated with 12q CNA, likely the only instance in which “trans”-variations in CNA leads to variations in gene expression outside the CNA region. Our results suggest that tumor segmental aneuploidy makes significant contributions to variation in lactic and acidosis/hypoxia gene signatures and demonstrate latent factor analysis as a powerful means to uncover linkage."

It has long been known that the sequence of a protein, which is a string of different amino acids, can dictate how a protein molecule folds into a well-defined shape required for biological tasks. Many folded proteins recognize and bind with each other by a tight geometric fit similar to that between a lock and its key. Recently, however, it has become clear that some proteins function as a flexible string, in constant motion, without forming a stable shape. Understanding how such “disordered” proteins work is challenging. To gain insight, we studied a disordered protein region that causes a large family of human cancers. Employing an innovative combination of experimental and theoretical techniques, we describe a new mode of protein interaction based on multiple simple contacts between one type of amino acid (aromatic) in the disordered protein and another type (positively charged) on the partner protein. Because this mechanism also underlies the ability of the disordered protein to cause cancer, further investigation of this unprecedented mode of protein-protein interaction may open up new avenues for cancer therapy.","Molecular recognition of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) commonly involves specific localized contacts in target-induced disorder and order transitions. However, IDPs remain in a disordered bound state, a phenomenon coined “fuzziness”, characterized by IDP polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity and dynamic ensemble disordered and bound-state conformations. In general, specific biophysical models of fuzzy interactions are lacking. Here, we show that the transcriptional activation domain of the Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein family (EAD) IDP exhibits features of fuzziness, including multiple EAD aromatic chains driving molecular recognition. Considering the prevalent role of cation-π interactions in protein-protein interfaces, we hypothesized that EAD-target binding involves polycation- π contacts in the disordered EAD basic residues of the target. We evaluated this hypothesis in a functional theoretical interrogation of EAD variants. Our experimental effects range from EAD sequence variations, including aromatic number, aromatic density, and charge perturbations, support the cation–pi� model. Moreover, the activity trends observed were captured in a coarse-grained EAD chain model corresponding to an analytical model based on interaction between EAD aromatics and surface cations of the generic globular target. Our results provide a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition of polyvalent IDPs."

In neuroscience, evidence suggests that memory brain regions, such as the hippocampus, are involved in imagining novel situations. We therefore hypothesized that the hippocampus might be critical for evaluating outcomes that we need to imagine. This is typically the case in intertemporal choices, where immediate rewards are considered against future gratifications (e.g., a beer now or a bottle of champagne a week from now). Previous investigations have implicated the dorsal prefrontal cortex brain region in resisting immediate rewards. Here we manipulated the mode of presentation (text or picture), such that options were represented either in simulation or in perception systems. Functional neuroimaging data confirmed that hippocampal activity lends a preference to choosing simulated options (irrespective of time), whereas dorsal prefrontal cortex brain activity supports the preference for delayed options (irrespective of presentation mode). Structural neuroimaging in healthy subjects and in patients with brain atrophy, due to Alzheimer's disease (with hippocampal damage) or Fronto-Temporal Dementia (with damage to the prefrontal cortex), further demonstrated the critical implication of the hippocampus. Individuals with higher neuronal density in the hippocampus, but not in the dorsal prefrontal cortex, were more likely to choose future rewards that have to be mentally simulated.","The hippocampus plays an important role in the decision making process. In this study, we developed a novel paradigm to assess the impact of hippocampus structure function on the propensity to favor imagined outcomes in the context of intertemporal choices.

We compared the simulation process with temporal labels keeping in constant presentation mode. Behavioral data showed that subjects who imagined future options had greater details rated likeable than subjects assigning higher values of simulated options. Structural MRI data suggested that grey matter density was a significant predictor of hippocampus activation, and that patients with hippocamp atrophy and Alzheimer disease, such as those with Fronto-Temporal Dementia, were more inclined to favor options required for mental simulation. We conclude that the hippocampus-mediated simulation plays a critical role in providing motivation to pursue goals in the present senses."

Genetic defects in components of this dystrophin complex are responsible for many forms of muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy. C. elegans possesses the dystrophin complex and mutations in its components cause muscular defects, indicating that the dystrophin complex has an evolutionary conserved role in muscle. Accumulating evidence in mammals indicates that dystrophic muscle exhibits an abnormal calcium homeostasis. It is not clear how defects in the dystrophin complex are linked to calcium homeostasis, however. In a C. elegans genetic study we found that a novel adaptor protein links the dystrophin complex to a calcium-sensitive potassium channel that mediates muscle inactivation. We further demonstrated that both the dystrophin complex and the adaptor protein localize the potassium channel in a close proximity to a muscle-activating calcium channel. This arrangement ensures that calcium increases accompanied by muscle activation are coupled to muscle inactivation. Defects in the dystrophin complex or the adaptor disrupt the localization of the potassium channel, thereby resulting in prolonged muscle activation and calcium ion increases. Our study provides a mechanism by which the dystrophin complex regulates cellular signaling and muscle excitability.","Dysstrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) is a protein complex that is responsible for a variety of pathological conditions including muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, and vasospasm.

To this end, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions and simulation tools are indispensable. The choice of the objective function to be used for simulating genome-scale metabolic models is dependent on the biological context and one of the most relevant parameters for successful modeling. Formulation of the intended objective function often requires the use of multiple fluxes, e.g. the sum of fluxes through ATP-producing reactions. We demonstrate that the existing tools confound biological interpretation of the simulations due to undesired dependence on the representation of stoichiometry and propose a new tool – Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl). MiMBl allows casting of the desired biological objective functions into linear optimization models and gives consistent simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations. We demonstrate relevance of MiMBl for addressing biological questions through improved predictions of genetic interactions within the yeast metabolic network. Genetic interactions imply functional relationship between the genes and therefore allow assessing different hypotheses for the underlying biological principles. MiMBl explains several of the genetic interactions as outcome of flux re-routing for minimal metabolite turnover adjustments.","Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a comprehensive structural framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships in flux simulations. However, the solution space of the metabolic flux state in a cell typically requires large optimization-based approaches that are necessary for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function optimization algorithms are directly linked to the biological hypothesis underlying the model and the relevant parameters for successful modeling. In this study, we propose a new method, Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl), that decouples artifacts from the stoichiometry representation of the formulation of desired objective functions, casting objective functions on metabolite turnovers and fluxes. By simulating perturbed metabolic networks, we demonstrate that the use of stoichiometric representation independent algorithms are fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results and biological interpretation."

Yeast RAD9 was the first DNA damage checkpoint gene identified. The genetic tools available in this model system allow to address relevant questions to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the Rad9 biological function. By chromatin-binding and domain-swapping experiments, we found that Rad9 is recruited into DNA both in unperturbed and in DNA–damaging conditions, and we identified the molecular determinants required for such interaction. Moreover, the extent of chromatin-bound Rad9 is regulated during the cell cycle and influences its role in checkpoint activation. In fact, the checkpoint function of Rad9 in G1 cells is solely mediated by its interaction with modified histones, while in M phase it occurs through an additional scaffold protein, named Dpb11. Productive Rad9-Dpb11 interaction in M phase requires Rad9 phosphorylation by CDK1, and we identified the Ser11 residue as the major CDK1 target. The model of Rad9 action that we are presenting can be extended to other eukaryotic organisms, since Rad9 and Dpb11 have been conserved through evolution from yeast to mammalian cells.","DNA damage is a major cause of disease in humans and animals, and it is important to understand how DNA damage triggers the cell cycle. In this study, we show that the DNA damage-dependent Rad9 chromatin association is required for the effective DNA damage response in the cell. The activation of the chromatin by DNA damage promoted histone modifications that create docking sites for Rad9 recruitment, allowing checkpoint activation. We also show that Rad53 phosphorylation is dependent on BRCT-directed Rad9 oligomerization; however, the crosstalk molecular determinants of its functional significance are poorly understood. Here, we report that in the G1 and M phases of cell cycle, constitutive DNA damage and-mediated Rad9-chromatin association require BRCT domains. In G1 cells, GST and FKBP dimerization motifs substitute for the BRCT domain to promote the recruitment of DNA, which supports Rad9 checkpoint function. In fact, a parallel pathway, independent of histone modification and governed by CDK1 activity, allows checkpoint activation in absence of Rad9 and chromatin binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Rad3 activation is bypassed by Dpb11, allowing Rad53 activation bypassing the requirement of the histone branch."

In its acute phase, the disease has unspecific and mild symptoms, whereas in the chronic phase infected individuals might develop severe cardiomyopathy. For many years, different cell types have been under investigation as alternatives for the treatment of several diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are one of these cell types. As our understanding of MSC biology increases, their properties might be explored in different disease contexts. Since Chagas disease is characterized by intense inflammation and one of the key properties of MSC is the modulation of the immune system, our work investigated the effect of injecting MSC in a mouse model of Chagas disease. Our results show that MSC improved the control of parasite burden and cardiac inflammation, leading to the prevention of cardiac dilation.","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi), is a complex disease that is endemic in Central and South America. The gathering interest increases in non-vectorial forms of transmission, especially in developed countries. The objective of this work was to investigate whether adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) alter the course of disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. ASC was injected intraperitoneally 3 days post-infection (dpi). Tracking bioluminescence showed that cells remained in the abdominal cavity 9 days after injection and migrated into the abdominal subcutaneous fat, the early parasite reservoir. ASC-treated mice showed a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, followed by a decrease in cardiac tissue inflammation, and parasitism and fibrosis at 30 dpi. At this time point, analyses of cytokine release from cells isolated from the heart and exposed to T. cruzi antigens indicated an anti-inflammatory response. In parallel, splenocytes from the ASC group released higher levels of IL-10. At 60 dpi, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the right ventricular (RV) dilation was prevented by ASC-treatment mice. Our results suggest that the injection of ASC early in the course to infection prevents RV remodeling and modulation of immune responses."

From April to September 2009, countries in temperate regions of the Southern hemisphere experienced large epidemics of H1N1pdm during their winter season, with the new virus quickly becoming the predominant circulating influenza strain. We use mathematical modelling to analyse H1N1pdm epidemiological data from 8 southern hemisphere countries. We aim at understanding better the factors which may have influenced virus transmission in these countries. We find that transmissibility of the virus was relatively low compared with previous influenza pandemics, largely because of strong pre-existing age-dependent susceptibility to the virus (older people being less susceptible to infection, perhaps due to pre-existing immunity). We suggest that population demography had a strong impact on the virus spread and that higher transmission rates occurred in countries having a younger population. Our results highlight the requirement to use age-structured models for the analysis of influenza epidemics and support the need for country-specific analyses to inform the design of control policies for pandemic mitigation.","The 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus was introduced outside of a typical influenza season, and the Southern hemisphere countries experienced a single wave of transmission during the 2009 winter season. This provides a unique opportunity to compare the spread of a single virus in different countries and study factors influencing transmission. We estimate the transmission characteristics of H1H1pdm in five Southern Hemisphere countries/states: Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa, and Victoria (Australia). We also estimate the reproduction numbers, R0, empirically derived from country- epidemics' early exponential phase, positively associated with the proportion of children in populations (p  =  0.004). We fitted a dynamic age-structured model of influenza transmission to available incidence data from each country independently, and simultaneously, in countries simultaneously. Our results indicate that the differences in transmission are partly due to differences in population demography."

Virus spreads from infected cells to surrounding uninfected host cells to develop infection through cell-free and cell-cell transmission routes. Understanding the spread of resistant virus is important for the development of novel antiviral strategies to prevent and treat antiviral resistance. Here, we characterize the spread of resistant viruses and its impact for emergence and prevention of resistance using HCV as a model system. Our results show that cell-cell transmission is the main transmission route for antiviral resistant HCV strains and is crucial for the maintenance of infection. Monoclonal antibodies or small molecules targeting HCV entry factors are effective in inhibiting the spread of resistant HCV in cell culture models and thus should be evaluated clinically for prevention and treatment of HCV resistance. Combination of inhibitors targeting viral entry and clinically used direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) prevents antiviral resistance and leads to viral eradication in cell culture models. Collectively, the investigation provides a new strategy for prevention of viral resistance to antiviral agents.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted from hepatocytes to neighboring hepatocytes via direct cell-cell transfer. Cell-cell transmission has been shown to play an important role in viral persistence allowing evasion of neutralizing antibodies. However, the role of HCV cell-cells in antiviral resistance is unknown. Aiming to address this question, we investigated the phenotype of the HCV strains exhibiting resistance to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in a state-of-the-art model system. We found that in the genotype 2 model of the virus, cell-cells are the main route of viral spread and DAA-resistant HCV infection. We also found that blocking the virus from infection by host-targeted entry inhibitors (HTEIs) was highly effective in inhibiting viral dissemination and the rapid elimination of resistant HCV in the cell culture model. In conclusion, our work provides evidence that cell-Cells are an important player in the dissemination and maintenance of resistant variants in cell culture models. Blocking virus from infected cells prevents the emergence of drug resistance and persistent viral infection including resistance to HCV DAAs."

A complex cellular pathway involving the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is typically required for the loading of peptides onto HLA class I molecules, and for effective anti-viral immunity mediated by cytotoxic T cells. Many viruses encode inhibitors of TAP as a means to evade anti-viral immunity by cytotoxic T cells. In humans, there are three sets of genes encoding HLA class I molecules, which are the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genes. These genes are highly variable, with thousands of allelic variants in human populations. Most individuals typically express two variants of each gene, one inherited from each parent. We demonstrate that about 15% of tested HLA-B allotypes have higher resistance to viral inhibitors of TAP or deficiency of TAP, compared to other HLA-B variants. HLA-B allotypes that are more resistant to TAP inhibition are expected to induce stronger CD8+ T cell responses against pathogens that inhibit TAP. Thus, unconventional TAP-independent assembly pathways are broadly prevalent among HLA-B variants. Such pathways provide mechanisms to effectively combat viruses that evade the conventional TAP-dependent HLA-B assembly pathway.","The major histocompatibility complex class (MHC-) molecules present antigenic peptides in CD8+ T cells, an important natural killer (NK) cell immune surveillance against infections and cancers. MHC- molecules are assembled in a complex assembly pathway in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cells. Peptides are present in cytosol cells and transported to the ER transporter associated antigen processing (TAP) by the peptide-loading complex (PLC). In the ER, peptides assembled in the MHC–molecular assembly pathway are frequently targeted by viruses, in order to evade host immunity. In addition, viruses encode inhibitors of TAP, which are thought to be the central source of peptides assembly. Here, we show that HLA-B genes are highly polymorphic, and conceivable variants acquire peptides from TAP-independent pathways, conferring resistance to pathogen-derived inhibitors of the TAP pathway. We broadly assess the expression levels of 27 of 27 frequent HLA B alleles in cells with deficiencies in TAP. Approximately 15% of the tested cells expressed relatively high levels of surface TAP1 and TAP2-deficient cells occur in partially peptide receptive forms of Endoglycosidase H sensitive forms of the cell surface. Synergy of high peptide loading efficiency, broad specificity, and peptides prevalent in unconventional sources, and their intrinsic stability form allows deviations from the conventional pathway. These results suggest that the degree of resistance to TAP inhibition is functionally distinct from the extent to which specific HLA–B allotypes are expressed."

Two transcription factors—GL1 and GL3—have been associated with the initiation of trichome formation; yet only a handful of GL1-GL3–regulated genes have previously been characterized. In this study, we combined expression analyses performed in a number of different genotypes to identify a minimal set of about 500 genes associated with trichome formation. We also used ChIP-chip to identify a set of about 20 genes that are immediate targets of GL3 and GL1. Many more genes are targeted by GL1 or by GL3, likely in cooperation with other bHLH of MYB partners, but not by both GL1 and GL3. As predicted for genes involved in the initiation of epidermal cell fate determination, several of the GL3/GL1 direct targets are expressed early during trichome formation, including the transcription factors MYC1 (bHLH), SCL8 (GRAS), and genes involved in the regulation of the endocycle (SIM and RBR1).

Here I introduce two new genome-wide, pairwise indices for quantifying the propensity of microbial species to interact with each other. The first measure quantifies similarity in genome composition between two microbes. The second measure summarizes the topology of a protein functional association network built for a given pair of microbes and quantifies the fraction of network edges crossing organismal boundaries. I then study the ability of two newly proposed and two previously reported indices to explain variation in microbial co-occurrence. All four measures are significantly correlated with co-occurrence of microbes even when accounting for evolutionary relationships between the species. One of the newly developed indices outperforms previously proposed ones and explains up to 3.5% of the variance in co-occurrence. In summary, the indices described here are able to detect ecological associations between species using only their genomic information; however, additional methods are needed to provide more reliable genomic tools for microbial ecology.","Microbe-microbe interactions are a major determinant of phenotypic properties, largely unknown to the extent to which ecological associations between different species are explained by genome composition. To bridge this gap, we introduce two new genome-wide pairwise measures of microbe–microbe interaction. The first (genomic content similarity index) quantifies the similarity between the genome composition of microbes and the functional association network built by a given pair of microbes, while the second (microbe-macrobe functional association index) summarizes the topology of the functional network. These new indices predict the co-occurrence of reference genomes in 16S-based ecological datasets, accounting for phylogenetic relatedness and taxa. Phylogenetic and relatedness are found to be a strong predictor of ecological associations among microbes, and genome composition is found to explain 10% of the variance in co- occurrence data, while genome composition was found to account for 4% to 4% of variance between co-accurrence and genomic-based indices. These metrics are proposed to explain a larger proportion of variance than previously reported by complex methods that rely on metabolic network comparisons. In summary, our results indicate that microbial genomes contain a detectable signal of organismal ecology, and the methods described in this paper will improve our mechanistic understanding of the interactions between microbe and microbe."

The cellular mechanism of cytokinesis in eukaryotes differs at least between yeasts, plants and animals. So far, it is also not clear whether all mammalian cells follow the same mechanistic rules of cytokinesis. Here, we demonstrate that, depending on the mammalian cell type, two different pathways could result in completion of cytokinesis, a septin-dependent pathway and a distinct mechanism, which does not require septins prevalent in the hematopoietic system. Using multiple conditional knockouts, we demonstrate this cell type specificity in vitro and in vivo, and present evidence for the involvement of cell-type specific alteration of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Our data, together with the previously available septin knockdown data in cancer cell lines, suggest septins as plausible antitumor targets with high therapeutic index due to lack of off-target effects on hematopoiesis.","Cytokinesis terminates mitosis, resulting in separation of sister cells into sister cells. Septins, a conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins, are the absolute requirement for cytokinesis in budding yeast. We show that septin-dependent mammalian cytokineis differs greatly from cell types: genetic loss of a pivotal septin subunit SEPT7 in vivo reveals that septins are indispensable for the cell division of fibroblasts, expendable cells in the hematopoietic system. Septin-independent cells fail to gastrulate, and septin deficient cells exhibit pleiotropic defects in major cytokinetic machinery, including hyperacetylation/stabilization of microtubules and stalled midbody abscission, leading to constitutive multinucleation. We identified the microtubule depolymerizing protein stathmin as a key molecule aiding septin–independent cell division. Stathmin supplementation is sufficient to override septin failure in septin-deficient cells, and we show that knockdown of stathmit makes proliferation of hematoplasts a sensitive septin inhibitor forchlorfenuron."

The consequence is enhanced long-term survival by facilitating persistence and evasion of the host immune system. Salmonella sp., cause severe infections in a range of mammalian hosts and guard themselves with a protective coat, termed the O-antigen. Through genome sequence analyses we found that Salmonella have acquired an unprecedented repertoire of genetic sequences for modifying their O-antigen coat. There is strong evidence that these genetic factors have a dynamic evolutionary history and are spread through the bacterial population by bacteriophage. In addition to this genetic repertoire, we determined that Salmonella can and often do employ stochastic mechanisms for expression of these genetic factors. This means that O-antigen coat diversity can be generated within a Salmonella population that otherwise has a common genome. Our data significantly enhance our appreciation of the genetic and regulatory characteristics underpinning Salmonella O-antigen diversity. The role attributed to bacteriophage in generating this diversity highlights that Salmonella are acquiring an extensive repertoire of O-antigen modifying traits that may enhance the pathogen's ability to persist and cause disease in mammalian hosts. Such genetic traits may make useful markers for defining new epidemiological and diagnostic tools.","Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori serovars are the most common Gram-negative pathogens in the United States. Salmonellae are the causative agent of a wide range of infectious diseases, including pneumonia, typhoid fever, and diarrhea. The Gram-positive pathogens have evolved a variety of strategies to evade the host immune response, including the use of lipopolysaccharide as an antigenic factor. In this study, we show that lipopolycharide diversity is generally associated with sequence variation in the expression of the glucosyltransferase (gtr) operon, which provides structural heterogeneity by adding additional sugars to the O-antigen component. We also show that Gtr-mediated modification generates significant intra- and inter-strain phenotypic diversity, which is fundamental for assessing Salmonelli strain variability."

Due to the intensive use of praziquantel, some reports of drug resistance have emerged. Thus it is important to search for new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment disease. This research showed that epiisopiloturine, an imidazole alkaloid extracted from the leaves of Pilocarpus microphylus, has activity against S. mansoni in vivo. This material is produced as a by-product of an existing commercial process, and thus can be produced in large quantities at relatively low cost.

Among the nonstructural proteins of enteroviruses or picornaviruses, protein 2CATPase is the most conserved and complex but the least understood. On the basis of sequence analyses, this protein has been predicted as a putative superfamily 3 (SF3) helicase that supposedly plays a pivotal role in enteroviral RNA replication. However, attempts to determine the helicase activity associated with 2CATPase have been unsuccessful. We found that eukaryotically expressed EV71 or CAV16 2CATPase does possess an ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that 3′→5′ unwinds RNA helices like other SF3 helicases; surprisingly, it also functions as an RNA chaperone that remodels RNA structures in an ATP-independent manner. Moreover, we determined the domain requirements for these two RNA remodeling activities associated with 2CATPase and provide both in vitro and cellular evidence of their potential roles during viral RNA replication. Additionally, our study provides the first evidence that RNA helicase and chaperoning activities can be integrated within one protein, thereby introducing an extended view of RNA remodeling proteins.","RNA helicases and chaperones are major classes of RNA remodeling proteins, which function to remodel RNA structures and/or RNA-protein interactions, and are required for many aspects of RNA metabolism. Although RNA helicases/chaperones have been predicted and have been identified, their in vitro functions and viral life cycle remain largely elusive. Enteroviruses are a large group of positive-stranded RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family, which includes numerous important human pathogens. Here, we report the nonstructural protein 2CATPase enterovirus 71 (EV71), a major causative pathogen of hand-foot-to-mouth disease, which is regarded as an important neurotropic disease. EV71 functions as an RNA helicase that unwinds RNA helices in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner, and that this RNA chaperone destabilizes helices bidirectionally and facilitates strand annealing and complex RNA structure formation independently of ATP. Our findings demonstrate that RNA-chaperoning activities are associated with the activity of the RNA-coupled protein 2CTPase in EV71. Furthermore, our study provides in vitro cellular evidence of potential roles for RNA-encoded RNA helicones in viral RNA replication and virion production."

Recent molecular genetics advances in angiosperms revealed that transcriptional regulation is critical for auxin response. Although auxin response was also observed in charophytes, a class of green algae related to land plants, and bryophytes, little is known how plants acquired auxin signaling components during evolution. Recently, it was reported that a filamentous charophycean alga, Klebsormidium flaccidum, does not have auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation, suggesting its evolution around land adaptation of plants. Here, we revealed that a liverwort species, Marchantia polymorpha, has a simplified but complete auxin-mediated transcription mechanism compared with other land plant species. Despite the minimal auxin system, M. polymorpha exhibited pleiotropic auxin responses in morphogenesis including roles in organ differentiation and cell elongation. Phylogenetic and experimental analyses revealed that the three ARF transcription factors in M. polymorpha had different transcriptional activities and interacted in various combinations with different affinities. This suggests that the auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation was established in the common ancestor of land plants, and might be correlated with the change in body plans at this time in the evolution of land plants.","The plant hormone auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. Recent progress in Arabidopsis has provided a scheme for auxin receptors, TIR1/AFBs, to target transcriptional co-repressors, AUX/IAAs, and degradation, allowing ARFs to regulate the transcription of auxin responsive genes. However, the mechanism of the auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation is not considered to have evolved in the time plants adapted to the land. Here, we show that the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, which belongs to the earliest diverging lineage of land plants, belongs to a conserved lineage of plant hormone receptors. We show that MpIAA and ARFs have different transcriptional activities, corresponding to the phylogenetic classifications of these two lineages. Our study provides evidence that pleiotropic auxin responses are achieved by a minimal set of auxins signaling factors, suggesting that auxin signaling factors may be a key invention to establish body plans for land plants."

It is used within cells to regulate many essential processes and, because of this, its cellular concentration is tightly controlled. To change cellular calcium levels, cells use calcium transport proteins. These proteins can alter calcium concentration by moving calcium into or out of the cell or specialised calcium storage compartments within the cell. We know little about how single-celled apicomplexan parasites, including Plasmodium (the causal agent of malaria) and Toxoplasma (the causal agent of toxoplasmosis), regulate their calcium levels. Here, we have demonstrated that removing apicomplexan genes for a protein that exchanges calcium for protons across membranes (a Ca2+/H+ exchanger) and a member of the cation exchanger (CAX) family, does not affect the survival of parasites during those stages when they live within host cells. It is, however, lethal for the mouse malaria P. berghei when the parasite is free living within its mosquito vector. When we removed calcium from around the parasites at this stage they were able to develop normally, suggesting that the protein provides a mechanism for the parasite to tolerate environmental calcium. Learning how this calcium transport protein impacts on the development of apicomplexan parasites may lead to the development of novel anti-parasitic interventions.","Plasmodium falciparum (PfCAX) is a parasitic protozoan parasite that causes malaria in humans and other animals. It has been shown that Ca2+ contributes to myriad important cellular processes in many organisms, including apicomplexans, Toxoplasma, and Plasmodia berghei. However, the mechanisms of its homeostatic control are not well understood. Here, we show that PbCAX, a member of the cation exchanger family, plays a key role in the control of the parasite in asexual blood stage parasites. We show that T. gondii and P.berghei parasites are able to tolerate knock-outs of genes in TgCAX in the asexual and blood stages, respectively. We also demonstrate that TGFCAX is able to regulate the expression of knock-out genes in the parasite during the development of female gametocytes/gametes, zygotes and ookinetes. These results support the hypothesis that the parasite is unable to tolerate the knock-off genes in PpCAX during the developmental stages."

Demographic data from 257 children showed that the number of schoolchildren gradually decreased as their ages increased in all the three schools. The sex ratio was proportional in the urban school until primary level three, after which the number of female pupils gradually decreased, whereas in the private school, sexes were proportionally distributed even in higher classes.

Early animal studies have identified learning mechanisms that are based on reward and punishment such that animals tend to avoid actions that lead to punishment whereas rewarded actions are reinforced. It is an open question how sensory information is processed by the brain in order to learn and perform rewarding behaviors. In this article, we propose a learning system that combines the autonomous extraction of important information from the sensory input with reward-based learning. The extraction of salient information is learned by exploiting the temporal continuity of real-world stimuli. A subsequent neural circuit then learns rewarding behaviors based on this representation of the sensory input. We demonstrate in two control tasks that this system is capable of learning complex behaviors on raw visual input.","Humans are able to learn complex behaviors based on a massive stream of sensory information from different modalities.

However, the algorithms for reward-based learning are applicable to dimensionality of state-space and sufficiently small structure to be sufficiently simple.

The system is composed of a hierarchical slow feature analysis (SFA) network preprocessing and a simple neural network trained based on rewards. We demonstrate that the system is able to perform demanding reinforcement learning tasks in a time comparable to the time needed for explicit and highly informative low-dimensional state-of-space representation given instead of high-dividing visual input. The learning speed of the proposed architecture task is similar to that found in experimental studies in rats. Our study supports the hypothesis that slowness learning is an important unsupervised learning principle utilized to form efficient state representations of behavioral learning."

These base-pairing interactions are stabilizing, and the RNA will tend to fold in a particular way to maximize stability. Consider some nucleotide sequence that optimally folds into some structure in isolation; if this sequence is now embedded inside a larger sequence, then either the original structure will be a robust subcomponent of the larger folded structure, or it will be disrupted due to new interactions between the original sequence and the surrounding sequence. We explore this property of context robustness of structure and in particular define the property of “self containment” to describe intrinsic context robustness—i.e., the tendency for certain sequences to be structurally robust in many different sequence contexts. Self containment turns out to be a strong characteristic of a class of RNAs called microRNAs, whose biogenesis process depends on the maintenance of structural robustness. This finding will be useful in future efforts to characterize novel miRNAs, as well as in understanding the regulation and evolution of noncoding functional RNAs as modular units.","RNA molecules tend to adopt a folded conformation between the bases of a single strand, resulting in a so-called secondary structure. The secondary structure of a particular substring of a functional RNA depends on the surrounding sequence. However, RNAs and microRNAs retain specific structures in biogenesis, which involves extraction of the substructure from a larger structural context, whereas functional RNAs are composed of fusion of independent substructures. Our observations raise the question of whether particular functional RNA substructure are selected for the invariance of the secondary structure within the surrounding nucleotide context. We define the property of self containment, which is the tendency of an RNA sequence to robustly adopt optimal secondary structure regardless of whether it exists in isolation of a longer sequence or arbitrary nucleotide content. We measured the degree and self containment of miRNA stem loops and found that these stem loops exhibit high self containment. Our analysis revealed a trend of higher self containment clustered with conserved miRNAs, suggesting that high self-compression is a characteristic characteristic of novel RNAs acquiring new genomic contexts. Our results suggest that self containment arises from selection for robustness to perturbations, invariance to biogenesis and modular composition of structural function."

However, most methods for interpreting data from X-ray crystallography focus on building a single structure of the protein, which limits the potential for biological insights. Here we introduce an improved algorithm for using crystallographic data to model these multiple conformations that addresses two previously overlooked types of protein backbone flexibility: peptide flips and glycine movements. The method successfully models known examples of these types of multiple conformations, and also identifies new cases that were previously unrecognized but are well supported by the experimental data. For example, we discover glycine-driven peptide flips in the inhibitor-gating “flaps” of the drug target HIV protease that were not modeled in the original structures. Automatically modeling “hidden” multiple conformations of proteins using our algorithm may help drive biomedically relevant insights in structural biology pertaining to, e.g., drug discovery for HIV–1 protease and other therapeutic targets.","Proteins have different conformations in their native ensemble to perform their functions. Crystal structures obtained from high-resolution X-ray diffraction data reflect heterogeneity in the spatial temporal conformational average. The movement of natively populated alternative conformations is critical for characterizing molecular mechanisms, but it is challenging to identify conformations with electron density maps. Alternative chain conformations are generally separated from distinct rotameric conformations, and alternative backbone conformations overlap atomic positions. Here, we describe a new modeling program called qFit that uses mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to evaluate an extremely large number of combinations of sidechain conformers and backbone fragments to locally explain electron density. We find that peptide flips in alternative glycine conformations occur in stereotypical clusters of enriched glycine residues at n+1 position. These potential insights have uncovered new peptide flip in glycine protein conformations exemplified by HIV protease, which has different inhibitors associated with peptides flips in “flap” regions adjacent to the inhibitor binding site. These results provide new insights into the dynamics of the structure-function relationship and will help drive new design strategies for inhibitors of biomedically important systems."

To secure the long-term global control of the disease, it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying the interactions of drugs and drug candidates with the causative agents as well as resistance potentially arising from use of the compounds. We demonstrated here a metabolic enzymatic cascade dependent on a host-pathogen interaction that determines potency against T. brucei of a series of benzoxaborole compounds. More importantly, this pathway represents a metabolic interaction network between host and pathogen, illuminating an important perspective on understanding mechanism of action.","The development of benzoxaborole-based chemistry gave rise to a collection of compounds with great potential for targeting diverse infectious diseases, including human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a devastating neglected tropical disease. However, medicinal development is largely restricted to the mechanism of action (MoA) of pathogenic kinetoplastids. We have adopted a multidisciplinary approach, combining a high-throughput forward genetic screen and functional group focused on chemical biological, structural biology and biochemical analyses, to tackle complex MoAs of the benzoxabole family of trypanosoma brucei. We describe an oxidative enzymatic pathway composed of a host semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase and the trypanolomal aldehyde dehydrogenase TbALDH3. We show that the sequential reactions of the pathway serve as a key underlying mechanism for activating series of 4-aminomethylphenoxy-benoxaboroles potent against trypanocides; methylamine parental compounds are transformed into intermediate aldehyd metabolites, carboxylate metabolites, and other effective forms. Overall, our work proposes a novel drug activation mechanism dependent on host parasite metabolism and primary amine containing molecules, which can be exploited to improve the therapeutic index of antimicrobial compounds."

Particular attention is typically given to protein-coding changes often neglecting the potential impact of exonic variants on RNA splicing. Here, we used the exon 10 of MLH1, a gene implicated in hereditary cancer, as a model system to assess the prevalence of RNA splicing mutations among all single-nucleotide variants identified in a given exon by using minigene-based assays. Our study revealed an unexpected high proportion of splicing mutations in MLH1 exon 10 mostly affecting potential exonic splicing regulatory elements (ESRs), which are typically difficult to predict by using in silico tools. We then used five experimental datasets (MLH1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CFTR and NF1) to evaluate the predictive power of 3 in silico approaches recently described for pinpointing ESR-mutations. What’s more, besides predicting which exonic variants affect splicing, ΔtESRseq and ΔHZEI values also indicated the direction and severity of the induced splicing defects. In contrast, the ΔΨ-based approach did not show a compelling predictive power. Our data indicates that exonic splicing mutations are more prevalent than currently appreciated and that they can now be predicted by using bioinformatics methods. These findings have implications for all genetically-caused diseases.","The identification of a causal mutation is essential for molecular diagnosis and clinical management of genetic disorders.

Significant associations between markers and disease are then used as evidence to implicate biological intermediates and pathways likely to be involved in disease aetiology.

Our idea is to construct allelic scores that explain greater proportions of the variance in biological intermediates than single markers, and then use these scores to data mine genome-wide association studies. We show how allelic scores derived from known variants as well as allelic scores derived from hundreds of thousands of genetic markers across the genome explain significant portions of the variance in body mass index, levels of C-reactive protein, and LDLc cholesterol, and many of these scores show expected correlations with disease.

They also perform a range of immune modulatory functions which regulate the immune response to pathogens, ensuring that the protective inflammatory response is not exacerbated and that post-infection repair mechanisms are initiated. We identified a novel family of molecules secreted by medically-important helminth pathogens (termed helminth defence molecules; HDMs) that exhibit striking structural and biochemical similarities to the HDPs. To further investigate the extent of this similarity, we have performed a comparative functional study between several well characterized, anti-microbial, mammalian HDPs and a series of parasite-derived peptides. The parasite HDMs displayed immune modulatory properties that were similar to their HDP homologs in mammals, but possessed no antimicrobial or cytotoxic activity. We propose that HDMs of these helminth pathogens underwent specific adaptation, losing their anti-microbial activity but retaining their ability to regulate the immune responses of their mammalian hosts. This absence of cytotoxicity and retention of immune-modulatory activity offers an opportunity to design novel immunotherapeutics derived from the HDMs which could be used to combat destructive inflammatory responses associated with microbial infection and immune-related disorders.","Host defence peptides (HDPs) are secreted by helminth parasites (helminth defence molecules; HDMs) and have similar structural and biochemical characteristics to mammalian HDPs.

In the Brazilian Amazon, Chagas disease has been recognized as an emerging problem. There are few studies exploring the genetic and biological framework of stocks of T. cruzi from the Western Brazilian Amazon, where Chagas disease has a profile of lower morbidity and mortality, appearing mainly in the chronic latent form. Here, we carried out the biological characterization in mice of T. cruzi isolates belonging to TcI and TcIV DTUs from the State of Amazonas, Western Brazilian Amazon. T. cruzi stocks belonging to TcI and TcIV DTUs from Brazilian Amazon are divergent in terms of biological and medical properties in mice, with a higher virulence for the latter DTU as revealed by several biological parameters. Results strongly support the working hypothesis that biological differences are proportional to the evolutionary divergence among the DTUs, and highlight the need to take into account the phylogenetic diversity of T. cruzi natural stocks circulating in the emergent areas for Chagas disease in all applied studies dealing with clinical diversity of Chagas disease, immunology, diagnosis, prognosis, and drug and vaccine trials.","Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. It is endemic in the Amazon region of Brazil, and is caused by a parasite that is transmitted by T. cruzi parasites.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the parasite's clonal structure has a major impact on biological and medical properties. Seventeen parameters were assayed in mice infected with 14 T.cruzi strains belonging to the DTU TCI and 11 strains typed by TCIV.

Here, we take advantage of recent technical and methodological advances to examine the role of common mitochondrial DNA variants in several complex diseases. By examining over 50,000 individuals, from 11 different diseases we show that mitochondrial DNA variants can both increase or decrease an individual's risk of disease, replicating and expanding upon several previously reported studies. Moreover, by analysing several large disease groups in tandem, we are able to show a commonality of association, with the same mitochondrial DNA variants associated with several distinct disease phenotypes. These shared genetic associations implicate a shared underlying functional effect, likely changing cellular energy, which manifests as distinct phenotypes. Our study confirms the important role that mitochondrial DNA variation plays on complex traits and additionally supports the utility of a GWAS-based approach for analysing mitochondrial genetics.","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is highly polymorphic at the population level, and specific mtDNA variants affect mitochondrial function.

IgM ELISA was superior to commercial IgG ELISAs in detecting rising IgG titers in acute phase sera collected later on the day of onset symptoms, and significantly improved diagnostic analytical sensitivity compared to commercially available ELISA tests.

Physicists and mathematicians found that, although in general, one cannot hear the shape of a drum, many of its properties, such as its area and perimeter, can be ""heard"". Here, we ask whether the type of interaction being represented in a network can be ""seen"" when inspecting its shape—for example, whether we can distinguish networks reporting interactions between plants and their pollinators (mutually beneficial) from those representing interactions between plants and their herbivores (beneficial only to the herbivores). We show that many types of nonbiological networks can be easily separated based on structural properties, whereas determining the type of interaction represented by an ecological networks is harder. We therefore turn this problem into a challenge for the scientific community. We argue that solving this problem would greatly benefit the field, and we discuss what the consequences of a failure might be.","Ecologists have been compiling ecological networks for more than a century, detailing interactions between species in a variety of ecosystems. To achieve this goal, they have built networks of mutualistic (e.g. pollination, seed dispersal) and antagonistic (i.e. herbivory, parasitism) interactions. However, the type of interaction represented is believed to be reflected in the structure of the network, and differ substantially from mutualistic and antagonist networks. Here, we show that it is not possible to determine the type interaction represented by a network based solely on its structure. We find that, while it is easy to separate different kinds of nonecological networks, ecological networks display structural variation, making it difficult to distinguish mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. We frame the problem as a challenge for community scientists interested in computational biology and machine learning. We discuss features of a good solution that possess obstacles that need to overcome to achieve the goal."

These fusion protein complexes function autonomously to co-ordinately regulate virus–cell attachment and subsequent membrane merger. In contrast, the reovirus Fusion-Associated Small Transmembrane (FAST) proteins are the only example of virus-encoded cellular fusogens, specifically designed to mediate cell–cell rather than virus–cell membrane fusion. In view of their small size, it was unclear if, or how, the FAST proteins are responsible for promoting the membrane attachment and close apposition stages of the fusion reaction. We now show that the FAST proteins have specifically evolved to function as the fusion component in a biphasic cell–cell fusion reaction, where the membrane attachment and membrane merger stages represent two distinct, uncoupled phases. Exploiting cadherins as surrogate adhesins, the FAST proteins have retained within their rudimentary structures the minimal determinants required to convert pre-existing adherens junctions into sites of cell–cell membrane fusion. These results raise the interesting possibility that other, yet to be identified cellular fusion proteins may resemble the FAST proteins, using separate adhesins and less complex fusion proteins in a similar biphasic membrane fusion reaction.","Reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins function as virus-encoded cellular fusogens, mediating efficient cell–cell virus–cell membrane fusion.

We also show that surrogate adhesion proteins, specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane fusion, are able to efficiently utilize adhesins and fusion reaction.

Though often considered genomic parasites, these elements also occasionally create novel genes that prove beneficial to the host, a process called 'domestication'. Here, we describe the evolution of a gene, L1TD1, which is derived from the protein-coding regions of the L1 mobile element family. We show that L1TD1 was born in the common ancestor of placental mammals. L1TD1 expression in stem cells and its requirement to maintain the pluripotent state of human embryonic stem cells suggested it might have been originally domesticated for such a pluripotency role. We find that L1TD1's evolution does not fit with the predictions of this model; in fact, L1TD1 has rapidly evolved in primates and mice and has been lost several times in mammals. We suggest an alternate model that L1TD1 was born as a means to defend genomes against transposable elements, perhaps L1 itself. We propose that following this initial domestication, L1TD1 later became incorporated into pluripotency programs in some mammalian lineages.","Mammalian genomes comprise active fossilized retroelements. This obligate requirement for retroelement integration affords host genomes the opportunity to ‘domesticate’ retroelement genes for their purpose, leading to important innovations in genome defense during placentation. In mammals, exaptations involve retroviruses, L1TD1 is a gene known as a domesticated gene protein-coding sequence entirely derived from LINE-1 (L1) retroelement. We show that the L1TL1 gene has been shown to play an important role in pluripotency maintenance during mammalian evolution. We hypothesize that L1TB1 originally evolved as a common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost pseudogenized multiple times in mammalian evolution, including during primate and mouse evolution. Our study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology, and suggests that domesticated genes adopt different functions in different lineages."

Although QTL map-based cloning is a powerful method, it is time-consuming, and the QTLs underlying P efficiency in soybeans have not been identified. Combining linkage and association analyses, we identified a highly significant region on chromosome 8, qPE8, which is associated with soybean P efficiency. Gene expression and plant transformation experiments indicated that the gene GmACP1 within qPE8 affects P efficiency. A haplotype survey of GmACP1 identified 10 haplotypes that explained 33% of the variation in P efficiency. The discovery of the optimal haplotype of GmACP1 will improve the accuracy of selecting soybeans with higher P efficiencies and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying P efficiency in plants.","Phosphorus (P) is essential for living cells in all organisms, but low-P stress is a major factor constraining plant growth and yield worldwide.

The disease is caused by a series of mutations in the Amyloid protein precursor (APP) and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) genes, which cause autosomal dominant forms of early-on-Autism. These genes were identified in the 1990s, but variant classification remains a challenge, highlighting the need to colligate mutations in a large series. In this study, we report a novel update (2012–2016) of genetic screening in 28 French hospitals from 1993 onwards, bringing the total number of families identified mutations to n = 170. We screened 129 sporadic cases of Alzheimer disease and age onset (AOO) for the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations and identified 53 novel AD-AEOAD families. Of the 129 cases screened, 17 carried the APP mutation 1 and 17 carried APP duplication (13%). Thirteen mutations (12 and 13) were found in familial sporadic cases previously unreported. The 53 mutation carriers were available in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and 46 (87%) CSF biomarkers were normal ranges. These findings suggest that a nonnegligible fraction of the PSEN 1 mutations occurs de novo, which is high importance for genetic counseling."

An emerging insight is that changes in behavior are associated with massive changes in gene expression in the brain, but we know relatively little about how these changes are regulated. One important class of gene regulators are transcription factors (TF), proteins that orchestrate the expression of tens to thousands of genes. We discovered that ultraspiracle (USP), a TF previously known primarily for its role in development, regulates behavioral change in the honey bee; and we show that USP causes behaviorally related changes in gene expression by mediating responses to an endocrine regulator, juvenile hormone. We present evidence that these effects on gene expression occur through combinatorial interactions between USP and other TFs, and that these hormonally related transcriptional networks are preserved between two tissues with causal roles in behavioral plasticity: the brain and the fat body, a peripheral nutrient-sensing organ. These results suggest that behavior is subserved by complex interactions between genes and gene networks, occurring both in the brain and in peripheral tissues. More generally our results suggest that molecular systems biology is a promising paradigm by which to understand the mechanistic basis for behavior.","Behavior is one of the most dynamic animal phenotypes, modulated by a variety of internal external stimuli. Behavioral differences are associated with large-scale changes in gene expression, but little is known about how these changes are regulated. Here we show that a transcription factor (TF), ultraspiracle (usp; insect homolog of Retinoid X Receptor) is working in complex transcriptional networks to regulate behavioral plasticity associated with changes in transcriptional expression. We show that the transcription factor USP is involved in maturation-related transcriptional changes in fat bodies and mediates transcriptional responses to juvenile hormone. We also show that changes in USP transcriptional activity are mediated by changes in the USP genomic binding sites, which are enriched by USP binding sites. Our results suggest that the regulation of gene expression is likely determined by combinatorial interactions between USP TFs and cis-regulatory motifs that enriched USP-binding sites."

Pathology coincides with egg production, which is started upon pairing of the dioeciously living adults. A constant pairing contact is required to induce mitoses and differentiation processes in the female leading to the development of the gonads. Although long known, the molecular processes controlling gonad development or egg-production in schistosomes or other platyhelminths are largely unknown. Using an established in vitro-culture system and specific, chemical inhibitors we have obtained first evidence in previous studies for the participation of signal transduction processes playing essential roles in controlling mitoses, differentiation and egg production. In the present study we applied combinatory inhibitor treatments combined with subsequent microarray and qPCR analyses and demonstrate for the first time that cooperating Src-Kinase- und TGFβ-signaling pathways control mitoses and egg formation processes. Besides direct evidence for managing transcription of eggshell-forming genes, new target molecules of these pathways were identified. Among these are calcium-associated genes providing a first hint towards a role of this ion for reproduction. Our finding shed first light on the signaling mechanisms controlling egg formation, which is important for life-cycling and pathology.","Schistosome parasites cause schistosomiasis, the most prevalent parasitemias worldwide affecting humans and animals. Female reproduction is essential for female sexual maturation and egg production, which causes pathogenesis. Female maturation involves signaling pathways controlling mitosis and differentiation in gonads. In vitro studies have shown that a Src-specific inhibitor, Herbimycin (Herb), has physiological effects that are suppressed mitoses during egg production paired with females. The Herb target, gonad-specific expressed Src kinase SmTK3, has been identified as a potential target for inhibition of mitosis differentiation. We comparatively analyzed transcriptome profiles of Herb A- and TRIKI-treated females identifying transcriptional targets of Src and kinase TβRI pathways. We show that TRIKI inhibits the expression of several genes involved in eggshell formation. In situ hybridization confirmed transcription genes coding for the calcium sensor hippocalcin, the calcium transporter ORAI-1, and the calcium-binding protein calmodulin-4 in the reproductive system pointing to a role for calcium in parasite reproduction. Functional qPCR results confirmed that the inhibitor is inhibitor- influenced, varying dependence on transcriptional activities of Smp14, Smp48, fs800, and predicted eggshell precursor protein SmTYR1. These results indicate that eggshell-forming pathways are cooperatively operating in a balanced manner to control egg production."

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in those patients. There are several non-invasive methods to assess if a person from general population has a high risk for developing cardiovascular disease, but it is unclear whether they are useful in hemodialysis patients. Here we assessed the ability of patient-specific pulse wave propagation modeling to correctly identify high cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients. We performed pulse wave analysis (PWA) in patients on hemodialysis and in healthy subjects. Recorded peripheral pressure profiles were simultaneously used to inform subject-specific mathematical model of pulse wave propagation. We found that standard PWA-derived biomarkers failed to clearly show the differences between hemodialysis patients and healthy subjects. However, proposed mathematical model of pulse wave propagation identified significantly increased arterial stiffness in HD patients and provided also the major determinants of PWA-derived biomarkers. Our study suggests that current pulse wave analysis based biomarkers can be insufficient to accurately diagnose hemodialysis patients. Proposed patient-specific pulse wave propagation modeling framework may be a new tool to assess the cardiovascular risk in both general and hemodialysis populations.","The risk of cardiovascular associated death in dialysis patients is highest among patients with highest co- morbidities. Improving the identification of patients with the highest cardiovascular risk and design of adequate treatment, is of utmost importance.

In this study, we aimed to provide a framework to precisely dissect information available from non-invasively recorded pulse wave hemodialysis patients. Radial pressure wave profiles were recorded, independent of hemodials, in 35 anuric patients and 32 healthy volunteers. We recorded the subject-specific parameters of the pulse wave propagation model.

Individuals with Cystic Fibrosis and hospital patients are particularly vulnerable to P. aeruginosa infections. This bacterium does not respond to many antibiotics, making these infections difficult to treat. P. aeruginosa can grow as free-floating planktonic cells or as microcolonies known as biofilms. The ability of P. aeruginosa to form biofilms is thought to contribute to their ability to cause chronic infections. The aim of this research was to develop a simple biofilm model of infection using the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The immune system of the fruit fly has similarities with the vertebrate innate immune system. Understanding how P. aeruginosa causes infections in Drosophila will aid in understanding virulence mechanisms in mammals. In this study we show that feeding P. aeruginosa to Drosophila results in a biofilm infection and biofilm infections induced expression of antimicrobial peptide immune response genes in the fly. Using fly survival as a measure of virulence we showed that biofilm infections were less virulent than non-biofilm infections. These results provide novel insight into host-pathogens interactions during P. aeruginosa infection.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing acute chronic infections in susceptible hosts. Chronic infections are thought to be caused by bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are highly structured, multicellular, microbial communities encased in the extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival of the host.

We found that P. auberculosis-causing bacterium, PAO1, was significantly more virulent than PAZHI3, and that the hyperbiofilm strain (PAO1) was more likely to survive in infected flies on day 14 postinfection. Biofilm formation was dependent on the expression of pel exopolysaccharide genes, and the pelB::lux mutant failed to form biofilmms. Our results highlight the importance of the use of the animal model in the understanding of the pathogen interactions between P.

N. fowleri can act as an opportunistic pathogen causing severe brain injury called Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), often in healthy children and young adults. With a fatality rate over 97%, N. fowleri is considered one of the most deadly human pathogens. Despite the fact that precious lives are lost annually, N. fowleri infection is rare and economic incentives to invest in development of anti-PAM drugs by the pharmaceutical industry are lacking. In the absence of economic inducements, drug ‘repurposing’ is a cost effective strategy for re-profiling known drugs for the treatment of neglected diseases. The similarity between pathogenic fungi and free-living amoebae in the sterol biosynthesis pathway encouraged us to assess anti-mycotic drugs, clinically-approved for treatment of a variety of fungal diseases, for anti-Naegleria activity. Carrying out biochemical studies and x-ray-crystallography of the target enzyme, we demonstrated that azole anti-fungal drugs, known as conazoles, disrupt sterol biosynthesis in amoebae by competing with the natural substrate for binding in the active site of the sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51). Disruption of sterol biosynthesis leads to a rapid death of pathogenic amoebae.","Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by Naegleria fowleri, a free-living amoeba that occasionally infects humans.

In the absence of economic inducements to invest in the development of anti-PAM drugs, drug discovery largely relies on drug ‘repurposing’—a cost effective strategy to apply known drugs to treatment of rare neglected diseases. In this work, we systematically assessed the impact of the anti-inflammatory azole drugs, known as conazoles, on sterol biosynthesis and viability in cultured N. fowli and trophozotes. We identified endogenous CYP51 substrate mass spectrometry and analyzed the interactions between the recombinant and the target cytoplasmic sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) target sharing ~35% of the sequence identity of the fungal orthologues.

However, until recently the disease had been grossly neglected there due primarily to a weak economy and the primitive control measures used. The situation is now changing because of China's growing economy and the availability of the cheap and effective drug praziquantel (PZQ), which makes control programs practicable through mass preventive treatment of dogs in these endemic areas. In this study, we used a strategy to prevent parasite eggs from being released into the environment by dosing dogs monthly with baited PZQ and culling unwanted and stray dogs, as a result of which infection in humans and domestic animals can be reduced considerably. We undertook a pilot control study in two counties involving a population of 255,504 in 52,300 households and 30,380 dogs in Xinjiang, China, and showed that monthly PZQ treatment of dogs is an efficient, practicable, and affordable control method for communities to reduce considerably hyperendemic CHD.

We found that children born with SGA had the greatest risk of death at the age of 1 year, and that deaths from infection with neurologic disease were the highest risk estimates of death from infection. These findings are similar to those obtained from population-sibling-based analyses."

Many of these interactions are mediated by the binding of relatively short unstructured polypeptide segments, or peptides, in one protein to well-folded domains in other proteins. Such protein-peptide interactions have some interesting and special properties, e.g., promiscuity, which means many different peptide sequences are able to bind the same protein domain. Peptides also often exhibit structural flexibility even after binding a protein. These special properties make it desirable, but also challenging, to simulate protein-peptide binding in atomistic detail for many different peptide sequences. To this end, we have developed a computational algorithm that simultaneously explores the structure of protein-peptide complexes and the amino acid sequences of the peptide. In particular, our algorithm allows binding-competent peptide sequences to be generated in direct relation to their binding strengths. We also explored the possibility of using our method to locate new peptide-binding pockets on protein structures. Computational algorithms such as the one developed here may pave the way to reveal the full complexity of protein-protein interaction networks used in cells.","The binding of short disordered peptides to globular protein domains is important for a wide range of cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein transport, and immune response. However, the promiscuous nature of these interactions and the conformational flexibility of the peptide chain, bound, and binding specificity of the type of protein interaction challenge to understand. We develop a computational method for calculating protein-peptide binding thermodynamics sequences in a single run. This method explores peptide sequence conformational space simultaneously simulating the joint probability distribution, in particular, makes searching for peptide sequences in the sequence space computationally efficient. In this test method, we apply 3 different peptide-binding protein domains to test the ability to capture experimentally determined specificity profiles. Insight of the molecular underpinnings and observed specificities obtained from analyzing peptide conformational ensembles from a large number of binding-competent sequences.

In the early 2000s, a massive insecticide-spraying program was set up to control dwelling infestation by the blood-sucking bugs that transmit the disease. Here we provide a detailed assessment of the effects of this program in the Department of Cochabamba, one of the most highly-endemic settings worldwide. Our analyses show that municipality-level dwelling infestation rates plummeted from over 70–80% in 2001–2003 to about 2–3% in 2004–2011. This residual infestation was higher in the capital city and, more generally, in municipalities where montane dry forests dominate – probably because wild populations of the main vector, Triatoma infestans, are common in that eco-region. Despite the impressive early achievements of the program, with about 0.5 million people protected from contagion, sustained disease control will require fully operational long-term surveillance systems.","Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that is endemic in the Bolivian Department of Cochabamba. Since the early 2000s, an extensive vector control program has been implemented; 1.34 million dwelling inspections were conducted to ascertain infestation (2000–2001/2003–2011) and subsequent survey-spraying cycles targeting residual infestation foci. To assess the effects of the program on dwelling infestation rates (DIRs), we used program records to calculate annual, municipality-level aggregate DIRs (39 municipalities). The high values of 2000–2001 ( median: 0.77–0.69) and dropped ∼0.03 in 2004. A linear mixed model (municipal random factor) suggested that infestation odds decreased, on average, ∼28% (95% confidence interval [CI95], 6–44%, and 10-fold increase in control effort. The second, better-fitting mixed model including year ordinal predictor disclosed large DIR reductions in 2001–2003 ( odds ratio [ ] 0.11, CI95 0.06-0.19) and 2003–2004 (0.22, CI 95 0.14–0., and 0.34) and a moderate decrease in 2005–2006, but significant changes were not detected. Our results suggest that insecticide spraying and longitudinal surveillance may be an effective means of area-wide Chagas Disease vector control; particularly in highly-endemic settings, such as in parts of Latin America where domestic infestation triatomines are commonplace."

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides a genome-scale map of TF-binding. However, a quantitative characterization of the impact of genome accessibility on TF-binding in bacteria remains elusive. In order to help recruit or block gene expression, TFs must have physical access to regulatory regions. This paper presents a thermodynamics model that describes TF-binding in terms of genome accessibility and binding site affinity. We apply this model in a ChIP-seq dataset for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and observed that genome accessibility is critical to our understanding of TF-binding in vivo. This new model provides practical applications, such as de novo prediction of TF-binding peaks and a framework to measure DNA accessibility from ChIP-seq data. Our model enables us to quantify the relationship of genome accessibility with genomic features and suggest mechanisms that influence genome accessibility in vivo (e.g. distance to oriC). The model proposed in this study gives new perspective for ChIP-seq analysis in bacteria towards an improved description of gene regulation in silico.","ChIP-seq enables genome-scale identification of regulatory regions that govern gene expression. However, the biological insights generated by ChIP- seq analysis are limited to predictions of binding sites and cooperative interactions. Furthermore, ChIP–seq data poorly correlate with in vitro measurements of predicted motifs, highlighting binding affinity as insufficient to explain transcription factor (TF)-binding in vivo. Therefore, a comprehensive biophysical representation of TF-binding is required to improve our ability to understand, predict, and alter gene expression in bacteria. In this study, we developed a thermodynamic model that parameterizes the genome accessibility in terms of genome accessibility and binding affinity. We find that accounting for genome accessibility led to 63% of the genome’s profile variance, while a model based motif score explains 35% of variance. Our framework enables de novo Chip-seq peak prediction and can be useful for inferring TF- binding peaks under new experimental conditions reducing the need for additional experiments."

Innovations that were critical to this transition were the evolution of a weight bearing pelvis, hindlimbs and their associated musculature, and the development of the “rear wheel drive” strategy that predominates in terrestrial locomotion. The fossil record can reveal how the skeletal framework of the load-bearing limbs of tetrapods (animals descended from fish) has evolved, but as soft tissues are rarely preserved within the fossil record, it can shed little light on how the accompanying dramatic alterations of the limb musculature arose developmentally. To examine this question we determined the mechanisms that generate fin muscles within larvae of living species representing several clades of fish across the vertebrate phylogeny. Using this comparative approach and a novel somite transplantation technique in zebrafish, we determine that the pelvic fin muscles of bony fish are generated by a bimodal mechanism that has features of limb/fin muscle formation in tetrapods and primitive cartilaginous fish. Using these data, we propose a unifying evolutionary hypothesis on the origins of the muscle of the paired fins and limbs, and speculate that the adoption of tetrapod mode of hindlimb muscle formation was also an evolutionary innovation critical to the success of the tetrapod transition.","Tetrapods have evolved to utilise the sinusoidal contractions of the axial musculature, which are evident in ancestral fish species, and rely on powerful complex limb muscles to provide propulsive force. However, in tetrapods, the hindlimb-dominated locomotor strategy predominates, and evolution is considered critical for the evident success of the tetrapod transition to land. Here, we show that a stepwise modification of the primitive derived mode of pelvic fin muscle formation in bony fishes incorporates primitive derived characteristics of vertebrate appendicular muscle formation. We propose that the adoption of a fully derived form of hindlimB muscle formation and bimodal character is a state of evolutionary innovation that is critical to the successful success of this transition."

In this paper, we have combined coarse-grained and all-atom simulations of a homology model of the iPLA2. The coarse-grained description allows highly efficient simulations of the protein insertion into a lipid bilayer, while the all-atom simulations are used to refine the structures of the protein–membrane complexes. Finally, the resulting structures are validated experimentally with deuterium exchange experiments. In future works, this approach could be used to build models of other PLA2s.

Understanding the genetic mechanisms controlling arthropod susceptibility to pathogens has profound implications for developing novel strategies for controlling insect-transmitted infectious diseases. Although it was postulated that apoptosis (a genetically controlled form of cellular suicide) may play a very important role in insect innate immunity against viral infection, direct evidence has been lacking due to the lack of knowledge on the regulatory pathways responsible for the induction of apoptosis following viral infection. In this study, we found that there is a rapid induction of pro-apoptotic genes within 1–3 hours of exposure to virus. This rapid pro-apoptotic response was only observed in live animals but not in cultured cells. Genetic analysis indicated that animals lacking this rapid pro-apoptotic response were hypersensitive to viral infection. Thus our work provides unequivocal evidence indicating that rapid induction of apoptosis plays a very important role in mediating insect resistance to viral infection.","Arthropod-borne pathogens account for millions of deaths each year. Understanding the genetic mechanisms controlling vector susceptibility to pathogens has profound implications for developing novel strategies for controlling insect-transmitted infectious diseases. The fact that viruses carry genes that have anti-apoptotic activity has long led to the hypothesis that induction of apoptosis is a fundamental innate immune response. However, the cellular mechanisms mediating induction and apoptosis following viral infection remain enigmatic. In this study, we have shown that in insects that lack apoptosis, the pro-opoptotic response happens relatively late, casting doubt on the functional significance of the apoptosis in innate immunity. In vivo mosquito models of the native route of infection, we found that rapid induction of reaper-like pro-optotic genes occurs hours after exposure to DNA RNA viruses. Recapitulating a similar response in Drosophila, we also found that the rapid induction and induction of pro-OPoptosis requires the function of P53, a stress–responsive regulatory region upstream of the reaper. Importantly, our results suggest that the presence of apoptotic genes may be responsible for preventing expression of viral genes blocking infection."

While these factors are biochemically distinct, they are both synthetic lethal with loss of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes, and hence are emerging therapeutic targets. Furthermore, RAD52 and POLQ have been implicated in chromosomal break repair events that use flanking repeats to restore the chromosome. We identified distinct features of chromosomal break repair events that are mediated by RAD52 vs. POLQ. Additionally, we have found that combined disruption of RAD52 and POLQ causes at least additive hypersensitivity to cisplatin and a synthetic reduction in replication fork restart velocity. These findings indicate that POLQ and RAD52 have distinct roles in genome maintenance, such that combined disruption of these factors could be a potential therapeutic strategy.","DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are important for DNA synthesis and replication stress responses. The DNA annealing factor RAD52-family DNA polymerase POLQ causes synthetic lethality defects in BRCA1 and BRCC2, tumor suppressors important for homology-directed repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and protection of stalled replication forks. The likely mechanism is that RAD52 and POLQ are important backup pathways for DSB repair and/or replication stress response. However, the specific features of DSB and repair events require RAD52 vs. POLQ, and the combined disruption factors causes distinct effects on genome maintenance, unclear. In human U2OS cells, we generated a cell line of RAD52 mutations in the upstream polymerase domain, RAD52 knockout cell line, and combined disruption genes.

The pathogen responsible for this infection is dengue virus (DENV), which is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Unavailability of vaccines has recently sparked research endeavours aimed at vector control. To date, Wolbachia as an endosymbiotic bacterium, has shown promises as a novel biocontrol agent to restrict DENV replication in mosquitoes through a mechanism that is still elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of pelo in Wolbachia-mosquito-DENV interactions. We found that the pelo protein is upregulated upon DENV infection facilitating its replication, but Wolbachia infection leads to the suppression of the protein that may contribute to inhibition of DENV replication. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of the pelo protein in Wolbachia-mediated antiviral effect against DENV in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.","Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most important arboviruses and is transmitted by the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti.

We found that the Pelo protein upregulated DENV replication silencing leads to reduced DENV virion production, suggesting that the presence of Wolbachiae, specifically in female mosquitoes, may contribute to the reduction of DENV virus replication. In addition, the microRNA aae-miR-2940-5p, abundance highly enriched in Wolbachias-infected mosquitoes, mediate the regulation of pelo. Our data reveals the identification of a pelo host factor as positively involved in DENV infection, and that the suppression of the presence and the absence of Wolbiont contribute to virus blocking exhibited by endosymbiont."

Here we devise a model for the study of the host immune response to C. albicans infection using the nematode C. elegans. We found that infection with the yeast form of C. albicans induces rapid and robust transcriptional changes in C. elegans. Analyses of these differentially regulated genes indicate that the nematode mounts antifungal defenses that are remarkably distinct from the host responses to pathogenic bacteria and that the nematode recognizes components possessed by heat-killed C. albicans to initiate this response. Interestingly, during infection with a pathogenic fungus, the nematode downregulates antibacterial immune response genes, which may reflect an evolutionary tradeoff between bacterial and fungal defense.","Candida albicans is an opportunist that can invade the host tissues and cause life-threatening infections in susceptible individuals.

About a third of the DNA sites we found to be occupied by FoxA in the adult liver are at genes that are silent. Analysis of transcription factor binding motifs near the FoxA sites at silent genes revealed a co-occurrence of motifs for the transcriptional repressors Rfx1 and type II nuclear hormone receptors (NHR-II). Further analysis of one such region downstream of the Cdx2 gene shows that it is a cryptic enhancer, in that it functions poorly unless Rfx1 or NHR-II binding is prevented, in which case FoxA1 promotes enhancer activity. Cdx2 encodes a transcription factor that promotes intestinal differentiation; ectopic expression of Cdx2 in the esophagus can help promote metaplasia and cancer. By screening numerous staged samples of human tissues, we show that Rfx1 expression is extinguished during the progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma and thus may serve as a marker of cancer progression. These studies exemplify how the analysis of pioneer factors bound to silent genes can reveal a basis for the competence of cells to deregulate gene expression and undergo transitions to cancer.","The development of cellular reprogramming is an important step in the development of cancer. We performed a genomic location analysis of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA in an adult mouse liver. We found several FoxA bound sites near silent genes, including genes that are detectable by RNA polymerase II. Virtually all FoxA-bound silent sites are conserved sequences, suggesting a possible function. These sites enriched motifs of transcriptional repressors, including Rfx1 and type II nuclear hormone receptors. We also found a target site for a cryptic “shadow” enhancer 7 kilobases ( kb) downstream of the Cdx2 gene, which restricts transcriptional activation of FoxA. Cdx1 is ectopically induced in an early metaplastic condition in Barrett esophagus, and expression of RFX1 was not necessarily present in progressive Barrett dysplasia adenocarcinoma. In contrast, we find that expression of the gene in the esophageal epithelium gradually extinguished the progression of cancer, i.e., expression of both genes decreased markedly in Barrett and in the dysplastic conditions. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic progression of cell death."

EBV infection has latent and lytic forms. Both forms of infection contribute to the oncogenic capacity of the virus. During the lytic cycle, a cascade of temporally regulated events takes place leading to release of new virus particles. A crucial event in the lytic cascade is expression of the class of EBV late genes, which occurs after viral genome amplification. Late genes mainly encode virus structural proteins that are essential for virus transmission. For many years, the mechanisms regulating expression of late genes remained unknown. Recently, a set of proteins that control expression of late genes was discovered. These proteins form a unique viral pre-initiation complex (vPIC), which initiates synthesis of late gene mRNAs. To this day we have yet to fully understand the process by which assembly of vPIC is synchronized to result in a functional transcription machinery. In this report, we demonstrated that BGLF3, a component of vPIC, is modified by phosphorylation during the lytic phase of the viral life cycle. Phosphorylation of BGLF3 is essential for the ability of the protein to interact with two other components of vPIC, BFRF2 and BVLF1. Our results show that formation of the BGLF3, BFRF2 and BVLF1 complex is integral for synthesis of viral structural proteins. This report establishes the importance of post-translational modifications in regulating the function of vPIC in synthesis of herpesvirus structural proteins. Our findings have the potential to promote the discovery of new anti-viral drugs that inhibit assembly and release of oncogenic herpesviruses.","Epstein-Barr virus is the causative agent of herpesvirus disease and is responsible for a large number of human diseases. The virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and other animals. In this study, we identified a group of Epstein-barr virus early proteins that form a pre-translational complex (vPIC) dedicated to transcription of late genes. We found that phosphorylation of BGLF3, a core component of the vPIC module, significantly reduced the expression of the virus-independent late genes, and disrupted the production of new virus particles. Our findings provide evidence that post-translationational modifications regulate the function of the VPIC nanomachine, which initiates the synthesis of late transcripts from herpesviruses."

This study assessed the factors that influenced shoe wearing behaviors among people living in a rural community in highland Ethiopia. In this community, a substantial proportion of people are at risk for podoconiosis, a debilitating lower leg condition that can be prevented by wearing shoes. We conducted semi-structured individual interviews, focus group discussions and extended case studies among 242 adults and systematically analyzed the information. We found that shoe wearing is intermittent, and that different factors such as cost and ability to use the shoes for certain activities (such as farming) influenced consistent shoe wearing for most people. Some factors (such as shoe size, fear of stigma) were more relevant for podoconiosis patients. Social norms were found to be increasingly supportive of shoe wearing, and children exhibited greater desire to wear shoes than adults. These findings have relevance for preventing development and progression of a variety of NTDs in a range of settings.","Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a group of diseases that affect millions of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

We found that the social barriers preventing children from wearing shoes are changing, and going barefoot increasingly seen as ‘shy’ and ‘ shameful’. In addition, practical social barriers prevented children from being able to purchase pair shoes to ensure longevity and afford shoes of preferred quality. We also found that shoes were typically preserved for special occasions provided children reached certain age. These barriers are applicable to certain diseases, and underlying structural level barriers related to poverty (e.g. price, quality, unsuitability for daily activities and low risk perception) are likely to be relevant to the range of NTDs. We established conceptual models of health behavior and adoption, identified barriers to shoe wearing as amenable intervention and anticipate benefit from considering NTD prevention and shoe distribution."

The need for rabies control among striped skunks is, however, well acknowledged, and reports of occasional spill-over of skunk variant rabies viruses to non-reservoir species, including some domestic animals, remains a cause for public health concern and a major roadblock for eradicating rabies from North America. An understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of diseases is important in management and for setting future research agendas, and such knowledge could assist in effective striped skunk rabies control. In this study, we evaluated whether rabies among striped skunk cases submitted for testing in the North Central Plains exhibit discernable spatial and temporal patterns, and if there are any eco-climatic factors that influenced such patterns. Our findings indicate that the year-to-year and spatial origins of rabies incidences in the states of Kansas and Nebraska in the North Central Plains are currently stable, and certain physical environment (developed low-intensity areas and patch fragmentation) and climatic (diurnal temperature range) factors play an important role in determining such temporal and spatial patterns.","Striped skunks are important terrestrial reservoirs of rabies virus in North America, but their prevalence in the host remains largely unmanaged.

Parent-of-origin effects might contribute to the ‘missing heritability’ and involve genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance. Our study is the first that establishes (i) the magnitude and (ii) the type of parent-of-origin effects in the pathogenesis of a multiple sclerosis-like disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rat, using a strategy designed to identify genes that confer risk only when inherited from either mother or father. A striking 37-54% of all risk loci depended on parental origin. Accounting for parent-of-origin enabled more powerful and precise identification of novel risk factors for EAE, such as the imprinted Dlk1gene. Disease-predisposing alleles conferred lower Dlk1 expression in rats and transgenic Dlk1 mice demonstrated that lower Dlk1 drives more severe EAE and modulates adaptive immune responses. Because parental-origin effects are epigenetically regulated, our data implicate a contributory role for epigenetic mechanisms in complex diseases. Considering parent-of-origin effects in complex disease has enabled more powerful and precise identification of novel risk factors.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system. The etiology of MS is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the magnitude of the type of parent-to-origin effects of MS in a rat, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), using a backcross strategy. We found that 37–54% of the detected disease- predisposing loci depended on parental transmission. Additionally, the Y chromosome susceptible strain contributed to disease susceptibility. Accounting for the effects of parental-origin enabled powerful precise identification of novel risk factors and increased disease variance explained by identified factors 2-4-fold. The majority of loci displayed an imprinting–like pattern gene expressed by the maternal paternal copy exerts an effect. In particular, the locus of chromosome 6 comprises a well-known cluster of imprinted genes including paternally expressed Dlk1, an atypical Notch ligand. The disease-preferred alleles locus conferred lower DlK1 expression in rats, and data from transgenic overexpressing of the mouse model of EAE demonstrated that a reduced expression of the gene drives severe disease and modulates adaptive immune reactions in EAE. These findings suggest a significant epigenetic contribution to the etiology and etiology."

These target cells are very often rival bacteria, allowing the T6SS-wielding bacteria to outcompete other pathogens or harmless bacteria. Some bacteria deploy this weapon defensively, only firing back at aggressive cells that have attacked them. Many others use it offensively, firing their T6SS pre-emptively, irrespective of whether they have been attacked by other cells. This work aimed to discover how the activity of the T6SS is controlled in offensive bacteria compared with defensive bacteria, and how this regulation facilitates efficient killing of targeted bacteria. To do this, we studied the offensive anti-bacterial T6SS of Serratia marcescens, a pathogen causing hospital-acquired infections. We found that offensive and defensive bacteria use similar regulatory pathways to activate their T6SSs efficiently, by controlling assembly of the basic machinery and allowing time for the machine to re-position around the cell between firing events. However, the sensing proteins feeding into the regulatory pathways are different and we were able to identify a new offensive input protein. Our findings provide a better understanding of how bacteria can kill competitors, whether aggressive or peaceful neighbours, so effectively.","Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are widely used as a weapon against bacterial competitors deployed in host eukaryotic cells. The T6SS is a contractile nanomachine that delivers toxic effector proteins to directly target cells during dynamic cycles of assembly and firing. Bacterial cells adopt distinct post-translational regulatory strategies for the deployment of the type VI secretion system. ‘Defensive’ T6sss assemble fire in response to incoming attacks from aggressive neighbouring cells, and utilise the Threonine Protein Phosphorylation (TPP) regulatory pathway to achieve control. However, the TPP pathway is ‘offensive’, and firing-comers need to overcome the inhibition of the membrane complex assembly of TagF, whilst PppA-mediated phosphorylation promotes spatial reorientation and efficient killing. In contrast, the upstream input of TPP pathway defines the regulatory strategy, and a new periplasmic regulator, RtkS, has been shown to interact with the PpkA kinase S. marcescens. We propose a model in which opposing actions of the TPP signaling and TagF impose a delay in T6S-assembly firing in order to maximise the efficiency of competitor cell targeting. Our findings provide a better understanding of how bacterial cells deploy competitive weapons effectively, and implications for the structure and dynamics of varied polymicrobial communities."

Theoretically, much of our understanding of animal group motion comes from models inspired by statistical physics. In these models, animals are treated as moving (self-propelled) particles that interact with each other according to simple rules. Recently, researchers have shown greater interest in using experimental data to verify which rules are actually implemented by a particular animal species. In our study, we present a rigorous selection between alternative models inspired by the literature for a system of glass prawns. We find that the classic theoretical models do not accurately predict either the fine scale or large scale behaviour of the system. Instead, individual animals appear to be interacting even when completely separated from each other. To resolve this we introduce a new class of models wherein prawns ‘remember‚ their previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour. These show that the fine scale and large scale behaviour of the prawns is consistent with interactions only between individuals who are close together.","Inference of behaviour rules between animals and moving groups usually relies on analysis of large scale system behaviour. In recent work, we have used Bayesian methodology to compare a variety of models of collective motion of glass prawns (Paratya australiensis). We show that the model is realistic for a large scale behaviour system, but does not capture the observed locality interactions. We also show that a more sophisticated model, a spatial Markovian model, captures the local dynamics of the system. We conclude that this model can be realistic for multiple biological scales, including memory of previous interactions."

The neurophysiological mechanisms of this connection, however, remain unknown. Hippocampal place cells represent location, but it is unclear if they encode only the spatial representation of the environment or if they are also processing information about the reward valence for different locations. Here, we use population analysis to test the hypothesis that the place cells process the dual encoding of spatial representation and experience-dependent reward expectation. We show a unique population code for the experience-dependent value of the context. We present evidence that the accumulation of the place fields mediates the learning of the reward context of the environment. Our data reveal that the causal link between place field distribution and behavioral place preference is mediated by the tegmental dopaminergic activity. Optogenetic control of the ventral tegmental area demonstrates that dopaminergic signaling integrates the encoding of location and reward from hippocampal neurons. These findings shed a new light on the ability of hippocampal neurons to store the experience-dependent context reward value, enabling episodic memory for past experience to support future adaptive behavior.","The hippocampus is the main locus of episodic memory formation in the brain. The hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to encode a spatial map of the environment. However, the role of the hippocampus in learning preferential location remains unclear.

The degree of reward-driven navigation preference highly correlates with the spatial distribution of place fields recorded in the CA1 region in the hippocampus.

The mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)-dependent innate immune pathways are critical for inflammatory cytokine production. Deficiency in essential innate immune components, such as MAVS, severely impairs cytokine production and host defense that are enabled by the master transcription factor, NFκB. Here we show that murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (γHV68), a model herpesvirus for human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus, hijacks MAVS and IKKβ to abrogate NFκB activation and cytokine production. Uncoupling RelA degradation from γHV68 infection restored NFκB-dependent cytokine gene expression and elevated cytokine production. Thus, our results demonstrate that upstream innate immune activation can be harnessed by pathogens to inactivate the downstream effector and subvert cytokine production.","The mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein serves as a key adaptor to promote cytokine production. Here, we report that murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (γHV68) is a model virus oncogenic to human gamma herpesviruses, and subverts the MAVS adaptor. In early infection, γ HV68 hijacks MAVS IKKβ to induce site-specific phosphorylation of RelA, a crucial subunit of the transcriptionally active NFκB dimer, and primes RelA proteasome-mediated degradation. We show that the loss of MAVS results in elevated cytokine gene expression. Conversely, uncoupling RelA degradation from γHv68-infected mice increased cytokine levels and immune cell infiltration into the lungs of γhV68-exposed mice. Moreover, exogenous expression of a phosphorylated-deficient RelA variant restored γV68–induced cytokine output. Our findings uncover an intricate strategy in which signaling upstream of the antiviral adaptor is intercepted by the pathogen to nullify the immediate downstream effector, RelA."

Meiosis I is a unique biological event, when chromosomes pair, recombine, and segregate. The synaptonemal complex is a protein lattice that enables chromosome pairing and recombination and is unique to meiosis I. Meiosis I requires a subset of factors that are unique to germ cells and meiosis. Germ cell–specific factors are known to play crucial roles during formation of the synaptonemal complex and include synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP1, SYCP2, and SYCP3, among others. We discovered a mouse HORMA domain containing protein, Hormad1 (Nohma), which is germ cell–specific and essential for male and female fertility. Mice deficient in Hormad1 have severe defects in early recombination, synapsis, and segregation—functions attributed to yeast HORMA domain containing protein, Hop1. Moreover, Hormad1 is likely a germ cell–specific component of the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and transcriptional silencing complex.","Meiosis is a process in which homologous chromosomes pair, recombine, and form chiasmata. During meiosis, homologues connect axial elements to numerous transverse filaments that form a synaptonemal complex that is critical for chromosome pairing, segregation, and recombination.

In this study, we show that the HORMAD1 gene is essential for mammalian gametogenesis and knockout male female mice infertile. We show that mice deficient in HormAD1 exhibit meiotic arrest in the early pachytene stage, which is visualized by electron microscopy.

We find that the optimal choice of sensors depends on the public health goal, underlying network reproduction number and disease (R0). If diseases are low in R0, connected individuals provide the earliest accurate information at the onset of the peak of the outbreak. However, identifying network hubs is impractical, misleading, and misleading, because the underlying network has significant community structure, and R0 is high. Taking a theoretical approach, we derive an optimal surveillance system for early outbreak detection and find that real-world identification of sensors is nearly impossible. In contrast, our friends-and-random strategy offers a practical and robust alternative."

The many feedback loops created by these interactions can lead to oscillatory behavior. Examples of oscillations in biology include the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, the electrical activity of excitable cells, and predator-prey systems. While we understand how negative feedback loops can cause oscillations, when multiple feedback loops are present it becomes difficult to identify the dominant mechanism(s), if any. We address the problem of establishing the relative contribution of a feedback process using a biological oscillator model for which oscillations are controlled by two types of slow negative feedback. To determine which is the dominant process, we first use standard experimental methodologies: either passive observation to correlate a variable's behavior to system activity, or deletion of a component to establish whether that component is critical for the system. We find that these methods have limited applicability to the determination of the dominant process. We then develop a new quantitative measure of the contribution of each process to the oscillations. This computational method can be extended to a wide variety of oscillatory systems.","Biological systems are characterized by a high number of interacting components. Determining the role of each component is difficult, especially in the context of biological oscillations. Rhythmic behavior result from interplay between positive and negative feedback, which promotes bistability and high low activity, and slow negative feedback switches the system to high and low activity states. Biological oscillators include two types of negative feedback processes: divisive ( decreases the gain of the positive feedback loop) and subtractive (increases the input threshold) which contribute slowly to the system in high- and low-activity states. To determine the relative contribution of each negative feedback process to rhythmic activity, we use a neural network model of excitatory coupling, regulated synaptic depression ( divisive) and cellular adaptation ( subtractive feedback). We show that the subtractive process plays a major role in setting the duration of silent phase. Our computational method can be applied to a wide range of biological rhythms."

Some of the most interesting ones are G-quadruplexes (G4)—compact DNA structures in which guanines assemble into multilayered tetrads, and whose formation has been reported at the ends of linear chromosomes (telomeres) and at different regulatory regions of the genome. Although structural and basic energetic properties, as well as some biological functions of G-quadruplexes are quite well understood, not much is known about their propensity to form agregated structures. A very high density of G-quadruplexes at telomeres along with their large exposed planar surfaces indeed favor G4 aggregation through end-to-end stacking, which might be important for the protection of telomeres and DNA packaging. In this research, using computer simulations, we provide insight into moleculsr origins of stability of the higher-order G-quadruplexes and explain in structural and energetic terms a strong preference for one particular end-to-end stacking orientation. Based on the recognized aggregation driving forces, we also suggest methods for controling the aggregation preferences openining up new opportunities for designing oligomeric G-quadruplexes.","G-quadruplexes (G4) are secondary structures formed from guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences that are shown to participate in the regulation of gene expression and chromosome maintenance. G4-forming G-triplexes have a tendency to associate with cofacial stacking, an important packaging mechanism that allows the design of higher-order G4 DNA structures. To understand the molecular driving forces of G4 association, we studied the binding interaction between parallel-stranded G- quadruplexes-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We predicted that dimerization free energies and direct binding of 5’-G-tetrads are preferred for possible end-to-end stacking orientations, consistent with experimental data. Decomposition of dimers and enthalpies in combination with simulations varying ionic strength indicate that the observed orientational preferences arise from a fine balance between electrostatic repulsion of sugar-phosphate backbones and a favorable counterion binding at the dimeric interface. These molecular-scale findings suggest that G4 binding can be controlled by altering the salt concentration of G-target ligands."

One way to describe the complexity of our acoustic environment is in terms of information entropy: acoustic signals with high entropy convey large amounts of information, whereas low entropy signifies redundancy. To investigate how the brain processes this information, we controlled the amount of entropy in the signal by using pitch sequences. Participants listened to pitch sequences with varying amounts of entropy while we measured their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We show that the planum temporale (PT), a region of auditory association cortex, is sensitive to the entropy in pitch sequences. In two convergent fMRI studies, activity in PT increases as the entropy in the pitch sequence increases. The results establish PT as an important “computational hub” that requires less resource to encode redundant signals than it does to encode signals with high information content.","The entropy metric derived from information theory provides a means to quantify information transmitted by acoustic streams like speech and music. We have systematically varying the entropy of pitch sequences in brain areas of neural activity and energetic demands to increase the function of entropy. The relationship predicted to occur between the efficient encoding mechanism and the computational resource of information present in the signal: specifically, the hypothesis of the relationship between the present planum temporale (PT) and the optimal encoding mechanism. In convergent functional MRI studies, we demonstrated a relationship between PT and optimal encoding, furthermore showing that the distributed fronto-parietal network retrieval of acoustic information is independent of the entropy. Our results establish that PT is an efficient neural engine that demands a computational resource to encode redundant signals with high information content."

Yet many lines of evidence indicate that many susceptibility loci, which cannot be detected by standard statistical methods, remain to be discovered. We have developed PUMA, a framework for applying a family of penalized regression methods that simultaneously consider multiple susceptibility loci in the same statistical model. We demonstrate through simulations that our framework has increased power to detect weak associations compared to both standard GWAS analysis methods and previous applications of penalized methods. We applied PUMA to identify novel susceptibility loci for type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, where the novel disease loci we identified have been previously associated with similar diseases or are known to function in relevant biological pathways.","Punalized Multiple Regression (PMR) is a method that can identify novel disease associations in GWAS datasets. In practice, proposed PMR methods are able to identify-supported associations within GWAS but are undetectable by standard association tests. However, there are several problems with the PUMA analysis method, including computational speed, poor performance of genome-scale simulated data, and identification of associations in real data is not biologically plausible. Here, we present a new minorize-maximization (MM) algorithm and generalized linear models (GLM) combined with heuristic model selection testing methods for identification of robust associations. The PUMA framework implements the penalized maximum likelihood penalties previously proposed for GWAS analysis (i.e. Lasso, Adaptive Lasso and NEG, MCP) and the penalty previously applied to GWAS (e.g. LOG). Our simulations closely mirror real GWAS data, our framework has high performance and reliably increases the power to detect weak associations, and existing PMR method perform worse than single marker testing overall performance."

Disease transmission requires that microbes overcome the robust mosquito immune system. In the African malaria mosquito, the TEP1 protein that is homologous to mammalian complement factor C3 is shown to play a central role in mosquito immunity to malaria parasites and bacteria. In this study, we report that another mosquito protein belonging to a class of non-catalytic enzymes that are specific to arthropods is a core component of the mosquito complement-like immune pathway. We found that this new protein, named SPCLIP1, regulates the accumulation of TEP1 on malaria parasites and bacteria, and show that this can lead to distinct defense reactions including lysis and melanization of the pathogen. This work is valuable because it reveals novel insight into the regulation of mosquito complement on microbial surfaces such as those of the malaria parasites. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms regulating these defense responses may ultimately lead to the design of novel disease blocking strategies in the vector.","The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the causative agent of malaria parasites. The mosquito has evolved a complement-like protein that is required for the defense against malaria parasites and bacteria. In this study, we show that forms of TEP1 are present in the mosquito hemolymph, and that the full length of Tep1-F is proteolytically processed by a TEP-F complex including leucine-rich repeat proteins LRIM1 and APL1C. SPCLIP1 is a key regulator of the complement-Like pathway. SPLIP1 catalyzes the accumulation of the protein on microbial surfaces, and this reaction leads to lysis of the malaria parasites, which triggers an activation cascade culminating in melanization and malaria parasites in bacteria. Our findings establish the core principles of complement activation in insects and provide evidence that complement convertase-like cascade is conserved in evolution in animals."

While those problems can be solved with established methods of constraint-based modeling, no algorithm is currently available for genome-scale models to identify the pathway that has the highest possible thermodynamic driving force among all solutions with predefined stoichiometric properties. This gap is closed with our new approach OptMDFpathway which is based on the recently introduced concept of Max-min Driving Force (MDF). OptMDFpathway offers various applications, especially in the context of metabolic design of cell factories. To demonstrate the power and usefulness of OptMDFpathway, we employed it to analyze the endogenous CO2 fixation potential of Escherichia coli. While E. coli cannot assimilate CO2 into biomass, net CO2 fixation can take place along linear pathways from substrate to product and we show that thermodynamically feasible pathways with net CO2 assimilation exist for 145 (34) products when choosing glycerol (glucose) as substrate. Our results indicate that heterotrophic organisms like E. coli hold a possibly underestimated potential for CO2 assimilation which may complement existing biotechnological approaches for capturing CO2.","Metabolic networks are a critical tool for the analysis of metabolic networks. To improve accuracy, recent methodological developments have focused on integration of thermodynamic information with metabolic models to assess the feasibility of flux distributions and thermodynamic driving forces. Here, we present OptMDFpathway, a method that extends the recently proposed framework for Max-Min Driving Force (MDF) thermodynamic pathway analysis. Given a metabolic network model, OptMdfpathway identifies optimal MDF for the desired phenotypic behavior of the respective pathway and supports the optimal driving force. We present this method in a mixed-integer linear program applicable to genome-scale metabolic networks, which is applicable to the entire genome. This is an important theoretical result, as the elementary mode of the network reaches maximal MDF. We employed this method to systematically identify substrate-product combinations in Escherichia coli that are concomitant with net CO2 assimilation in thermodynamically feasible pathways. We found that biomass synthesis coupled with net carbon fixation in E. coli yields 145 949 cytosolic carbon metabolites that are contained in the genome scale model iJO1366. These promising products in terms of carbon assimilation yield thermodynamic and driving forces for orotate, aspartate and C4- metabolites and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Our results indicate that heterotrophic organisms like E., which hold possibly underestimated the potential of CO2 for assimilation, can complement existing biotechnological approaches for capturing CO2.

For gram-negative bacteria, adhesion is often mediated by pili, proteinaceous polymers that protrude from the bacterial surface and recognize host receptors. During assembly, each pilus protein subunit is assisted in folding by a chaperone that shuttles the subunit to an outer membrane usher complex, which serves as assembly platform. There, the chaperone transfers its subunit cargo into the growing pilus polymer, which protrudes out the usher pore. Here, we present the crystal structure of CfaA, the chaperone protein of the CFA/I pilus. The CFA/I pilus is the archetypal colonization factor (CF) for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, a major cause of life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea in young children of low-income countries and in travelers to these regions. This structure reveals unique features that allow us to define a new class of chaperones that assist pilus assembly in bacteria. Probing these unique features with site-direct mutagenesis, we were able to gain new insight into the mechanism of pilus assembly.","Adhesive pili are the surfaces of pathogenic bacteria that comprise polymerized pilin subunits that are essential for initiation of infections. Pili assembled by the chaperone- usher pathway (CUP) require periplasmic chaperones to assist in subunit folding, maintain stability, and escort site bioassembly. The CUP chaperons are classified into two families, FGS and FGL, based on short long length subunit-interacting loops of F1 and G1 β- strands, respectively. CfaA is responsible for the assembly of the colonization factor antigen (CFA/) and pili enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), which cause diarrhea in travelers and young children. In this study, we analyzed the crystal structure of CFAA and sequence analyses revealed unique structural and functional features, leading to propose a separate family of CfaAs closely related to CFA/E. coli. Phenotypic changes resulting from mutations in regions of the unique family provide insight into its function, consistent with regions of interactions between cognate subunits and usher proteins during pilus assembly."

Disruption of polarity is a diagnostic criterion of cancer, but exactly how deregulation of core polarity genes contribute to cancer and at which stage polarity loss promotes breast cancer development in vivo is still poorly understood. To address this directly, we deleted the core polarity gene Scrib specifically in the mouse mammary gland. Scrib loss resulted in loss of tissue architecture and duct hyperplasia in mature but not pubescent mice. Onset of hyperplasia was associated with defective spindle orientations, a failure to apoptose and was sustained by high cell turnover and Ras/Erk/Fra1 MAPK pathway activation. Scrib deficiency activated progenitors and resulted in the excess growth of atypical luminal cells and the development of ductal and alveolar hyperplasia. Overall these mice exhibited an increased incidence, onset and grade of mammary tumours. These studies provide a definitive demonstration of the critical role played by core polarity genes in maintaining mammary epithelial integrity in vivo. This mouse model is a valuable tool for understanding the role of polarity in mammary development and the most initial stages of breast cancer.","Polarity coordinates cell movement, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis to maintain a complex epithelial tissue in the mammary gland. Loss of polarity is one of the most critical events in malignant progression, but precisely how stage polarity loss impacts mammary development and tumourigenesis is unclear. We have developed a conditional mouse model of Scrib loss to study the role of Scrib in mammary duct morphogenesis, mammary progenitor cell fate maintenance, and breast cancer progression. We demonstrate that Scrib-deficiency significantly induced ductal hyperplasia characterized by high cell turnover, MAPK hyperactivity, frank polarity and mixing of apical basolateral membrane constituents and expansion of atypical luminal cells. We also show that Scrib loss activates the MAPK/Fra1 pathway and alters mammary epithelial cell spindle orientation and apoptose the final stage of duct tubulogenesis.

The vascular injury caused by the bite triggers mechanisms capable of preventing the association with hosts, such as immune response, inflammation and haemostasis. However, hematophagous insects are able to counteract these defenses through a complex repertoire of salivary molecules that have specific targets in the host. Our results show that R. neglectus salivary glands express different protein gene families, possessing multi-functional features directly related to different anti-haemostatic activities. For instance, lipocalins are proteins possessing anti-coagulant and vasodilator functions. Saliva contents have evolved to adapt to blood-feeding habit, ensuring the maintenance of blood flow, the success of the meal, and transmission of diseases.","Triatomines are hematophagous insects that act as vectors of Chagas disease.

We performed a trial where we treated macaques suffering from chronic diarrhea with human whipworms, collecting gut biopsies before and after treatment. We found that 4 out of the 5 treated macaques improved their symptoms and studied the changes in their gut immune responses, as they got better. We found that after treatment with worms, the monkeys had less bacteria attached to their intestinal wall and a reduced inflammatory response to the gut bacteria. Additionally, the composition of gut bacteria was altered in the sick macaques and was restored close to normal after treatment with whipworms. These results provide a potential mechanism by which parasitic worms may improve the symptoms of intestinal inflammation, by reducing the immune response against intestinal bacteria.","Idiopathic chronic diarrhea (ICD) is a leading cause of morbidity in rhesus monkeys kept in captivity.

In parallel, expression profiling and oligonucleotide microarrays and real-time PCR analysis revealed reductions in TH1-type inflammatory gene expression and increased expression of genes associated with IgE signaling, mast cell activation, eosinophil recruitment, alternative activation of macrophages, worm expulsion, and worm expulsion. Finally, we found that the composition of microbial communities attached to the intestinal mucosa was altered post-treatment.

We used a rigorous diagnostic approach, involving two stool samples per person and two examination techniques, namely, Koga agar plate culture and the Baermann method. We predicted the spatial distribution of S. stercoralis using Bayesian Kriging analysis. Almost half of the participants (44.7%) were infected with S. stercoralis. Of the S. stercoralis cases, 39.7% involved participants under 16 years old. S. stercoralis infection prevalence was significantly higher in males than in females. Participants younger than 10 years old had a lower risk of infection than did older participants. Furthermore, our study showed that toilet use could prevent threadworm infections by 39%. Infection prevalence in the province was negatively associated with rainfall and soil organic content and positively associated with land covered by rice fields.

Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases and Type II Diabetes are all examples of amyloid diseases. Determining the structure of amyloid fibrils is critical for understanding the mechanism of fibril formation as well as for the design of inhibitor molecules that can prevent aggregation. In the case of the Alzheimer Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, the structure of fibrils grown under conditions of mechanical agitation has been elucidated from a combination of simulation and experiments. However, the structures of the asymmetric quiescent Aβ fibrils (grown under conditions akin to physiological conditions) and of Alzheimer's brain–derived fibrils are not known. In this paper, we propose the first atomically detailed structures of these two fibrils, using molecular dynamics simulations combined with data from previously published experiments. In additions, we suggest a unifying lateral growth mechanism that explains the increased toxicity of quiescent Aβ fibrils, the effects of external perturbations on fibril lateral architecture and the inhibition mechanism of the small molecule inhibitors on fibril formation.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by amyloid deposits consisting primarily of Amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.

The structure of the asymmetric structures corresponds to the structure of two fibrillils derived from AD patients' brain- extracts. The core structure of fibrilian structures consists of a layered structure of cross-β subunits arranged tightly on β-sheet layers at an antiparallel hydrophobic-hydrophobic antiparparallel polar-polar interface. The synthetic brain-derived structures differ primarily in their chain orientation and β-strand orientation. The presence of a large continually exposed hydrophilic surface (buried symmetric agitated Aβ fibils) is likely to account for the higher toxicity of these asymmetric fibrili. Our model explains the effects of external perturbations on the fibrile lateral architecture and fibrillaryogenesis by inhibiting the action of amphiphilic molecules."

Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that control activation of the proteases caspase-1 and caspase-11 resulting in production of the inflammatory mediators IL-1β and IL-18 and death of infected cells. Mice deficient of caspase-1 or caspase-11 are more susceptible to infection with B. pseudomallei or the closely related B. thailandensis. Here we show that absence of caspase-1 completely abolished production of IL-1β and IL-18 as well as death of macrophages infected with B. thailandensis. In contrast, in the highly susceptible caspase-11-deficient mice, IL-1β and IL-18 production and macrophages death were not significantly affected. Rather, absence of caspase-11 abolished death of infected lung epithelial cells. Taken together, our results show that caspase-1 and caspase-11 have non-redundant protective roles in melioidosis: Caspase-1 primarily controls cell death of infected macrophages and production of IL-18. In contrast, caspase-11 mediates cell death of infected lung epithelial cells.","Infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei and B. thailandensis triggers the activation of NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes leading to the release of IL-1β and IL-18 in infected macrophages and pyroptosis, respectively.

In this study, we reexamine the role of the pneumonic melioidosis role caspases-1 and caspace-11 in the induction and induction of the pyrosomal infection. We found that mice deficient in caspasome-1 were significantly more susceptible to intranasal infection than wild type mice, suggesting that the cell type relies exclusively on caspasis-1 to induce the production of IFNγ. Furthermore, we found that the protective action of the intracellular IL-11 was dependent on the generation of ROS NADPH oxidase independent of the induction by the cell-type. Thus, our results identify non-du redundant protective roles of the two inflammesomes in the pathogenesis of bacterial infection."

However, there is an urgent need for novel delivery models to allow understaffed health systems to successfully deal with the increasing demand for antireviral drugs (ARVs). In this pragmatic randomized controlled trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we evaluated a novel delivery model for ARV community delivery: lay health workers (home-based carers [HBCs]) deliver ARVs to homes of patients with clinically stable ART, nurses and physicians deliver standard care to patients clinically unstable. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether the ARV Community delivery model performed equally as well as averting virological failure in standard care patients. The study took place between March 1, 2016, and October 27, 2017, and was conducted in 48 healthcare facilities in the city. We enrolled 2,172 patients enrolled in the intervention (1,163 patients) and 1,009 patients in both facilities. The intervention arm was more successful than the control arm, and 516 (44.4%) of ART patients opted to receive ARVs in their homes at the meeting point choosing the community. The outcome of the study was that 10.9% (95/872) of the intervention arm and 9.7% (91/943) intervention arm were failing virologically. This study demonstrates that the community delivery model can significantly reduce patient healthcare expenditures, and a satisfaction program high will likely save patients time. Policy-makers should consider piloting, evaluating, scaling ambitious ARVs community delivery programs to reach higher proportions of HIV patients.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02711293"

However, the molecular mechanisms that allow organisms to accurately sense nutrient availability and match their energetic demands accordingly are not well understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, we isolated mutants in C. elegans that survive about 50% longer than wild-type animals when starved. For one such mutant, we found that the extended survival was due to mutation in the unc-31 gene, which functions in the nervous system to mediate release of neuroendocrine signaling molecules including insulin. Although this gene is broadly expressed in the nervous system, we found that its activity is required in a small subset of sensory neurons to regulate starvation survival. These neurons have ciliated endings that function in detection of environmental cues. Disruption of these cilia, or inactivation of a TRPV channel localized to these cilia, mimicked the perception of nutrient deprivation leading to extended starvation survival, which is dependent on an insulin-regulated transcription factor. Disruption of this channel also extended adult lifespan. Taken together, our findings reveal that TRPV channels couple nutritional cues to neuroendocrine secretion, which in turn determines adult lifespan and larval starvation survival.","In many organisms, food is intermittently available; however, the molecular mechanisms that couple sensation and nutrient availability for growth and development are critical for survival. In this study, we isolated mutations in unc-31, a calcium-activated regulator of neural dense-core vesicle release, that conferred enhanced starvation survival. This extended survival was reminiscent of the daf-2 insulin-signaling deficient mutants, which encodes FOXO transcription factor activity and inhibited insulin signaling. We found that insulin signaling modulates metabolism, adult lifespan, dauer formation, and insulin-independent mechanisms regulate the processes that promote starvation survival, indicating that starvation survival is a distinct program. Cell-specific rescue experiments identified a small subset of primary sensory neurons that modulated starvation survival and suggest that neurons mediate perception of food availability and adult lifespan."

In the present study, we uncover that a shrimp Toll4 from a total of nine Tolls in L. vannamei confers resistance to WSSV thought inducing the NF-κB transcription factor Dorsal to inspire the production of some antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with antiviral activity. The anti-LPS-factor (ALF) and lysozyme (LYZ) family are identified as the Toll4-Dorsal pathway targeted genes with the ability to interact with viral structural proteins in response to WSSV infection.

The Toll pathway is an important pathway in the defense against bacterial infection established in shrimp, but how this pathway responds to viral infection is largely unknown. In this study, we report that Toll4-Dorsal-AMPs cascade restricts white spot syndrome viral infection in shrimp. Toll4 is a transcription factor involved in the expression of a specific set of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and lysozyme (LYZ1) family, which exert potent anti- WSSV activity. In addition, Toll4 interacts with the downstream pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and renders shrimp susceptible to infection. Furthermore, we identify Toll4 as a key player in the Toll pathway that mediates strong resistance to WSSVs by inducing specific AMPs."

Cells possess DNA helicases that facilitate movement of the replication fork through such obstacles. Here, we report the discovery that one of these DNA helicases, Rrm3, is also required for restricting DNA synthesis under replication stress. We find that the site in Rrm3 critical for this new replication function is also required for binding a subunit of the replication origin recognition complex, which raises the possibility that Rrm3 controls replication by affecting initiation. This is supported by our finding that Rrm3 associates with a subset of replication origins. Rrm3’s ability to restrict replication does not require its helicase activity or the phosphorylation site that regulates this activity. Notably, cells need error-free bypass pathways and homologous recombination to deal with DNA lesions that arise when the helicase function of Rrm3 is disrupted, but not when its replication function is disrupted. This indicates that the DNA lesions that form in the absence of the two distinct Rrm3 function are different, although both activate the DNA-damage checkpoint and are toxic to cells that lack the mediator of the replication checkpoint Mrc1.","In response to replication stress, cells activate the intra-S checkpoint, induce DNA repair pathways, increase nucleotide levels, and inhibit origin firing. Here, we report that Rrm3 associates with a subset of replication origins and controls DNA synthesis during replication stress. The N-terminal domain required for DNA synthesis maps to residues 186–212 and is critical for the binding of the Orc5 origin recognition complex. Deletion of this domain by lethal cells lacking the replication checkpoint mediator Mrc1 leads to mutations in the replication stressor hydroxyurea. Our findings suggest that the role of Rr3, an Orc5-binding domain, in restricting DNA synthesis is independent of the established role of ATPase/ helicase facilitating replication fork progression and polymerase blocking obstacles."

Some epigenetic modifications accumulate throughout life in a highly reproducible manner–they may contribute to the aging process and facilitate reliable age-predictions. So far, little is known how these “epigenetic aging signatures” are modified in cancer tissue and whether or not they are accelerated as compared to normal tissue. In this study, we systematically analyzed age-associated DNAm patterns in many types of cancer. In contrast to non-malignant tissue the epigenetic aging signatures hardly reflect chronological age of cancer patients. This may at least partially be attributed to the fact that cancer is a clonal disease capturing only the epigenetic make-up of the tumor-initiating cell. Notably, the aberrant DNAm patterns are not randomly distributed but reveal co-regulation at regions that become methylated upon aging in non-malignant tissue. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deviations of epigenetic age-predictions correlate with clinical parameters. In fact, they are clearly associated with overall survival in many types of cancer. These findings are particularly important, as they indicate relevance of age-associated DNA methylation patterns for malignant transformation, cancer development and prognosis.","Aging is associated with highly reproducible DNA methylation (DNAm) changes, which contribute to the higher prevalence of malignant diseases in the elderly. In this study, we analyzed the epigenetic aging signatures of 5,621 DNAm profiles from 25 cancer types in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Overall, age-associated DNAm patterns hardly reflect the chronological age of cancer patients, but are coherently modified in a non- stochastic manner, particularly in CpGs hypermethylated in aging non-malignant tissues. Furthermore, the observed epigenetic age-predictions correlate with overall survival types of cancer (lower grade glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, esophageal carcinoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma), cutaneous melanoma, lung and squamous cell carcinomas, and neuroendocrine neoplasms). In conclusion, the age-related DNAm pattern of cancer is not related to chronological age in the patient, but is coordinately regulated, particularly by CpG hypermethylation and normal aging. Furthermore the apparent epigenetic changes correlate with clinical parameters and overall survival of cancer, indicating that regulation of DNAm and age-linked CpPs is relevant for cancer development."

This molecule initiates the regulation of an essential protein: carbonic anhydrase, not through the known adenylyl cyclase CO2 sensor but as we discovered via a novel fungal CO2 sensing pathway involving the transcriptional regulator Rca1p. This protein is additionally implicated in growth, yeast-to-hyphae morphological switch and cell wall stability of C. albicans. The ortholog of Rca1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated a conserved function in the induction of the carbonic anhydrase in low CO2 concentration atmospheres pointing to the broad significance of Rca1p in fungal CO2 sensing.","Candida albicans is a fungal pathogen that senses changes in environmental CO2 concentration.

In other infectious and non-infectious diseases in which the immune system is affected, such as HIV-AIDS and inflammatory bowel disease, damage to gut-associated lymphocyte tissues occurs, enabling luminal bacteria to enter into the circulation. Lipopolisaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial product that stimulates macrophages, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other soluble factors such as MIF, which in turn activate lymphocytes. Continuous and exaggerated stimulation causes exhaustion of the T-cell compartment, contributing to immunosuppression.Herein, we show that an increment in LPS plasma levels also occurs in VL; the higher the LPS levels, the lower the TCD4+ and TCD8+ cell count in the blood. This T-cell depletion may affect the mucosal immune system, which, along with intestinal parasitization by amastigotes, may contribute to gut barrier damage and consequent microbial translocation. LPS levels were correlated with T-cell activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine plasma levels, MIF, and IFABP, showing that a bacterial molecule, probably from luminal origin, not associated with Leishmania infection can negatively affect the immune system. These findings points to possible benefits of antimicrobial prophylaxis in conjunction with anti-Leishmania therapy.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is characterized by parasite-specific immunosuppression and an intense pro-inflammatory response.

Little is known about the types of mutations that arise when facultative anaerobes are grown in the absence of oxygen. To investigate the effect of oxygen availability on spontaneous mutation at the genome level, we directly measured the mutation rates of bacteria that were grown with and without oxygen under controlled laboratory conditions. To our knowledge, we have obtained the most comprehensive mutation rate estimate of anaerobically grown Escherichia coli, where mutation rates are higher in the absence of oxygen. We found that genomic structural variations, a class of mutations that are typically not investigated due to technical difficulties, were more prevalent under anaerobic growth conditions. We also identified distinct DNA strand biases for substitution types under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. Our findings provide new insights into the impact that oxygen availability may have on spontaneous mutations, and the mutational processes that underlie them.","Oxidative stress is a major cause of mutation, but little is known about how the growth absence of oxygen impacts the rate spectrum of mutations.

We also found that anaerobically grown populations displayed a mutation rate nearly twice as high as aerobic populations, and showed distinct asymmetric mutational strand biases, with greater insertion and element activity. Consistent with mutation rate spectra observations, genes transposition and recombination repair are associated with SVs-regulated anaerosome growth. These results define differences in the mutational spectra affecting evolution of facultative and facultative aaerobes."

Among these applications, the search for genes with similar expression patterns (co-expression) over different samples is particularly successful. However, few network mining approaches were systematically applied to different types of cancers to extract common cancer features. We carried out a systematic study to identify frequently co-expressed gene networks in multiple cancers and compared them with the gene networks found in multiple normal tissues. We found dramatic differences between networks from the two sources, with gene networks in cancer corresponding to specific traits of cancer. Specifically, the largest gene network in cancer contains many genes with cell cycle control and DNA stability functions. We thus predicted that a set of poorly studied genes in this network share similar functions and validated that most of these genes are involved in DNA break repair or proper cell division. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest scale of such a study.","Gene co-expression network analysis is an effective method for predicting gene functions and disease biomarkers.

In contrast, 6 networks were found in normal tissues, highly enriched for genome stability and maintenance functions. We tested 13 selected genes network involvement in genome maintenance and cell-based assays and 10 were shown to be involved in homology-directed DNA repair and centrosome duplication control including the well-known cancer marker MKI67.

In this work, we used a different strategy, deriving a binding model that describes the protein-protein interactions of basic-region leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcriptions factors directly from a large body of experimental interaction data. Our model showed much better performance than previously published predictors. We used our model, in conjunction with a protein-design strategy that builds new proteins from modular parts of known proteins, to successfully design novel bZIP-like protein domains. We demonstrated experimentally that the designed proteins bind tightly and specifically to a number of human bZIPs that regulate important processes including stress responses and oncogenesis.","Selective dimerization of basic-region leucine- zipper (bZIP) transcription factors presents a vivid example of the high degree of interaction specificity achieved by a family of structurally similar proteins. The coiled-coil motif mediates homo- and hetero-dimerization of bZIP proteins and has been intensively studied, and a variety of methods have been proposed to predict interactions with sequence data. In this work, we develop a predictive model that exploits the knowledge of the structurally conserved residue-and residue interactions of the coiled coil motif. The model, which expresses the interaction energies in sum of interpretable residue-pair triplet terms, achieves correlation between experimental binding free energies and R = 0.68 significantly-performs scoring functions. We use the model to develop novel synthetic peptides for assembling and assembling 7- residue native-protein heptad modules into new combinations. We find that the optimal combination of heptads can bind selectively to human bZip domains, and target paralogs. Our approach, which is based on a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, confirmed the formation of tight selective heterodimers for the designed peptides."

Here, we conducted a foraging experiment in which rats chose among four different foods over a continuous two-week time period. With respect to when, we found bursts of rapidly occurring responses separated by long inactive periods. With respect to what, we found biased choice behavior toward the favorite items as well as repetitive behavior, reflecting goal-directed and habitual responding, respectively. We account for the when and what components with two distinct computational mechanisms, each composed of two processes: (a) active and inactive states for the temporal dynamics, and (b) goal-directed and habitual control for the sequential dynamics. This study provides behavioral and computational insights into the dynamical properties of decision-making that determine both when an animal will act and what the animal will choose. Our findings provide an integrated framework for describing the temporal and sequential structure of everyday choices among, for example, food, music, books, brands, web-browsing and social interaction.","A fundamental understanding of behavior requires predicting how an individual will choose. However, the actual temporal sequential dynamics of successive choices of multiple alternatives remain unclear. In this current study, we tested the hypothesis of a general bursting property of timing and sequential patterns of foraging decisions. We conducted a foraging experiment in rats that chose different foods over a continuous three-week time period. We found bursts of rapidly occurring actions, separated by time- varying inactive periods, partially based on the circadian rhythm. When chosen, we found that sequential dynamics were characterized by key features: (a) highly biased choice distribution; (b) preferential attachment, animals were more likely to choose previously chosen than animals that were previously chosen. To capture temporal dynamics, we propose a dual-state model consisting of active inactive states and bursty activity, and a non-homogeneous Poisson process with longer inactivity bursts. We propose that the bursty nature of behavior emerges from the interaction between different underlying systems, leading to heavy tails of the distribution of behavior during time choices."

We compared the evolution of homologous bacterial enzymes (ribonucleases H1) from two lineages: one from Escherichia coli, which live at moderate temperatures, the other from Thermus thermophilus, which live at extremely high temperatures. Our aim was to investigate how these structurally homologous proteins can have such different thermostabilities, unfolding at temperatures that are 20°C apart. We used bioinformatics to reconstruct the sequences of ancestral proteins along each lineage, synthesized the proteins in the lab, and experimentally traced the evolution of ribonuclease H1 stability. While thermostability appears to have been strongly shaped by selection, the biophysical mechanisms used to tune protein stability appear to have varied throughout evolutionary history; this suggests that proteins have wide latitude to explore different mechanisms of stabilization, generating biophysical diversity and opening up new evolutionary pathways.","Bacterial ribonuclease H1 (RNH) proteins are thermophiles that are generally thermostable and mesophilic homologs, but little is known about the evolutionary process driving these differences. Here, we show that RNH proteins from Thermus thermophilus (ttRNH), Escherichia coli (eCNH) share similar structures but differ in melting temperature (Tm) at 20°C. Tm is a thermodynamic parameter that correlates with growth temperatures, consistent with environmental selection and stability. Finally, we synthesized experimentally characterized intermediates of the two lineages leading to the same ancestor. We found that the thermodynamic basis of stability was strongly driven by selection, and that the overall stability of the RNH system was strongly influenced by the phenomenon of “thermodynamic system drift.” This suggests that lineages of strong selection increase stability, and proteins wide latitude explore sequence space, generating biophysical diversity and potentially opening new evolutionary pathways."

The initial innate immune responses to such viruses have to restrict virus spread before the adaptive immune responses fully develop. Therefore, it is of fundamental practical importance to understand the robustness and fragility of the early protection against such virus infections mediated by the type I interferon (IFN) response. Because of the inherent complexity of the virus-host system, we have used mathematical modeling to predict the sensitivity of the kinetics and severity of infection to variations in virus and host parameters. Our results suggest that the spleen represents a robust sink system for systemic virus infection and that this system is able to cope with substantial variations in IFN secretion and virus production. However, the system is very fragile to only minor increases in the virus growth rate in peripheral tissues. Collectively, the mathematical approach described in this study allows us to identify the most robust virus and host parameters during early cytopathic virus infection and can serve as a paradigm for systems immunology analyses of multiscale virus-host interaction of many life-threatening cytopathic virus infections.","Plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-mediated protection against cytopathic virus infection involves molecular, cellular, and tissue-scale, organism-scale events. In order to better understand these multiscale interactions, we implemented a systems immunology approach focusing on the structure, dynamics, and operating principles of virus-host interactions to constrain the initial spread of the pathogen. Using high-resolution experimental data sets from the coming-described mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model, we calibrated basic modules including MHV infection primary target cells, i.e. pDCs and macrophages (Mφs), to generate an integrative mathematical model of the in vivo infection dynamics. Parameter estimation system indicated that on a per capita basis, infected pDC secretes sufficient type of IFN to protect 103 104 Mφ’s from cytopathsic viral infection. Furthermore, the extremely high protective capacity of infected pdcs secures the spleen capability to function as a ‘ sink’ for virus produced in the peripheral organs of the liver. These results suggest that the pDC population in the liver ensures robust protection against virus variants exhibiting enhanced liver tropism and higher replication rates."

Large changes to the local environment, e.g. moving the animal to a different room, can induce a complete reorganization of place-cell firing locations. Such ‘global remapping’ reveals that memory for different environments is encoded as separate spatial maps. Smaller changes to features within an environment can induce a modulation of place cell firing rates without affecting their firing locations. This kind of ‘rate remapping’ is still poorly understood. In this paper we describe a computational model in which discrete memories for contextual features were stored locally within a spatial map of place cells. This network structure supports retrieval of both positional and contextual information from an arbitrary cue, as required by an episodic memory structure. The activity of the network qualitatively matches empirical data from rate remapping experiments, both on the population level and the level of single place cells. The results support the idea that CA3 rate remapping reflects content-addressable memories stored as multimodal attractor states in the hippocampus.","Episodic-like memory is thought to be supported by attractor dynamics in the hippocampus. However, the spatial map of place cells encodes contextual information and firing rate variability. To test whether memories stored in multimodal attractors populations in place cells, recent experiments morphed into a familiar context by observing responses in CA3 cell ensembles. The average population activity of CA3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions between different points in the morph sequence, which displayed a hysteresis signature of attractors dynamics. To understand seemingly conflicting results and commensurate attractor network theory, we developed a neural network model to model CA3 attractors position-dependent in discrete contexts. We found that when memories were stored in overlapping neural networks, the positions-dependent context of the attractors transitions at different points of morph sequence. Smooth transition curves arose averaging the population, and heterogeneous set of responses were observed at single unit level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt coherent transitions at population single unit levels. Strong recurrent feedback entailed a hysteretic effect that diminished the overlap of stored memories. These results suggest that context-dependent memory is supported by overlapping local attractors in the temporal map of CA1 place cells. Similar mechanisms are found in regions of the cerebral cortex."

The pathogenesis of local effects induced by Bothrops asper venom has been studied by traditional methodologies. Recently, proteomic analysis of wound exudates collected in the vicinity of affected tissue has become a powerful tool to study the pathogenesis of local envenoming from a more integrative perspective. Thus, in the present study we analyzed the dynamics of the local effects induced by B. asper venom in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice through a proteomic and immunochemistry approach in order to identify biomarkers of tissue damage and repair during the course of envenoming. Our results showed an early presence of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in exudates as compared to cytoskeletal proteins, which reflect the rapid cytotoxic effect of venom, followed by the action of endogenous proteinases in the cytoskeleton of damaged muscle fibers later on in the course of envenoming. On the other hand, the early presence of extracellular matrix components and the increment of some of them in exudates, reflect the rapid microvascular damage and hemorrhage induced by the venom, followed by the action of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) during tissue remodeling as part of the inflammatory response. Overall our study allowed the identification of key biomarkers of tissue damage and repair as part of the pathological effects induced by B. asper venom in skeletal muscle, which offer relevant insights for a better understanding of the complex dynamics of local pathology induced by viperid snakebite envenoming.","The time-course pathological effects of venom of snake Bothrops asper in muscle tissue are investigated using a combination of histology, proteomic analysis of exudates collected in the vicinity of damaged muscle, and immunodetection of extracellular matrix proteins. Proteomic assays are an excellent new methodological tool to detect key biomarkers of tissue alterations from an integrative perspective of snake venom-induced pathology. In this study, we show that the early presence of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in exudate reflects a rapid cytotoxic effect of venom, especially on muscle fibers, followed by action of proteinases in the cytoskeleton and damaged muscle fibers. Similarly, the presence of basement membrane (BM) and extracelellular matrix (ECM) proteins in intracellular proteins reflects rapid microvascular damage and hemorrhage induced by snake venom metalloproteinases. The presence of fragments of type IV collagen perlecan hour envenoming suggests that hydrolysis of mechanically/structurally-relevant BM components plays a key role in the genesis of hemorrhage. On the other hand, the increment of ECM proteins exudated at later time intervals is likely consequence of the action of endogenous matrix metallopeases (MMPs) in the de novo synthesis and the tissue remodeling of the inflammatory reaction.

We find that reported confidence does not appear to reflect the probability that a decision is correct, but instead emerges from a heuristic approximation of this probability.","Humans use a variety of cognitive tasks to assess their ability to make decisions. However, it is widely believed that these reports reflect a Bayesian probability of a decision to be correct, a hypothesis that has not been rigorously tested in non-Bayesian alternatives. Here, we show that the perceptual categorization tasks that use Bayesian confidence reporting require subjects to account for sensory uncertainty in a specific way. We find that subjects with sensory uncertainty account for reporting confidence, suggesting that the brain areas involved in reporting confidence access to low-level representations of sensory uncertainty, a prerequisite for Bayesian inference. Our results suggest that the behavior is fully consistent with the Bayesian hypothesis better described by simple heuristic models that use uncertainty in the non- Bayesian way."

Evolutionarily, recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations, thus explaining the pervasiveness of recombination and sex. Recombination is also a central parameter in population genetic studies designed to detect the presence of selection acting across genomes. Current evolutionary analyses are hindered, however, by the use of imprecise recombination rates that can influence the results and skew their interpretation. This limitation is associated with the lack of detailed characterization of natural variation in recombination across genomes and within species. Our study in Drosophila melanogaster represents the first integrated, whole-genome description of recombination that alleviates these deficiencies in any organism. Our results and conclusions will help to characterize the molecular basis of the observed variation in recombination across genomes and have an immediate impact on population genetic analyses of selection, laying the foundation for a new generation of population models that will better capture natural variation in recombination and its consequences.","Recombination is a fundamental biological process that has profound evolutionary implications. The theory predicts that recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations. However, direct tests of this prediction are restricted to qualitative trends and lack detailed characterization of recombination rate variation in genomes of species. In this report, we use a high-resolution description of genomic population variation and recombination rates to assess the presence of mode of selection within species. We use a new generation of population genetic models to estimate recombination. We show that high levels of variation in recombination in individuals exhibit extreme highly punctuated variation in chromosomes, hot coldspots, and hotspots in the low frequency sample. GC rates are uniformly distributed across genome CO rates, but detectable regions are reduced in regions absent of CO. At the local scale, recombination events associated with numerous sequence motifs tend to occur in transcript regions, suggesting chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. These non-independent layers of variation within recombination genomes in individuals need to be taken into account in order to obtain relevant estimates of recombinations rates."

The human parasite P. falciparum transports proteins encoded by multigene families onto the surface of erythrocytes, mediating interactions between infected red blood cells (iRBCs) and other host-cells and are thought to play a key role in parasite survival during blood-stage development. The function of other exported Plasmodium protein families remains largely unknown. We provide novel insights into expression and cellular location of proteins encoded by three large multigene families of rodent malaria parasites (Fam-a, Fam-b and PIR). Multiple members of the same family are expressed in a single iRBC, unlike P. falciparum PfEMP1 proteins where individual iRBCs express only a single member. Most proteins we examined are located in the RBC cytoplasm and are not transported onto the iRBC surface membrane, indicating that these proteins are unlikely to mediate interactions between iRBCs and host-cells. Unexpectedly, liver stages also express many of these proteins, where they locate to the vacuole surrounding the parasite inside the hepatocyte. In support of a role of these proteins for parasite growth within their host cells we provide evidence that Fam-A proteins have a role in uptake and transport of (host) phosphatidylcholine for parasite-membrane synthesis.","Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria in humans and rodents. The parasite is transmitted to humans through the blood of infected red blood cells (RBC). The RBC is the host cell of the parasite, which is responsible for the development of liver and erythrocytes. In this study, we have analysed the expression of the Plasmodia multigene families exported from the RBC. We show that the family members are expressed in the liver stage, and are transported to the hepatocyte via a parasitophorous vacuole. Furthermore, we show that these family members have a history of functional differentiation and are unique to the RMP. We demonstrate that these families are mutually exclusive and that the tagged proteins are transported from the iRBC cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, indicating that they are unlikely to play a direct role in the cellular and host cell interactions. Unexpectedly, family members expressed in liver stages, and were transported via the parasite to the liver. Our results suggest that these protein families may promote parasite development in liver and blood, supporting parasite development of hepatocytes and the host immune response. These observations indicate that these proteins may transfer phosphatidylcholine in vitro."

Depending on the strain and route of infection the disease may be fatal in humans. In order to better understand F. tularensis as an etiological agent as well as its potential as a biological weapon, we have completed draft sequence assemblies of five globally diverse strains. We have performed a comparative analysis of these sequences with other available public Francisella sequences of strains of differing virulence.

Higher viral load set-points increase infectivity and decrease survival. Previous work has shown that the most commonly observed viral load set-points are those intermediate viral load set-points which lead to the largest number of opportunities to transmit HIV-1 in an infectious person's lifetime, balancing survival and infectiousness. This coincidence between the most common viral load set-points and the optimum for lifetime transmission could be the result of population-level selection acting on HIV-1. However, this could only have happened if viral load set-point is a heritable characteristic of the virus, i.e. if viral load set-points are similar between both partners of transmitting couples. By studying viral load set-points amongst heterosexual couples, we show that viral load set-points are similar in these couples. When we study only those couples with strong genetic support for transmission, their viral loads are even more similar than when we study the whole group. These results suggest that there are viral factors which are passed from one infected individual to the next which play a role in determining viral load set-point and that population-level selection could act upon these viral factors.","The HIV-1 viral load set-point is a surrogate measure of viral virulence, which is subject to natural selection by the human host population. The key test hypothesis is that viral load sets-points are correlated with transmitting individuals acquiring infection. We retrospectively identified 112 heterosexual HIV- discordant couples enrolled in a cohort in Rakai, Uganda, and found that HIV transmission was suspected to occur in 57 couples. We also used sequence data available to establish transmission genetic linkage between 57 couples with strong genetic support for transmission. We estimated the proportion of variance between viral load and set-points explained by similarity between couples (‘couples effect’). Individuals suspected intra-pair transmission (97 couples) were similar to those suspected to transmit HIV. We found that the couple effect explained 16% of the variance in viral loads (23% adjusted). Our findings shed light on the role of viral factors in the pathogenesis and evolution of the virus."

Impairments Wnt signalling Paneth cell biology represent pathophysiological hallmarks small intestinal inflammation considered interesting targets new therapeutic approaches .","Crohn's Disease (CD) is to date incurable and is characterized by severe, reoccurring inflammations that can affect different intestinal locations. The complicated and multifactorial pathogenesis is not completely understood but involves disturbed epithelial barriers and immune reactions against the commensal flora in genetically predisposed individuals. Some inherited disease mechanisms are specific for small intestinal CD and are often connected to impaired Paneth cells. These specialized cells are critical for epithelial defences in the small intestine, and their most abundant antimicrobials (HD-5 and HD-6) are primarily diminished in patients who suffer from CD at this location. In this context, we previously identified a primary role of the Wnt pathway factor TCF7L2, which regulates the expression of both these antimicrobial peptides. We have now studied a functional mutation in the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 that was more frequent in early onset ileal CD. It was also associated with severe penetrating behaviour and linked to especially low HD-5 expression in ileal CD patient biopsies. Independently, we found that a reduced epithelial expression likely represents an additional impairment of the Wnt co-receptor in the disorder. LRP6 is a new player in small intestinal CD and underlines the importance of Paneth cell antimicrobial defences in the disease pathogenesis.","Ileal Crohn Disease (CD) is a chronic small intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by reduced levels of antimicrobial peptides DEFA5 (HD-5) and DEFA6 ( HD-6) in Paneth cells (PCs).

Here, we investigated the role of the Wnt factor, a co-receptor of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), in the development of CD. We found that LRP6 was associated with early onset of CD, colonic CD and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, we identified a non-synonymous SNP (SNP2302685; Ile1062Val) in early onset and late onset of the disease. This SNP is associated with low levels of HD-5/6 gene expression in PCs, suggesting that it may be a potential target for new therapeutic approaches."

Many documented cases suggest that symptom recovery is accompanied with antiviral RNA silencing. Most plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that can facilitate transient viral entry into meristems by blocking host RNA silencing defenses. However, the mechanisms of the following longer-term viral exclusion and modulation of VSRs functions remain elusive. Our studies with a substitution mutation in the CP gene demonstrate that the CMV CP has a negative role in SAM invasion. The studies suggest that during late infections, increasing CP concentrations induce potent RDR6/SGS3-dependent antiviral silencing by down-regulating accumulation of the 2b protein and induction of efficient siRNA amplification. Here, we propose a new evolutionary strategy in which the CMV CP has a role mediating viral self-attenuation and long-term symptom recovery.","The ability of plant viruses to suppress RNA silencing (VSRs) has been shown to facilitate the transient viral invasion of SAM. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that a wild-type Cucumber mosaic virus (CMVWT) invaded SAM transiently, subsequently eliminated meristems. Unexpectedly, CMVRA harbors an alanine substitution of the N-terminal arginine-rich region coat protein (CP) and persistently invaded SAM, resulting in visible reductions of apical dominance. Notably, CMVWT virus elicited potent antiviral silencing by infecting Arabidopsis mutants lacking host RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) and SUPPRESSOR GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3). Our findings suggest that the CMV CP acts as a central hub for antiviral RNA-silencing and that it may be a mechanism that mediates viral self-attenuation and long-term symptom recovery."

In most cases, mutations occurred in a drug target can attenuate the binding affinity of the drugs. Here, we studied the drug resistance mechanisms of the mutations G2032R in the ROS1 tyrosine kinase in fusion-type NSCLC. It is well known that the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) plays a vital role in the binding of competitive inhibitors in tyrosine kinases, and numerous mutations have been found occurred around the P-loop, which may affect the binding/unbinding process of a drug. Free energy surfaces were constructed to characterize the impact of the mutation to the binding/unbinding process of a well-known NSCLC drug, crizotinib. Two advanced free energy calculation methods, namely funnel based well-tempered metadynamics and umbrella sampling based absolute binding free energy calculation achieved consistent results with the experimental data, suggesting that the rigid P-loop of the mutated target was mainly responsible for the crizotinib resistance to ROS1 tyrosine kinase.","Tyrosine kinases are important targets of chemical drug therapy in carcinomas. However, due to their strong purifying selection, drug resistance usually occurs in cancer cells in the short term. In some cases, drug drug resistance is found associated with secondary mutations in the drug target, which can lead to attenuated drug-target interactions. For example, recently, a secondary mutation, G2032R, was detected in a cancer cell. The drug target of this mutation, ROS1, was a crizotinib-resistant patient, and the drug binding affinity was shortened by the shortened residence time induced by the flattened free energy surface. In addition, the binding affinity of the drug was emphasized by rational drug design to overcome kinase resistance."

Recently, it was discovered that bacteria also form organelles–bacterial microcompartments (BMCs)–composed of a protein shell that surrounds functionally related enzymes. BMCs long evaded detection because they typically form only in the presence of the substrate they metabolize, and they can only be visualized by electron microscopy. A few BMCs have been experimentally characterized; they have diverse functions in CO2 fixation, pathogenesis, and niche colonization. While the encapsulated enzymes differ among functionally distinct BMCs, the shell architecture is conserved. This enables their detection computationally, as genes for shell proteins are typically nearby genes for the encapsulated enzymes. We developed a novel algorithm to comprehensively identify and categorize BMCs in sequenced bacterial genomes. We show that BMCs are often encoded adjacent to genes that play supporting roles to the organelle's function. Our results provide the first glimpse of the extent of BMC metabolic diversity and will inform design of genetic modules encoding BMCs for introduction of new metabolic functions in a plug-and-play approach.","Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are proteinaceous organelles involved in autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism. BMCs share homologous shell proteins that differ in complement enzymes; typically encoded adjacent to shell protein genes are genetic loci, operons, and operons. To enable the identification of functional (sub)types of BMCs, we developed LoClass, an algorithm that finds putative BMC loci inventories, weights, and compares constituent pfam domains to construct locus similarity networks to predict locus (sub)-types. In addition, LoClass was able to analyze sequences from seven candidate bacterial phyla (single-cell genomic studies) in the LoClass taxonomy.

Different PTM sites within a protein usually co-operate to fulfill their functional roles. Recent advances in high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) technologies have facilitated the proteome-wide identification of PTM sites, giving rise to both challenge and opportunity to understand their functional relationships. Previously, several data mining approaches have been developed to explore the global PTM interplays. In this study, we proposed to infer functional associations between PTM sites from the correlation of their modification status across many biological conditions, which was not exploited before. In practice, we tested if a pair of sites are modified together under the same condition significantly more often than expected (co-occurrence). As a proof of principle, we applied this analytical strategy to human phosphorylation because we could collect data sets of proteome-wide coverage under 88 different conditions. We demonstrated that sites with co-occurring phosphorylation status are functionally associated from several lines of evidence. The co-occurrence analysis can also uncover functionally connected phosphosites with clear biological evidence which are missed by other approaches. With increasing proteome-wide data for other types of PTMs under different conditions, the co-occurrence analysis can be integrated with other methods to identify novel PTM associations.","Post-translational modifications (PTMs) add a layer of complexity to the proteome and regulate a wide range of cellular protein functions. However, there is an increasing number of known PTM sites, and it is imperative to understand functional interplays.

We applied proteome-wide human phosphorylation data collected from 88 different laboratory physiological conditions. We found that co-accurrence occurs significantly more frequently than randomly expected and include known examples of cross-talk and functional connections. In addition, we found that phosphoprotein interacting partners, likely sequence and structural proximity, phosphorylated kinases, participate in similar biological processes, including residue co-evolution in vertebrates. In contrast, we also found that the co-occurring states tend to be conserved in orthologous phosphosites of the mouse proteome. These results support the hypothesis that the propensity to modified is likely to be functionally associated with PTM."

A series of experimental and computational studies of gene expression in various murine tissues has led us to a different conclusion. By applying a new analysis strategy and a number of alternative algorithms, we identify baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all genes. While the phase and amplitude of oscillation vary between different tissues, circadian oscillation remains a fundamental property of every gene. Reanalysis of previously published data also reveals a greater number of oscillating genes than was previously reported. This suggests that circadian oscillation is a universal property of all mammalian genes, although phase and amplitude of oscillation are tissue-specific and remain associated with a gene's function. We hypothesize that the cell's metabolic respiratory cycle drives the oscillatory pattern of gene expression. These findings imply that biological pathways should be considered as dynamic systems of genes oscillating in coordination with each other.","In mammals, the circadian periodicity is described by gene expression in the hypothalamus and multiple peripheral tissues. It is accepted that 10%–15% of genes oscillate in a daily rhythm, regulated by the intrinsic molecular clock. However, statistical analyses of periodicity are limited to small size datasets with high levels of stochastic noise. We propose a new approach applying digital signal processing algorithms to separately group genes oscillating in a phase. Combined with statistical tests for periodicity, our method identifies circadian baseline oscillation in 100% of the expressed genes. Consequently, circadian oscillation gene expression is evaluated in the study of related biological pathways. Changes in gene expression caused by mutations in the regulation of environmental factors (photic stimuli or feeding) are considered in the context of changes in amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations."

In Escherichia coli, DnaA binds ATP and ADP with similar affinity but only the ATP bound form is active. An increased level of DnaAATP causes overinitiation and cell death by accumulation of DNA strand breaks. These strand breaks often result from forks encountering gapped DNA formed during repair of oxidative damage. We provide evidence that cell death in overinitiating cells can be prevented by rewiring the metabolism to favor the micro-aerobic respiratory chain with the cytochrome bd-1 as terminal oxidase. Cytochrome bd-1 is found in aerobic as well as anaerobic bacteria. Its role is to reduce O2 in micro-aerobic conditions and work as an electron sink to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species. Our results suggest that bacteria can cope with replication stress by increasing respiration through cytochrome bd-1 to reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species, and hence oxidative damage to a level that does not interfere with replication fork progression.","Chromosome replication in Escherichia coli is initiated by the DnaA-O oriC nucleoprotein complex, which promotes strand opening, helicase loading and replisome assembly. Following initiation, DNAAATP is converted into DnaADP primarily by the Regulatory Inactivation of DnaAs process (RIDA). In RIDA deficient cells, RIDA accumulates leading to uncontrolled initiation of replication and cell death and accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Mutations that suppress RIDA deficiency dampen the overinitiation and permit growth despite overiniation. We characterize mutations in a group of common metabolic routes that are rewired resulting in redirection of electron flow to cytochrome bd-1. We propose that this redirection lowers the formation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage in DNA in general. This increase in processivity and replication forks generated at the level that sustains the viability of the cell."

Until recently the constraints of working at biosafety level 4 had hindered the large scale study of host factors associated with henipavirus infection. MicroRNAs are a class of single-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate biological processes in eukaryotes. An emerging body of evidence suggests that host microRNAs may favour infection of vertebrate RNA viruses. We have performed high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection and appear to suppress multiple antiviral host molecules. Infection promotion is primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to repress Eph receptors that negatively regulate henipavirus glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion. This study is the first large-scale screen of host-encoded microRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus, and of a BSL-4 virus, and supports the emerging notion that host miRNAs can play a role in supporting infection of RNA viruses.","Hendra Nipah viruses (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus) are bat-borne viruses that cause fatal disease in humans and a range of mammalian species. Gaining deeper understanding of the host pathways exploited by henipaviruses infection will identify targets for new anti-viral therapies. We performed a genome-wide high-throughput agonist antagonist screen at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) that are important for infection and infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 family strongly promoted Hendra virus infection, but did not affect infection with paramyxoviruses and other genera, indicating the specificity of virus-host interaction. Infection promotion was primarily mediated by the ability of miRs-181 to significantly enhance henipovirus-induced membrane fusion. Cell signalling receptors for ephrins, EphA5 and EphB4, were identified as novel negative regulators of henipvirus fusion, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of Ephs and miRNA contributes to enhanced infection and fusion. Immune-responsive miRNA levels were also regulated in biofluids of ferrets and horses infected with Hendra viruses, suggesting a host innate immune response that may promote henipivirus spread and exacerbate disease severity. Our study provides the first comprehensive screen of miRNAs influencing infection in a clinically significant mononegavirus."

Outbreaks without clear diagnosis are concerning, particularly in countries such as Sudan where a range of high consequence diseases, including viral haemorrhagic fevers, are endemic or epidemic, and local laboratory capacity is limited. We transferred historical samples stored in the National Public Health Authority from one of these outbreaks that occurred in Darfur 2015–2016 to the Public Health England Laboratory at Porton, UK, and tested them against a wide range of infectious diseases to try to identify the cause, and to help the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health to develop and target their limited laboratory capacity. We found that Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever was an important cause but not the only source of cases in this outbreak. This has implications for prevention and control as well as for treating cases.

Periodic outbreaks in Kenya are associated with greater than average rainfall, although outbreaks have not previously been reported in western Kenya. The virus is spread between animals and to people by mosquitos. Contact with infected animal tissues and products are also risk factors for transmission of RVFV to people. This study investigated the seroprevalence of RVFV in 1861 residents of western Kenya and compared this to the seroprevalence in 553 ruminant slaughterhouse workers. The seroprevalence of RVFV in people in western Kenya was less than 1%, which is consistent with previous reports from the region. Slaughterhouse workers were shown to be a higher risk group for RVFV seropositivity, with seroprevalence of 2.5%. The identification of plausible risk factors including slaughtering is consistent with reports from other regions. The results suggest that it is plausible that RVFV virus is circulating in western Kenya. Improved surveillance in low risk areas is recommended particularly during countrywide outbreaks.","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting livestock and people.

The study was conducted in western Kenya between July 2010 and November 2012. Individuals were recruited from randomly selected homesteads and census slaughterhouses. Structured questionnaire tools were used to collect information on demographic data, health, risk factors, and zoonosis disease exposure. Indirect ELISA serum samples were determined to determine seropositivity of RVFsV in the community. Risk factor analysis was conducted with multi-level logistic regression. A total of 1861 individuals were sampled from 384 homesteaders.

These data demonstrate that slaughtering animals is a risk factor for RVFFV seroposiveness in slaughterhouses and that slaughterhouses are considered to have a high risk group. These risk factors were previously reported in other studies providing evidence for the presence of the virus in the environment."

In most countries, vector control is implemented by the use of insecticides to reduce mosquito populations. During epidemics, insecticides of the pyrethroid family (blocking the voltage gated sodium channel protein in the nerve sheath) are used by space spraying with vehicle mounted thermal foggers to kill adult mosquitoes. Unfortunately some populations of Ae. aegypti have become resistant to these insecticides, leading to operational challenges for public health services. In Martinique (French West Indies), resistance to pyrethroids was detected in the 1990s. The present study assessed the impact of this resistance on the efficacy of vector control operations in 9 localities of Martinique. Here we showed that the resistance strongly reduces the efficacy of pyrethroid-based treatments, thus emphasizing the urgent need for alternative insecticides or tools to reduce dengue transmission.","Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that is transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti.

In order to assess the impact of pyrethroids on vector control and efficacy of treatments, applications of deltamethrin and natural pyrethrins were performed in 9 localities of Martinique. In the presence of pyrthroids, the mortality rates of naturally resistant laboratory susceptible mosquitoes were assessed. In addition, larval adult densities were estimated. Results showed high mortality rates and that susceptible sentinel mosquitoes treated with deltamsethrin resistant mosquitoes exhibited low mortality rates. The reduction in larval and adult Ae.

In humans, monocytes are recruited to the site of infection and differentiate into MΦ upon the onset of microbial infection. The MΦ phenotype and function are determined by the cytokine profile of the microenvironment in which the monocyte enters. Additionally, vitamin D is known to trigger direct antimicrobial responses against invading pathogens in MΦ, but also disrupts the differentiation of immune subsets within the myeloid lineage. Therefore, we investigated whether vitamin D status during MΦ differentiation influenced either phenotype or function. Here, we found that the IL-15 MΦphenotype is sustained regardless of vitamin D status. In contrast, antimicrobial MΦ differentiated in the presence of vitamin D exhibited a robust expression of an antimicrobial peptide, relative to MΦ differentiated in the absence of vitamin D. The antimicrobial MΦ armed with cathelicidin prior to M. leprae challenge demonstrated a strong antimicrobial response against the invading pathogen. Our study reveals that the presence of sufficient levels of vitamin D prior to microbial infection contributes to effectively reduce the viability of the pathogen in MΦ.","Macrophages (MΦ) are innate immune cells that are able to kill intracellular microbes. However, the physiological levels of vitamin D and MΦ differentiation affect phenotype function and are unknown. In this study, we show that the human innate immune system consists of divergent mΦ subsets that serve distinct functions in vivo. IL-15 and IL-10 induce primary human monocytes to differentiate into antimicrobial MΥ (IL-15 MΤ) and robustly express the vitamin D pathway. In addition, we found that adding 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3) to IL-5 induced differentiation of monocytes into Mζ and increased expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, including CAMP mRNA encoded by the protein cathelyidin in dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that the presence of vitamin d and IL in M�Φ led to a significant vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial response against intracele Mycobacterium leprae infection."

In both parasite forms, transmission is dependent on exocytosis of stage-specific vesicles. In gametocytes these vesicles release proteins allowing egress from red blood cells and fertilization, and are hence needed to establish an infection in the mosquito. In contrast, proteins are secreted into the membrane of the sporozoite, where they play distinct roles during adhesion and motility, both crucial for transmission back into the mammalian host. Here we show that parasites lacking the putative small solute transporter PAT are still able to form vesicles in both parasite forms but are unable to fuse and secrete their contents. This results in impaired parasite transmission into and from the mosquito. Our work shows that a single protein can regulate the function of functionally distinct classes of vesicles in different life cycle forms of a parasite.","Malaria is a neglected tropical disease caused by the mosquito Plasmodium berghei. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito mosquito. The mosquito is responsible for the transmission of the malaria parasite to the mammalian host. During the life cycle of the mosquito, exocytosis of highly specialised secretory vesicles, osmiophilic bodies, is key for the dissolution of red blood cell and parasitophorous vacuole membranes enabling gamete egress. The positioning of adhesins in the TRAP family, micronemes on the sporozoite surface, is essential for gliding motility during parasite transmission to the mosquito and mammalian hosts. Here, we identify a conserved role for the putative pantothenate transporter PAT in the transmission process of malaria. PAT is present in distinct classes of vesicle membranes, including gametocytes and sporozoites. PAT-deficient gametes fail to discharge their contents, and remain intraerythrocytic and unavailable for fertilisation during development in the mosquito. Sporozoites lacking PAT fail to secrete TRAP, rendering them immotile and unable to infect the subsequent rodent host. Our results suggest that P. bergi PAT appears to regulate exocytic secretion of distinct populations of Vesicles in different life cycle forms acting as pantothensic transporter of parasite transmission."

These fungi can grow in soil from forests, deforested areas, sugarcane, coffee, and rice plantations, as well as pasturelands, and they are strongly associated to armadillo burrows, which can explain their frequent isolation from this mammal’s tissues. The environmental detection of these pathogens in endemic and non-endemic areas of PCM is important for mapping risk areas, as well as for understanding the infection ability and clinical manifestations of these fungi. These pieces of information are not provided by isolates obtained from human patients, because these fungi have a long latency period and the human host can migrate, leading to a misinterpretation of the actual geographic distribution of these pathogens. By using two different molecular methodologies (Nested PCR and in situ fluorescence), we detected both species of P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii in soil and in aerosol samples, even in areas where PCM is only associated to one of these two species. These data might indicate different habitat maintenance strategies between the species, which means that the infection ability may change according to the climatic and soil conditions. Despite contributing new information about the ecology of these important fungal pathogens, our molecular approach for the environmental detection of Paracoccidioides species may also be applied for their detection and differentiation in clinical samples, improving the diagnosis of this important systemic mycosis.","Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is one of the most common etiological agents of Paracoccidaidomycosis (PCM). Despite the long latency period, clinical isolates reflect the spatial distribution of the pathogens. Molecular detection of P. brasilensis and P. lutzii in soil, in isolation of wild animals and armadillos, is important for monitoring the environmental geographical distribution. In this study, we aimed to detect, time, and evaluate the genetic diversity of the species of Pc. brasiliens and Pc lutzi in endemic and non-endemic areas of the environment, using Nested PCR and situ hybridization techniques. In addition, we identified genetic variants in the soil and aerosol samples from armadillo burrows, armadilla samples, and soil samples from clinical armadilli samples, suggesting greater genetic variability in the environment than in vertebrate hosts. Our results indicate that the actual occurrence of Parcoccidios species in saprobic habitat, despite the absence/non-detection of seven armadillary species evaluated in regions with high prevalence of PCM infection, is possible."

Mechanistic explanations of our cognitive skills, be it locomotion, object handling, language comprehension or thinking in general—whatever that may be—is still far off. A few years ago the following question was posed: Imagine that aliens would provide us with a brain-sized clump of matter, with complete freedom to sculpt realistic neuronal networks with arbitrary precision. Would we be able to build a brain? The answer appears to be no, because this technology is actually materializing, not in the form of an alien kick-start, but through steady progress in computing power, simulation methods and the emergence of databases on connectivity, neural cell types, complete with gene expression, etc. A number of groups have created brain-scale simulations, others like the Blue Brain project may not have simulated a full brain, but they included almost every single detail known about the neurons they modelled. And yet, we do not know how we reach for a glass of milk.Mechanistic, large-scale models require simulations that bridge multiple scales. Here we present a method that allows the study of two dimensional dynamical systems subject to noise, with very little restrictions on the dynamical system or the nature of the noise process. Given that high dimensional realistic models of neurons have been reduced successfully to two dimensional dynamical systems, while retaining all essential dynamical features, we expect that this method will contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of larger brain networks without requiring the level of detail that make brute force large-scale simulations so unwieldy.","Neurons are highly dynamic, with a wide range of functions. However, there are limitations. Recently, extremely efficient population-level methods have been proposed for characterization of population terms in terms of a single variable. Here, we present a method for simulating neural populations based on two dimensional (2D) point spiking neuron models. The method differs from the diffusion approximation, and we reduce the state space to a single dimension (1D). The method is highly modular: variations in deterministic neural dynamics and stochastic process can be investigated independently. Currently, the trend to reduce complex high dimensional neuron models to 2D ones offers a rich dynamical repertoire available in 1D, but limit cycles. We demonstrate that the method is ideally suited to investigate noise systems, replicating the results obtained from diffusion and the generalizing regime of large jumps. We argue that the study of 2D systems subject to noise is important for complementary 1D systems."

An additional 400 million people are at risk of infection by exposure to parasite-infected insects which act as disease vectors. Trypanosomatid-borne diseases predominant in poorer nation and are considered neglected, having failed to attract the attention of the pharmaceutical industry. However, novel therapy is sorely needed for Trypanosoma and Leishmania infections, currently treated with ‘dated’ drugs that are often difficult to administer in resource-limiting conditions, have high toxicity and are by no means always successful, partly due to the emergence of drug resistance. The last few decades have witnessed a growing interest in examining the potential of bioactive toxins and poisons as drugs or drug leads, as well as for diagnostic applications. In this context, we isolated and purified crovirin, a protein from the Crotalus viridis viridis (Cvv) snake venom capable to inhibiting and/or lysing infective forms of trypanosomatid parasites, at concentrations that are not toxic to host cells. This feature makes crovirin a promising candidate protein for the development of novel therapy against neglected diseases caused by trypanosomatid pathogens.","Trypanosomatid-borne diseases are caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, we describe the purification of crovirin, a cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) from the venom of the infective trypanosomes Leishmania cruzi and trypomastigotes. Crude venom extract is loaded with reverse phase analytical (C8) column and loaded with high performance liquid chromatographer. The linear gradient of water/acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was measured. The peak containing an isolated protein (confirmed by SDS- PAGE mass spectrometry) was collected and the protein content measured. Crovirin is sensitive to the intracellular amastigote, L. amazonensis promastigot, and amatigotes in the procyclic bloodstream of trypomsomatids. The toxicity was tested in LLC-MK2 cells, peritoneal macrophages and isolated from the murine extensor digitorum longus muscle. The purified single protein of Cvv venom was corresponding to CRISP 24,893.64 Da, henceforth referred to as crovirins.

This allows TBSV to utilize the existing actin filaments to efficiently recruit host proteins and lipids for viral replication and to build viral replication compartments for robust viral replication. Altogether, subversion of the actin network by TBSV is a key step for the virus to gain access to cellular resources required for virus replication.","The tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) infects host cells by co-opt host factors and lipids escaping host antiviral responses.

As the mechanism of such regulation, widely accepted has been the notion of the intraembryonic distribution of regulatory molecules called “morphogens”. One of the best-studied morphogens is Bicoid in the early developmental stage of the Drosophila embryo. Synthesized around the anterior pole of the embryo, Bicoid forms an exponential gradient of concentration to initiate expression of a target gene, hunchback, in nuclei at the periphery of the embryo. This invariably forms a concentration boundary of the product protein Hunchback at around 49% embryo length. Remarkably, the embryo-embryo variability in the boundary position is less than 5%. Reactions in embryos, however, should be intrinsically noisy because the number of molecules involved is small, and those reactions are governed by randomly diffusing molecules. The mechanisms to generate the invariable Hunchback distribution by filtering the intense noise remain mysterious, and here we construct models to shed light on this problem. Stochastic simulations show that the slow diffusion of Hunchback averages out the intense noise, so that the coordinated rates of diffusion and transport of input Bicoid and output Hunchback play decisive roles in suppressing fluctuations.","Precise patterning of morphogen molecules is a key aspect of embryonic development. Recent experiments have visualized the distributions of proteins in developing embryos. The gradient concentration of the Bicoid morphogen in Drosophila embryos established rapidly during fertilization remains stable in syncytial mitoses. However, the precise distribution of the Hunchback protein is not well understood. Here, we show that the gradient concentration in the D. melanogaster embryo can be read in a precise way, and that this is achieved in a reproducible way, by small embryo-to-embryonic fluctuation. The mechanisms underlying stable, precise, reproducible patterning in noisy cellular processes, however, remain mysterious. To address these issues, we develop one-dimensional stochastic models of early development of the early embryo. We simulated the fluctuation of the expression of the hunchback gene dominated by the random arrival of the bicoid protein enhancer enhancer. Slow diffusion of the protein, which averages intense fluctuation, leading to a precise patterning distribution of Hunchbacks and loss of sharpness in the boundary distribution. We show that coordinated rates of diffusion transport and input of the input of Bicoids and Hunchunchback play decisive roles in suppressing fluctuations arising from dynamical structure change in the embryos arising from random diffusion molecules, and rise to a stable, and reproducible, patterning for the early D. mellogaster."

Current treatment regimens require administration of multiple drugs over several months and resistance to these drugs is on the rise. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the disease, can proliferate within host cells. It has been recently observed that autophagy (cellular self-eating) can kill intracellular M. tuberculosis. We report that the antiprotozoal drug nitazoxanide and its metabolite tizoxanide induce autophagy, inhibit signaling by mTORC1, a major negative regulator of autophagy, and prevent M. tuberculosis proliferation in infected macrophages. We show that nitazoxanide exerts at least some of its pharmacological effects by targeting the quinone reductase NQO1. Our results uncover a novel mechanism of action for the drug nitazoxanide, and show that pharmacological modulation of autophagy can suppress intracellular M. tuberculosis proliferation.","Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world today. M. tuberculosis hijacks the phagosome-lysosome trafficking pathway to escape clearance from infected macrophages. There is increasing evidence that manipulation of autophagy, a regulated catabolic trafficking pathway, may enhance the killing of M. TB. In this study, we report that the antiprotozoal drug nitazoxanide, an active metabolite of tizoxanides, is able to inhibit the signaling of mTORC1, a major negative regulator of the autophagosome pathway. We show that this drug has similar strict structural requirements and activity to autophagic induction, EGFP-LC3 processing and mTORc1 inhibition. We also show that NQO1 inhibition is partly responsible for the inhibition of the signaling pathway. This dual action of nitazoyanide in the host cell response to infection may lead to improved tuberculosis treatment."

The main route of transmission of HTBMb is the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, causing mostly extrapulmonary disease. M. bovis is naturally resistant to pyrazinamide, a drug that allows for a shorter treatment course. Therefore, if M. bovis is not properly identified or if there is resistance to other drugs, proper treatment may be hindered. Most laboratories in developing countries do not routinely perform mycobacterial cultures, and only a few laboratories can identify M. bovis. Therefore, HTBMb cases are believed to be underestimated. We report a large proportion of M. bovis isolates and an increasing isolation trend across time. We report a large proportion of M. bovis isolates from pulmonary samples, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human airborne transmission. Also, we showed that M. bovis isolates were more frequently resistant to streptomycin, perhaps as a result of antibiotic usage in cattle. This work underscores the need for identification to the species level, proper susceptibility testing, as well as a stricter control of bovine tuberculosis.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes the majority of tuberculosis (TB) cases in humans; however, in developing countries, human TB caused by M. bovis is more frequent and undetected.

The increasing availability of genomic variation maps of human as well as of model organism populations (mouse and Arabidopsis) constitutes an important step towards meeting this challenge. However, despite its excellent track record as a premier model to understand genome function, no genome-wide variation data beyond single-nucleotide variants and microsatellites are currently available for D. melanogaster. Here, we present a comprehensive, nucleotide-resolution catalogue of variants of various types (single-nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and structural variants) for 39 wild-derived inbred D. melanogaster lines based on high-throughput sequencing. This catalogue confirms that non–SNP variants account for more than half of genomic variation, allowing us to provide new insights into the non-random distribution of variants in the Drosophila genome. We further present genome-wide cis-associations with gene expression based on whole adult fly microarray data, revealing significant associations for about 2,000 genes. Most associations are sex-specific, providing evidence for a decoupling of the genomic, regulatory architecture between males and females.","The relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic variation is one of the great outstanding challenges in biology.

We investigated 131 lifestyle factors, of which 15 influence the genetic effects on BMI. The most significant factors were those related to physical activity, alcohol consumption, and socioeconomic status. For example, the effect of a genetic score for BMI was almost twice as high in participants who reported never drinking alcohol compared to every-day drinkers. Similarly, the effect of the genetic score for BMI was 2.5 times higher in participants who reported having a slow walking pace compared to participants who reported having a brisk walking pace.

This event leads to a series of biochemical reactions involving the receptor and signalling molecules, and ultimately a cellular response. Surface receptors are mobile on the cell surface and their mobility is influenced by their interaction with intracellular proteins. We wish to understand the details of these interactions and how they are affected by cellular activation. An experimental technique called single particle tracking (SPT) uses optical microscopy to study the motion of cell-surface receptors, revealing important details about the organization of the cell membrane. In this paper, we propose a new method of analyzing SPT data to identify reduced receptor mobility as a result of transient binding to intracellular proteins. Using our analysis we are able to reliably differentiate receptor motion when a receptor is freely diffusing on the membrane versus when it is interacting with an intracellular protein. By observing the frequency of transitions between free and bound states, we are able to estimate reaction rates for the interaction. We apply our method to the receptor LFA-1 in T cells and draw conclusions about its interactions with the T cell cytoskeleton.","Single-particle experiments are an important step in the understanding of the molecular processes involved in the development of complex biological systems. However, it is not clear how many states of diffusion are involved in these experiments. We developed a practical technique capable of identifying multiple states in the diffusion of experimental trajectories. We show that a single particle tracks a membrane-associated protein interacting with a homogeneously distributed binding partner, and that certain simplifying assumptions, particle trajectories are regarded as the outcome-state hidden Markov model. Using simulated trajectories, we demonstrate that the model can identify key biophysical parameters of the system, diffusion coefficients underlying states, and rates of transition.

Here we use these sequences to perform the first in-depth computational analysis of a large body of IRESs, in which we explore RNA sequence features predictive of their activity. Our analyses provide insights on the effect of short RNA sequences on IRES activity, including their composition, number and position. We identified pyrimidine-rich sequence features resembling several known IRES Trans-Acting Factor (ITAF) binding motifs as predictive across human and viral IRESs, and discovered that their effect on IRES activity is strongest at distinct positions upstream of the start codon. Together, our results yield a high-level IRES architecture of sequence features and their spatial organization in RNA sequence, suggesting optimal positioning of ITAF binding sites, bringing us closer towards predicting protein levels from RNA sequence.","Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESs) are a group of RNA-binding sites that are essential for cellular viral initiation.

Most synaptic receptors consist of several proteins, each having several variants coded by closely related genes. These protein variants are similar in structure, yet often differ slightly in their biophysical attributes. Switching a synapse from using one variant to another provides the brain with a way to fine-tune electrophysiological properties of synapses and has been described in NMDA and GABA receptors. Here we describe a systematic approach to detect pairs of context-dependent variants at a genome-wide scale based on a set of post-mortem expression measurements taken from brains at multiple ages. We take into account both the profile of expression as it changes along life and also the detrended age-corrected correlation among genes. This method characterizes the landscape of developmental switches in brain transcriptome, putting forward new candidates pairs for deeper analysis. The abundance of switching between context-dependent variants through life suggests that it is a major mechanism by which the brain tunes its plasticity and information processing.","Synaptic receptors in the human brain consist of multiple protein subunits, multiple variants, coded by different genes, differentially expressed in different brain regions during developmental stages. The brain can tune the electrophysiological properties of synapses and regulate the plasticity of information processing by switching a protein variant. The condition-dependent variant switch during development has been demonstrated in neurotransmitter systems including NMDA and GABA. Here, we systematically detect pairs of receptor-subunit variants that switch over the lifetime of a human brain analyzing postmortem expression data collected from a population of donors at different ages of brain regions measured in microarray RNA-seq. We show that the age-correct expression correlation face strong temporal trends. We also show that this correlation can be seen in a nonlinear version of partial correlations. These methods can be used to detect multiple new pairs of context dependent variants. For instance, we find that the switch between GLRA2 and GLRA3 differs from the known switch in the rat. Finally, we detect that the early switch between HTR1A and HTR5A is negatively correlated with age- corrected expression. These results provide a systematic map of developmental switching in the neurotransmitter system in the Human brain."

While some mutations affect an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce, most are neutral and have no effect. Neutral mutations play an important role in the study of evolution because they generally accrue at a consistent rate over time. This result, first discovered 50 years ago, allows neutral mutations to be used as a “molecular clock” to estimate, for example, how long ago humans diverged from chimpanzees and bonobos. We used mathematical modeling to study how the rates of these molecular clocks are affected by the spatial arrangement of a population in its habitat. We find that asymmetry in this spatial structure can either slow down or speed up the rate at which neutral mutations accrue. This effect could potentially skew our estimates of past events from genetic data. It also has implications for a number of other fields. For example, we show that the architecture of intestinal tissue can limit the rate of genetic substitutions leading to cancer. We also show that the structure of social networks affects the rate at which new ideas replace old ones. Surprisingly, we find that most Twitter networks slow down the rate of idea replacement.","When a population acquires neutral genetic substitutions, it is a consequence of random drift. The famous result of population genetics asserts that the rate at which these substitutions accumulate in the population coincides with the mutation rate, u, that arise in individuals: K = u. The molecular clock is known to be perturbed by selection, thought to hold generally neutral evolution. However, asymmetric spatial population structure can alter the molecular clock rate of neutral mutations, leading to K < u K > u. We apply our model to a general class of haploid, asexually reproducing, spatially structured populations. We show that the mutations arise unequally at different sites with different probabilities of fixation depending on the mutations that arise. We also show that birth rates are uniform at uniform sites, K ≤ u. general, and K value 0 Nu. This model can be applied to a variety of population structures. For example, we investigate the accumulation of genetic mutations in the small intestine. In this application, we analyze 900 Twitter networks to study the effect of network topology on fixation and neutral innovations in social evolution."

Therefore, the replication strategies of viruses may provide not only the understanding of virus pathogenesis but also useful models to disentangle the complex machinery of host cells. Translation regulation of viral mRNA is a good example of this. Borna disease virus (BDV) is a highly neurotropic RNA virus which is characterized by persistent infection. BDV expresses mRNAs as polycistronic coding transcripts. Among them, the 0.8 kb X/P mRNA encodes at least three open reading frames (ORFs), upstream ORF, X, and P. Although BDV X and P have opposing effects in terms of viral polymerase activity, the translational regulation of X/P polycistronic mRNA has not been elucidated. In this study, we show an ingenious strategy of translational control of viral regulatory protein using host factors. We demonstrate that host RNA helicases, mainly DDX21, can affect ribosomal reinitiation of X via interaction with the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of X/P mRNA and that the downstream P protein autogenously controls the translation of X by interfering with the binding of DDX21 to the 5′ UTR. Our findings uncover not only a unique translational control of viral regulatory protein but also a previously unknown mechanism of translational regulation of polycistronic mRNA using RNA helicases.","Borna disease virus (BDV) is a nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus that employs unique strategies for gene expression. The shortest transcript of BDV, X/P mRNA, encodes open reading frames (ORFs) that encodes the upstream ORF (uORF), X, and P in the 5′ 3′ direction. The X ORF is a negative regulator of viral polymerase activity, and the P phosphoprotein is a cofactor polymerase complex, suggesting that translation of X is controlled rigorously, depending on viral replication. However, the translation mechanism of X and P of polycistronic mRNA is not determined in detail. Here, we demonstrate that X or P mRNA autogenously regulates the translation of the X and interaction with host factors. Transfection of cDNA clones corresponding to X /P mRNA revealed that X ORFs are translated predominantly by uORF- termination-combined reinitiation, and efficiency upregulated by P. We found that P enhance ribosomal reinitsiation by the XORF and inhibition of the interaction between the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 and the 3′ untranslated region of X/PG mRNA, and that P inhibits phosphorylation of X. These results demonstrate a unique translational control of a viral regulatory protein, and elucidate a previously unknown mechanism of the regulation of the transcription of RNA helicases."

Recently, it was shown that the protein H-NS selectively silences genes gained by horizontal transfer in enteric bacteria. Regulated expression of these genes can then evolve and be integrated into the regulatory network of the new host. Our analysis of the catabolic bgl (aryl-β,D-glucoside) operon, which is silenced by H-NS in E. coli, provides a snapshot on the evolution of such a locus. Genes of the bgl operon were presumably gained by horizontal transfer from Gram-positive bacteria to ancestral enteric bacteria. In E. coli, the bgl operon co-evolved with the diversification of the species into four phylogenetic groups. In one phylogenetic group the bgl operon is functional. However, in two other phylogenetic groups, bgl accumulates disrupting mutations, and it is absent in the fourth group. This indicates that the H-NS–silenced bgl operon evolved differently in E. coli and is presumably positively selected in one phylogenetic group, while it is neutrally or negatively selected in the other groups.","Enterobacterial species, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, express horizontally acquired genes with higher average content than those repressed by the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS.

The locus is “ cryptic,” and laboratory growth conditions are known to relieve the repression of bgl by H-Nucleoside. However, repression is relieved by spontaneous mutations. Here, we investigated the phylogeny of the bgl operon. Typing bgl from a representative collection of bacteria from the genus Enterobacterium revealed that it evolved in clonally present strains from three phylogenetic groups, B1, B2, and presumably replaced a cluster of ORFans in the phylogenetic group D. Interestingly, bgl was mutated in 20% of strains from the two groups, suggesting a functional role for bgl in the extraintestinal pathogenic bacteria."

If untreated, symptomatic VL leads to systemic pathologies and is usually fatal. Up to approximately 400,000 new cases are estimated to occur annually, and regional epidemics have been devastatingly severe. Diagnosis of clinically suspect cases in the field, and thus appropriate treatment, relies principally on a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) based on detection of antibodies against a Leishmania antigen known as rK39. Although this test is reliable in South Asia, it has shown less success in East Africa. One reason may reside in diversity of the rK39 homologue among East African L. donovani, with consequent limitations in the binding of diagnostic antibodies. Here, we investigate the sequences of rK39 homologues in a panel of East African L. donovani strains, and show that there is significant diversity compared to rK39 and to South Asian sequences. Additionally, we examine diversity in another diagnostic antigen known as HASPB1/2. Our results indicate that an improved RDT may need to encompass East-African-specific antigen diversity to provide high performance field diagnosis for this region.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by infection with Leishmania donovani complex, remains a major public health problem in endemic regions of South Asia, East Africa, and Brazil. Rapid field diagnosis relies principally on the demonstration of anti-Leishmania antibodies against clinically suspect cases. The rK39 immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is based on a fragment of a kinesin-related gene derived from Brazilian L. chagasi, and recognised by L. infantum, originating from Europe. Despite the reliability of the RDT, it has been reported to have lower sensitivity in East Africa. The reason for this differential response may reside in the molecular diversity of the sequences in East African and South Asian strains. Coding sequences of the rk39 homologues from East African L. donovan strains were amplified and amplified and compared to genomic DNA, and analysed the diversity of these sequences. East African sequences revealed significant diversity in the rK40 sequence, with multiple substitutions involving charge changes, amino acid substitutions and 3′ half repeats conservative. Specific polymorphisms were found in South Asian and East African strains. Diversity in HASPB1 and HASPB2 gene repeat sequences, flank sequences and the Kinesin homologue of the synthetic antigen rK28 designed to reduce variable RDT performance, was investigated. Non-canonical combination repeat arrangements were revealed to be responsible for the differences in the kinesins in strains producing unpredicted size amplicons. This study provides new insights into the molecular and genetic diversity of strains from East Africa to East Africa and South Asia and highlights the importance of targeted comparative genomics guiding optimisation of recombinant/synthetic diagnostic antigens."

Here, we develop a mathematical framework to study the underlying causes of a bursting phenomenon in network activity known as avalanching. As prototypical examples, we study a model of disease spreading in a population of individuals and a model of brain activity in a neural network. Although avalanching is well-documented in neural networks, thought to be crucial for learning, information processing, and memory, it has not been studied before in disease spreading. We employ tools originally used to analyze thermodynamic systems to argue that randomness in the actions of individual network components plays a fundamental role in avalanche formation. We show that avalanching is a spontaneous behavior, brought about by a phenomenon reminiscent to a phase transition in statistical mechanics, caused by increasing randomness as the network size decreases. Our work demonstrates that a previously suggested balanced feed-forward network structure is not necessary for neuronal avalanching. Instead, we attribute avalanching to a reallocation of the global minima of the network's stationary potential energy landscape, caused by a noise-induced deformation of its topographic surface.","The role of intrinsic statistical fluctuations in creating avalanches – patterns of complex bursting activity with scale-free properties – has been examined in leaky Markovian networks. We develop a probabilistic approach that employs a potential energy landscape perspective coupled with macroscopic description based on statistical thermodynamics. We identify important thermodynamic quantities essential for characterizing system behavior and function in network size: internal potential and energy, entropy, free potential energy, internal pressure, pressure, bulk modulus. In agreement with classical phase transitions, quantities evolve smoothly to function at the critical value reached. We attribute a novel result of reallocation of ground states (global minima) to a system stationary potential of energy landscape caused by a noise-induced deformation of the topographic surface. Our analysis demonstrates that appreciable levels of intrinsic noise can cause avalanching, a complex mode of operation that dominates system dynamics at near-critical subcritical network sizes. In the epidemiological model of bacterial infection and computational neuroscience, avalanchings are erroneously attributed to specific neural architectures. In general, general methods have been developed to study the emergence of avalanches (complex phenomena) in biological, physical, and man-interacting networks."

This corresponds to the boundaries of the ancient continent of Sahul, which broke up due to rising sea levels about 9000 years before present. The distribution of languages in this region conveys information about its population history. The recent migration of the Austronesian speakers can be traced with precision, but the histories of the Papuan and Australian language speakers are considerably more difficult to reconstruct. The speakers of these languages are presumably descendants of the first migrations into Sahul, and their languages have been subject to many millennia of dispersal and contact. Due to the antiquity of these language families, there is insufficient lexical evidence to reconstruct their histories. Instead we use abstract structural features to infer population history, modeling language change as a result of both inheritance and horizontal diffusion. We use a Bayesian phylogenetic clustering method, originally developed for investigating genetic recombination to infer the contribution of different linguistic lineages to the current diversity of languages. The results show the underlying structure of the diversity of these languages, reflecting ancient dispersals, millennia of contact, and probable phylogenetic groups. The analysis identifies 10 ancestral language populations, some of which can be identified with previously known phylogenetic groups (language families or subgroups), and some of which have not previously been proposed.","The ancient Sahul continent (present day Australia and New Guinea, and surrounding islands) is home to extreme linguistic diversity. The Austronesian language family, which spread over the area of the Sahul region during the Holocene, has hundreds of languages apparently unrelated to each other. In subcontinents, the generally accepted classification recognizes a large, widespread family number that is unrelatable to smaller families. In this study, we inferred the history and structural characteristics of languages in the admixture model, which was originally developed to discover populations on the basis of recombining genetic markers. Our results show traces of early dispersals, including hints of ancient connections between Australian languages and Papuan groups (long hypothesized, demonstrated). Systematic language contact effects on members of big phylogenetic groups were detected, but cases were identified as a diffusional substrate signal. Interestingly, there remains striking evidence of a phylogenetic signal, with languages showing negligible amounts of admixture."

These elements contribute to genome instability, control of host gene expression and adaptation to changing environments. Retrotransposons depend on numerous host factors for their own propagation and control. The retrovirus-like retrotransposon, Ty1, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an invaluable model for retrotransposon research, and hundreds of host factors that regulate Ty1 retrotransposition have been identified. Non-essential subunits of the Mediator transcriptional co-activator complex have been identified as one set of host factors implicated in Ty1 regulation. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the effects of loss of these non-essential subunits of Mediator on Ty1 retrotransposition. Our findings reveal a heretofore unknown mechanism by which Mediator influences the balance between transcription from two promoters in Ty1 to modulate expression of an autoinhibitory transcript known as Ty1i RNA. Our results provide new insights into host control of retrotransposon activity via promoter choice and elucidate a novel mechanism by which the Mediator co-activator governs this choice.","Ty1 retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that replicate in RNA intermediates and constitute a significant portion of eukaryotic genomes. Ty1 is regulated by numerous host factors, including subunits of the Mediator transcriptional co-activator complex. In spite of its known function in the nucleus, previous studies have implicated Mediator regulation of post-translational steps of Ty1 retromobility. To resolve this paradox, we systematically examined the effects of deleting non-essential Mediator subunits on the frequency and level of both Ty1 and RNA intermediate levels. Our findings reveal that loss of distinct Mediator Subunits alters the Ty1-mediated ratio of internal transcript, Ty1i, to genomic Ty1 transcript. We also show that the loss of the dominant negative inhibitor Ty1 inhibits the growth of virus-like particle maturation and cDNA synthesis.

Protein folding, the complex, concerted motion of a protein chain towards a unique three-dimensional structure, is one example of where such reduction of complexity is useful. It is usually assumed that the projected dynamics is diffusive. However, many experiments and simulations have shown that the projected dynamics is sub-diffusive, i.e., the mean square displacement grows slower than linear with time. It means that the dynamics has a memory; that the free energy surface together with diffusion coefficient do not properly define the dynamics; and that such projections cannot be used to accurately describe dynamics. Here, we show that if one carefully constructs the reaction coordinate by optimizing (maximizing) its free energy profile, one can use a simple (memory-less) diffusive description. Loosely speaking, when the complex dynamics is projected onto a simple coordinate, all the complexity of the original dynamics goes into the memory of the projected dynamics. If the dynamics is projected onto the (complex) optimum reaction coordinate, all the complexity of the original dynamics is in the reaction coordinate, and the projected dynamics is simple.","Protein folding dynamics are described by the diffusion free energy surface, which is considered as a function of reaction coordinates. However, a growing number of experiments have shown that the projected reaction coordinate is sub-diffusive. This raises the question of whether the conventionally diffusive description of dynamics is adequate. Here, we numerically construct the optimum reaction coordinate for a long equilibrium folding trajectory of a model-repressor protein. The trajectory projected to the optimal reaction coordinate exhibits diffusive dynamics, but dynamics trajectory projected at the sub-optimal reaction coordinate are sub- diffusive. We show that the higher (cut-based) free energy profile of the putative reaction coordinate, the more diffusive the dynamics trajectory at the projected coordinate. Our results suggest that projected dynamics are diffusive and sub-distusive depends on the chosen reaction coordinate."

However, categorization is complicated because an object can belong to multiple categories. Thus, to inform our categorical judgments, we must make use of prior information. Given the importance of categorization, we hypothesized that humans utilize optimal strategies for making categorical judgments that allow us to minimize categorization errors. We found, though, that whereas subjects used prior information (i.e., category prior probability), they were sub-optimal in their categorization behavior. This seems to be common in other perceptual and cognitive tasks as well. We then explored the bases for this sub-optimal behavior and found that it can be consistent with an optimal strategy if we assume that subjects have trial-by-trial noise in components of the judgment process. This work extends previous similar findings into the field of auditory categorization and provides a means to reinterpret previous results.","Categorization is an important cognitive process in humans. However, it has been extensively studied in vision, and the analogous phenomenon of audition has been systematically explored. In this study, we test whether human subjects learn to use category distributions prior to making auditory-category decisions. We asked subjects to classify the frequency of tone burst in overlapping, uniform categories according to perceived tone frequency. We systematically varied the prior probability presenting tone burst frequency from originating versus category. We found that subjects learned changes in prior probabilities in early testing information that influence categorization behavior. We also tested subject average behavior and found that variations in the Bayesian model led to optimal sub-optimal decision behavior (i.e. probability matching). We also found that probability matching provided a better account of human decision behavior. Finally, we systematically explored potential ways that additional noise sources may influence categorizing behavior. Our work extends previous findings in the auditory domain and reformulates the issue of categorization in a manner that can help interpret the results of previous research in a generative framework."

Slow inhibition curtailed spread projection neuron activity increased response reliability . competing influences finely balanced order decorrelate odor representations .","The antennal lobe of insects and the olfactory bulb of vertebrates represent the first centers of the olfactory system where information about odor properties can be reorganized and optimized for further processing. Complex excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions within the antennal lobe and the olfactory bulb alter the responses of the principal neurons throughout the duration of the odor stimulation. These dynamic changes progressively increase the difference between firing patterns evoked by structurally similar odors, potentially helping the animal distinguish one odor from another. However, this process, called odor decorrelation, appears to oppose another important goal of olfactory processing, to minimize the inevitable noisy variations in representations of the same odor encountered under different environmental conditions; such variations could potentially lead to misclassification. It remains an interesting mystery how olfactory circuitry can solve these two seemingly contradictory goals as they process olfactory stimuli: first, separating different but chemically similar odors (sensitivity, capacity); and second, identifying representations of the same odor in a noisy environment (reliability). Our results suggest a balance between inhibitory and excitatory connections mediated by local antennal lobe interneurons enhances the decorrelation of similar odors while keeping the representation robust in the presence of noise.","Neurons in the insect antennal lobe represent odors in spatiotemporal patterns that unfold over multiple time scales. These patterns unspool and decrease overlap between odor representations, which increase the ability of the olfactory system to discriminate odors. In this study, we examined two competing components of this process – lateral excitation and local excitatory interneurons, and slow inhibition of local inhibitory interneuron activity. We found that lateral excitations amplified differences in representations of similar odors recruiting projection neurons to receive direct input from olfaction receptors. Slow inhibition curtailed the spread of projection neuron activity and increased response reliability. These competing influences were finely balanced in order to decorrelate odor representations."

The movement or the roughness of its surface causes the wave fronts to interfere and produce a pattern of moving dots that resemble boiling water. This research describes the application of Biospeckle to Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The purpose was to observe the movement of the Biospeckle dots and to detect differences depending on the presence of the parasite, the quantity of the parasite and the conditions of the parasites when they are affected by a drug. We designed a method using VDRL plates where the sample has a relatively small volume and is flat shaped, a laser, a camera and a lens. The Biospeckle pattern is recorded in a video in a computer and shows the Biospeckle dots which move rapidly as the concentration of parasites increases and less rapidly as the concentration decreases or as the parasites are affected by a drug such as benznidazole. We designed algorithms which take the difference between successive frames and expressed them in a program in Java, in a script in R Commander and SAGA and in ImageJ. Thus we obtained a quantitative description of the movement of T. cruzi.","Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of malaria in Latin America. The parasite is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito. It is transmitted by a single bite of an infected mosquito, which is then killed by a pro-drug agent. It has been shown that the parasite can be killed by the drug benznidazole, but the mechanism of action is not well understood. In this paper, we report a quantitative laser Biospeckle method for monitoring parasite activity in VDRL plates. The method is based on a combination of image processing algorithms (RCommander/SAGA), image processing, and image processing. We test the effect of variable concentrations on the activity of the parasite. The effect is better detected after 1 hour of drug action. The behavior is explained by the instantaneous effect of the membrane protein Trypanosomatous cruzi mediate translocation of benznitazole. The longer times effect is possibly explained by required transformation of the pro-Drug active drug."

This origin of biological information is akin to the crystallization of ice from water, where ‘order’ emerges from ‘disorder.’ What does the science of such phase transformations tell us about the emergence of genomes? In this paper, we show that such thermodynamic considerations of RNA synthesis, when combined with kinetics and population dynamics, lead to the conclusion that the ‘crystallization’ of genomes from its basic elements would have been spontaneous for RNAs, but not necessarily for other potential building blocks of genomes in the prebiotic soup.","The RNA world hypothesis views modern organisms as descendants of RNA molecules. Since the earliest RNA molecules were random sequences, genomes coded by polymerase and ribozymes have emerged. The quasispecies theory of Eigen predicts the existence of an error threshold limiting genomic stability and transitions, and to address the spontaneity of changes. Following a recent theoretical approach, we applied this theory to kinetic/therodynamic descriptions of RNA replication to analyze the collective behavior of RNA replicators based on known experimental kinetics data. We find that increasing fidelity (relative rate of base-extension and Watson-Crick versus mismatched base pairs) increases the fitness of replications of enzymes, ribosymes, and protein-based polymerases, near the critical point, respectively. In large regions of the phase diagram, fitness increases with increasing fidelity, biasing random drifts of sequence space into ‘crystallization.’ This region encloses the experimental nonenzymatic fidelity value, favoring evolutions of polymerase sequences with higher fidelity, despite the error rates and the error catastrophe threshold. Our work shows that experimentally characterized kinetics and thermodynamics of RNAs can allow to determine physicochemical conditions required for spontaneous crystallization of biological information."

The difficulty has been that there are a large number of variables (known and unknown) that combine through an extensive array of possible mechanisms. Differences in the affinity of a binding site for its cognate binder within the initiation complex are known to account for significant differences in promoter output, but data for the activity of binding site variants in vivo has been limited. Here, we were able to map the fitness of nearly all E. coli   binding sites in multiple promoter and environmental contexts using a novel method that utilizes the sequencing power of a next generation DNA sequencer. These data for the first time show the phenotypic range and continuity of a nearly complete set of possible binding targets in vivo, and they are useful in our ability to understand the mechanism, evolution, and designability of gene regulation.","The nature of the interaction between transcription factors and target sequences in vitro is not sufficiently understood to allow the effects of DNA sequence alterations on gene expression to be accurately predicted. In this study, we measured the relative fitness of nearly all Escherichia coli    binding sites in different promoter environmental contexts, competing for control of the expression of the tetracycline resistance gene (t tet) by increasing concentrations of a drug. We observed a consistent relationship between the frequency and recovery of the −35 binding site predicted for affinity   varied depending on the sequence context and promoter drug concentration. Overall, the rate of transcriptional initiation (fitness) was dependent on the overall stability of the initiation complex, which in turn was dependent upon the energetic contributions of sites in the complex. Furthermore, we observed that a large continuous range in transcriptional outputs can be accessed merely by merely changing, suggesting that evolved engineered mutations in the site may allow subtle and precise control of gene expression."

An initial step in the expression of proteins is transcription, which is mediated by RNA polymerase II (pol-II). To understand changes in transcription arising due to stimuli it is useful to model the dynamics of transcription. We present a probabilistic model of pol-II transcription dynamics that can be used to compute RNA transcription speed and infer the temporal pol-II activity at the gene promoter. The inferred promoter activity profile is used to determine genes that are responding in a coordinated manner to stimuli and are therefore potentially co-regulated. Model parameters are inferred using data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as ChIP-Seq and GRO-Seq, and can therefore be applied genome-wide in an unbiased manner.

We estimate transcription speed using a Bayesian inference of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The Bayesian approach provides confidence intervals for parameter estimates and allows use of priors to capture domain knowledge, e.g. expected range of transcription speeds, based on previous experiments. Our model describes the movement of the pol-I gene body and identifies the time of induction of transcriptionally engaged genes. By clustering inferred promoter activity time profiles, we are able to determine genes that respond quickly to stimuli in which a group of genes share activity profiles that are co-regulated. We apply our methodology to biological data obtained from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells treated with estradiol (E2). We find that rapidly induced genes are enriched with estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and FOXA1 binding at proximal promoter regions."

As all DNA based processes, including transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair, occur within the context of chromatin, the actual in vivo substrate of these reactions is chromatin. Thus, understanding these processes within the context of chromatin is vital for providing mechanistic insights into chromatin-based processes, including DNA damage signaling and genome maintenance. Here we identify a structure within H2A and H2AX termed the acidic patch that promotes the activity of two independent ubiquitin E3 ligase complexes, RNF168 and RING1B/BMI1, and is required for DNA damage ubiquitin signaling. We show directly in vitro and in vivo that this nucleosome structure is critical for histone H2A and H2AX ubiquitinations and the DNA damage response in cells. In addition, we engineered a novel biological tool that blocked the nucleosome acidic patch of all histone H2A species leading to the repression of the DNA damage response in cells. Collectively, DNA damage factors elicit their response not only through histone modifications such as ubiquitin but also through interactions within nucleosome surface structures to activate DNA damage signaling.","Histone ubiquitination is critical for the activation of the DNA damage response (DDR). In particular, RNF168 and RING1B/BMI1 function in DDR by ubiquitinating H2A/H2AX Lys-13/15 and Lys-118/119, respectively. However, it remains unclear how the ubiquitin pathway engages chromatin to provide the regulation of ubiquitins targeting specific histone residues. Here, we identify the nucleosome acid patch as a critical chromatin mediator of H2a/h2AX ubiquitinated ( ub). We show that the acidic patch is required for H2AXub-dependent DNA damage responses including 53BP1 and BRCA1 recruitment to DNA damage. The acidic patch functions as a scaffold to integrate multiple ubiquititin signals into chromatin and compose selective ubiquitinations of histones and DNA damage signaling."

Effective management of mosquito-borne pathogens like Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) requires an understanding of the roles that different mosquito species and vertebrate hosts play in transmission. This study combines data on mosquito transmission efficiency, mosquito feeding patterns, and vertebrate infectiousness to quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of different mosquito species and vertebrate hosts to the amplification of RVFV in the U.S. We identify several species of floodwater Aedes spp. mosquitoes that would be the most likely vectors for RVFV, and hoofed ungulates (deer, cows, sheep) would be the most important amplifying vertebrate hosts. Although these data provide public and animal health agencies a priori knowledge on the primary mosquitoes that should be targeted for vector control and the highest priority animals to receive vaccines, this analysis reveals many gaps in knowledge reducing our ability to predict and then manage a potential invasion of RVFV.","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne virus that is transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes in the genus Bunyaviridiae. The establishment of RVFV in North America has significant consequences for human and animal health in addition to a significant economic impact on the livestock industry. Here, we use published and unpublished data from mosquito transmission studies to quantitatively implicate mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts as important hosts for RVFFV transmission in the United States. Our study identifies critical gaps in knowledge about mosquito vector competence, vertebrate host competence, and mosquito feeding patterns in the U.S. and identifies the critical gaps that are necessary for complete comprehensive analysis of the different contributions of mosquitoes and vertebrates to potential pathogen transmission.

One of the most fundamental steps in analyzing these microbial communities is matching the microbial marker genes in environmental samples with existing databases to determine which microbes are present. The current techniques for doing this analysis are either slow or closed-source. We present an alternative technique that takes advantage of a high-speed Burrows-Wheeler alignment procedure combined with rapid filtering and parsing of the data to remove bottlenecks in the pipeline. We achieve an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional techniques without sacrificing accuracy or memory use, and in some cases improving both significantly. Thus our method allows more biologists to process their own sequencing data without specialized computing resources, and it obtains more accurate and even optimal taxonomic annotation for their marker gene sequencing data.","Genome sequencing is a powerful tool for understanding the biology of the human gut microbiome.

Current understanding of the genetic basis for these gaits is limited to one known mutation apparently necessary, but not sufficient, for explaining variability in “gaitedness.” The Standardbred breed includes two distinct groups, trotters, which exhibit a two-beat gait in which the opposite forelimb and hind limb move together, and pacers, which exhibit an alternative two-beat gait where the legs on the same side of the body move together. Our long-term objective is to identify variants underlying the ability of certain Standardbreds to pace. In this study, we were able to identify several regions of the genome highly associated with pacing and, within these regions, a number of specific highly associated variants. Although the biological function of these variants has yet to be determined, we developed a model based on seven variants that was > 99% accurate in predicting whether an individual was a pacer or a trotter in two independent populations. This predictive model can be used by horse owners to make breeding and training decisions related to this economically important trait, and by scientists interested in understanding the biology of coordinated gait development.","Many horse breeds are specifically selected for their ability to exhibit alternative patterns of locomotion, gaits, and speed. However, the premature stop codon gene DMRT3 is the most prevalent gene in the “ gaitedness” breeds. This mutation is nearly fixed in American Standardbred trotters and pacers, which perform diagonal lateral gait, respectively, in harness racing. Here, we show that modifying alleles influence the preferred gait and speed of these populations. We show that a genome-wide association analysis of ability to pace is performed on 542 Standardbred horses (n = 176 pacers and n = 366 trotter) and genotype data imputed ~74,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Nineteen SNPs were found on 22 chromosomes (ECA1, 2, 6, 9, 17, 19, 23, 25, 31). We found 303 variants in 22 chromosomes that were putative modifying effects on gait genotyped in 659 Standardbreds. Random forest classification analysis resulted in a box-to-box error rate of 0.61% and a conditional inference tree algorithm containing seven SNPs predicted the status of a pacer and trottter with 99.1% accuracy. We subsequently performed 99.4% accuracy independently sampled from a population of 166 Standardbredbreds, n = 83 pacers. Our highly accurate algorithm can be used by owners/trains to identify horses that are potential race pacers or troters and enable fine-tuning breeding programs designed for matings. Additional work is needed to determine the algorithm utility of gaited breeds and to determine whether predictive SNPs play a physiologically functional role in the tendency to pace."

In turn, many viruses, including poxviruses, have evolved strategies to block apoptosis to keep cells alive until virus replication is completed. Here, a novel viral anti-apoptotic protein from vaccinia virus and camelpox virus, viral Golgi anti-apoptotic protein (v-GAAP), and its human counterpart, h-GAAP, are described. Evolutionarily, GAAPs are extremely well conserved with closely related proteins in plants, insects, amphibia, and mammals, the viral and human counterparts sharing a striking 73% sequence identity. GAAPs are resident in the Golgi and inhibit apoptosis induced by a wide range of apoptotic stimuli. Knockout of h-GAAP, which is expressed in every tissue tested, induced cell death by apoptosis. The close relationship between the viral and the human proteins was confirmed in that v-GAAP could complement for the loss of h-GAAP and promote cell survival. Deletion of the v-GAAP gene from vaccinia virus affected virus virulence. Thus, this study identifies a new regulator of cell death that is highly conserved in evolution and has been hijacked by poxviruses. These data support a role for the Golgi complex in sensing pro-apoptotic stimuli.","Vaccinia virus, the camelpox virus, infects eukaryotic cells and causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans and animals.

We also show that deletion of the Golgi gene in vaccinia virus can affect virus replication in cell culture, and that the virus virulence in murine infection model.

Epidemics of meningitis occur almost every year in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, throughout a high-burden area spanning Senegal to Ethiopia dubbed the “Meningitis Belt.” Most epidemics in Africa are caused by Neisseria meningitidis (mostly serogroup A and W135). Mass vaccination campaigns attempt to control epidemics by administering meningococcal vaccines targeted against these serogroups, among others. However, global shortages of these vaccines are currently seen. We studied the use of fractional (1/5 and 1/10) doses of a licensed vaccine to assess its non-inferiority compared with the normal full dose. In a randomized trial in Uganda, we found that immune response and safety using a 1/5 dose were comparable to full dose for three serogroups (A, Y, W135), though not a fourth (C). In light of current shortages of meningococcal vaccines and their importance in fighting meningitis epidemics around the world, we suggest fractional doses be taken under consideration in mass vaccination campaigns.","The Neisseria meningitidis serogroup is the main causative pathogen of meningitis epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. In recent years, mass vaccination campaigns with polysaccharide vaccines have been key elements in controlling epidemics. Facing a global vaccine shortage, we explored the use of fractional doses of a licensed/C/Y/W135/Meningococcal vaccine. We conducted a randomized, non-inferiority trial in 750 healthy volunteers 2–19 years old in Mbarara, Uganda, to compare the immune response to the dose of the vaccine versus the fractional dose (1/5 and 1/10) of the serogroups W135 and W135.

This transformation is manifested by a greatly thickened and rigid (sclerotized) exoskeletal cuticle secreted by the forewing epidermis. We demonstrate that this evolutionary modification is accompanied by the incorporation of two highly abundant structural proteins into the elytral cuticle, namely TcCPR18 and TcCPR27. Depletion of these proteins by RNA interference results in malformation and weakening of the elytra, culminating in insect death. These proteins are also abundant in hard cuticle from other regions such as the pronotum and ventral abdomen, but are absent in soft cuticles, and therefore may function as key determinants of rigid cuticle. Expression of such proteins at high levels in the modified forewing appears to have been a fundamental evolutionary step in the transformation of the membranous wing into a thickened and rigid elytron in the Coleoptera.","The insect cuticle is composed primarily of chitin structural proteins. In this study, we studied the function of structural proteins present in the elytra of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. We identified two highly abundant proteins, TcCPR27 (10 kDa) and TCCPR18 (20 kDa), present in pronotum and ventral abdominal cuticles. The members of the Rebers Riddiford family of cuticular proteins contain RR2 motifs, which dramatically increase the abundance of pharate during the adult stage. Injection of specific double-stranded RNAs in the penultimate instar larvae effect larval–larval, larval-pupal, and pupal–adult molting. In contrast, the adult form of the insect is rigid, wrinkled, warped, fenestrated, and rigid. We found that the insects that fold the hindwings properly died prematurely approximately a week after eclosion, probably due to dehydration and dehydration. Immunolocalization studies confirmed the presence of the TccPR27 elytral cuticle.

The inadequacy of existing control measures for these mosquitoes has prompted research into methods for genetic control. We have genetically engineered A. gambiae mosquitoes to express, during spermatozoa development, an enzyme that selectively cuts a DNA sequence present only on a family of essential genes located on the X chromosome. We found that in heterozygous male mosquitoes, this genetic modification induced complete early dominant embryo lethality in crosses with wild-type females. All spermatozoa from these males, including those not containing the genetic modification, carried the chromosome X cutting enzyme that could attack the maternally inherited X chromosome of the embryo. Furthermore, this genetic modification introduced a strong, negative bias toward X chromosome–carrying spermatozoa. These transgenic mosquitoes fulfil a number of requirements for implementing vector control measures based on genetic sterility, but our data also demonstrate the feasibility of generating synthetic sex distorters and reveal the possibility of manipulating maternally inherited genes using wild-type sperm cells carrying enzymes designed to attack selected maternal DNA sequences.","Anopheles gambiae 28S ribosomal genes selectively target the X chromosome carrying spermatozoa.

During latency, gammaherpesviruses, such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), persist as multicopy, circularized genomes in the cell nucleus and express a small subset of viral genes. KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is the predominant gene expressed during latent infection. C-terminal LANA binds KSHV terminal repeat (TR) DNA to mediate DNA replication. TR DNA binding also allows tethering of the viral genome to mitotic chromosomes to mediate DNA segregation to daughter nuclei. We describe here the crystal structure of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 LANA DNA binding domain, which is homologous to that of KSHV LANA. The structure revealed a dimer and we identified residues involved in the interaction with viral DNA. Mutation of these residues abolished DNA binding and viable latency establishment in a mouse model of infection. We also identified a positively charged patch on the dimer surface opposite to the DNA binding region and found this patch exerts an important role in the virus's ability to expand latent infection in vivo. This work elucidates the structure of the LANA DNA binding domain and identifies a novel surface feature that is critical for viral latent infection, likely by acting through a host cell protein.","Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) mediates γ2-herpesvirus genome persistence and regulates transcription. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the murine gammaherpesviruses-68 LANA C-terminal domain at 2.2 Å resolution.

We predicted that the DNA binding surface is present opposite to the interface of the positive electrostatic patch. Targeted DNA recognition substitutions eliminated DNA binding, but certain charged patch mutations reduced bromodomain protein, BRD4, binding. Virus containing LANA abolished DNA binding and was incapable of viable latent infection in mice. Virus mutations in the charged patch periphery exhibited a substantial deficiency in expansion of latent infection, with central region substitutions having little effect. The deficiency was independent of BRD 4. Our results reveal a unique charged region that exerts a critical role in viral latent infection and likely acting as host cell protein(s)."

It is known that recognition is performed in three stages. In the first stage, the sensors respond to an odor by displaying a reproducible neuronal pattern. This code is turned, in the second and third stages, into a sparse code, that is, only relatively few neurons activate over hundreds of milliseconds. It is generally assumed that the insect brain uses this temporal code to recognize an odor. We propose a new model of how this temporal code emerges using sequential activation of groups of neurons. We show that these sequential activations underlie a fast and accurate recognition which is highly robust against neuronal or sensory noise. This model replicates several key experimental findings and explains how the insect brain achieves both speed and robustness of odor recognition as observed in experiments.","The insect brain is composed of spatiotemporal patterns of projection neurons in the antennal lobe.

In contrast, the mean differences in BMI in 42/43 y women were lowest compared to the highest social class 2.0 kg/m2 (95% CI: −0.1, 4.0) in 1946 NSHD, 2.3 kg/M2 (1.3, 3.4) in 1958 NCDS, and 3.9 kg /m2 in 1970 BCS; mean (SD) BMI was highest among the lowest social classes in both cohorts, evident in both men and women, and inequalities in BMI were larger among women from the 1970 and 1970 cohorts compared with earlier- born cohorts. These findings suggest that new effective policies to reduce inequalities in adult BMI will be urgently needed."

Lower drug price miltefosine result cost saving government perspective .","Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a tropical parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies that causes chronic skin and mucosal ulcers. Current standard of care therapy requires patients to travel to a clinic for twenty consecutive days for injections of meglumine antimoniate (MA). This may represent an economic burden, particularly for patients living far from healthcare services, especially children and their caregivers. We performed mathematical modeling to compare costs of the standard of care treatment with costs of miltefosine, an equivalently efficacious oral medication that allows pediatric patients to be treated at home under trained supervision of a caregiver. In our model, miltefosine led to substantially lower costs for patients and only slightly higher costs to the healthcare system. Importantly, the cost to society (combined patient and healthcare system costs) was lower for miltefosine compared to MA. Treatment of pediatric CL with miltefosine in the patient’s home could decrease overall cost of treatment, while diminishing the barriers and cost burden on patients, their caregivers, and society.","Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Myglumine Leishmania. Treatment with miltefosine is a non-inferior-line, injectable treatment for CL. In this study, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the cost-of-cure and government-payer perspective of miltosine in pediatric CL in southwest Colombia. We developed a Monte Carlo model to compare the cost of-cave and government payer perspectives. We estimated the healthcare utilization costs and travel obtained from surveys of providers and published sources. The primary outcome of cost-aide was reported in 2015 USD. Treatment efficacy, costs, adherence varied sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results. We found that treatment with the miltefsosine resulted substantially lower cost-Aide of cure from the societal patient perspective, and a slightly higher cost-BASE from the government payER perspective compared to treatment with miltose. The Mean societal cost--Aase was $ 531 (SD±$239) from the patient perspective and $ 188 from miltase. The mean cost-bASE was $ 343. The median cost-CASE was approximately $442 (SD ±$233) from both the patient and government perspective, with a slightly more costly difference between miltse and miltere.

Infections tend be chronic and may last for many years. Chronic STH infections are associated with modulation of the immune response, a consequence of which may be a reduced prevalence of allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma. The mechanisms by which STH infections suppress inflammatory responses are poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesized that STH infections may affect immune responses through alterations of immune homeostasis (or the steady-state adjustments of the immune system that maintain equilibrium). We investigated the capacity of blood from children classified as having no, light, or chronic STH infections to produce cytokines at rest (i.e. no immunologic stimulation) and the expression of genes in blood samples. Our data show that blood cells of children with chronic STH infections have an altered immune response that is likely to be associated with less allergic inflammation (the modified Th2 response) and that the expression of some inflammatory genes are reduced. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which STH infections suppress immune responses in children to ensure the survival of the parasite and reduce inflammation.","Chronic soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are associated with the effects of systemic immune responses caused by alterations in immune homeostasis. In this study, we measured the impact of STH infections on cytokine responses and gene expression in unstimulated blood. Children were classified into three groups: chronic, light, and uninfected. We found that chronic STH infection was associated with elevated production of GM-CSF, IL-2 (P = 0.007) and IL-5 (p  = 01), and increased IL-10 production. We also observed that chronic infections were associated with a modified Th2 immune response. These findings suggest that the altered Th2 response may contribute to the development of altered immune responses."

Both are based on a densely packed coat of a single protein, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which covers the entire extracellular surface of the cell. The first strategy is antigenic variation, through which individual cells switch the identity of the expressed VSG at a low frequency and are selected by the host immune response. If the VSG is novel, the trypanosome proliferates, maintaining the infection; if it doesn't switch, or if the new VSG is not novel, it will be killed. In the second strategy, the VSG acts as a protective barrier, shielding the cell from innate and adaptive immune factors until there is an overwhelming titre of antibodies recognising the expressed VSG. In this review, the VSG coat is modelled, and past experiments that investigated how it protected the trypanosome are revisited using current knowledge of VSG sequence and structure. The conclusions are: (i) the identity of the individual VSGs explains early experimental variation; (ii) most of the VSG molecule is accessible to antibodies. This second conclusion highlights a gap in our understanding of how the VSG coat works, as several plasma membrane proteins with large extracellular domains are very unlikely to be hidden from host antibodies by VSG.","Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that infects humans and causes severe disease in the developing world. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. The bite of the infected mosquito causes a severe infection, which can lead to death and disability. The infection is caused by a virus called Trypanosomavirus, which infects millions of people worldwide. In this study, we show that a variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat covers the external face of the mammalian bloodstream and acts as a physical barrier to protect the plasma membrane from antibodies. We show that the VSG coat is an impenetrable barrier, and that antibodies and extracellular proteins interact. In addition, we demonstrate that the presence of antibodies on the plasma surface of the trypanosome can be explained by the identity of individual VSGs."

The widely studied model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has none of the known light transduction systems, but we discovered that C. elegans has a robust locomotory response to ultraviolet light. C. elegans may use this light response to escape damaging or lethal doses of sunlight. Ultraviolet and other shortwave light, such as violet and blue wavelengths, drive locomotion by bypassing two critical signals, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and diacylglycerol (DAG), that neurons use to shape and control behaviors. C. elegans mutants lacking these signals are paralyzed and unresponsive to harsh physical stimuli in ambient light, but short-wavelength light rapidly rescues their paralysis and restores greater-than-normal levels of coordinated locomotion. This astonishing light response is mediated by a novel ultraviolet light receptor that acts in neurons. Our results reveal a novel molecular solution for ultraviolet light detection and an unusual sensory modality in C. elegans that is unlike any previously described light response in any organism.","The ability of organisms to transduce light signals is crucial for survival. Light stimulates DNA repair and metabolism in bacteria, avoidance responses in single-cell organisms, attraction responses in plants, and visual nonvisual perception in animals. Despite widely differing responses, there are known families of proteins that transducer light. In the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, one of the only known light transduction systems, C. elegans strongly accelerates locomotion in response to blue and shorter wavelengths of light, and maximal responsiveness to ultraviolet light. Here, we show that the light response is mediated by LITE-1, a novel ultraviolet light receptor that acts as a member of the invertebrate Gustatory receptor (Gr) family. Heterologous expression of this receptor in muscle cells is sufficient to confer light responsiveness in cells normally unresponsive to light.

Our brain can reconstruct the third dimension from these flat retinal images using multiple sources of visual information, or cues. The horizontal displacement of the two retinal images, known as binocular disparity, and the relative motion between different objects are two important depth cues. However, to make the most of the information provided by each cue, our brains must efficiently integrate across them. To examine this process, we used neuroimaging in monkeys to record brain responses evoked by stimuli signaling depths defined by either binocular disparity or relative motion in isolation, and also when the two cues are combined congruently or incongruently. We found that cortical area MT in monkeys is involved in the fusion of these two particular depth cues, in contrast to previous human imaging data that pinpoint a more posterior cortical area, V3B/KO. Our findings support the existence of depth cue integration mechanisms in primates; however, this fusion appears to be computed in slightly different areas in humans and monkeys.","In this study, we decoded monkey functional MRI (fMRI) responses evoked stimuli signaling near far depths defined by binocular disparity, relative motion, and combination, compared to the results of an identical experiment previously performed in humans.

Much of this response is controlled by post-translational protein phosphorylation. Although many regulators that mediate changes in protein phosphorylation are known, how these regulators inter-connect in a single regulatory network that can transmit cellular signals is not known. It is also unclear how regulators that promote growth and regulators that activate the stress response interconnect to reorganize resource allocation during stress. Here, we developed an integrated experimental and computational workflow to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes during osmotic stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The workflow integrates data measuring protein phosphorylation changes in response to osmotic stress with known physical interactions between yeast proteins from large-scale datasets, along with other information about how regulators recognize their targets. The resulting network suggested new signaling connections between regulators and pathways, including those involved in regulating growth and defense, and predicted new regulators involved in stress defense. Our work highlights the power of using network inference to deliver new insight on how cells coordinate a diverse adaptive strategy to stress.","Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi- faceted response that spans all levels of physiology. The response to stress is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phospho-proteomic changes is dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer how the signaling network regulates phosphorylated changes in response to salt stress. Our approach link predicted regulators groups that are likely to co-regulate phospho and peptides responding to stress, creating new edges in the background protein interaction network. We use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type mutant and protein-protein interaction data to predict the network controlling stress-activated and phospho proteomic changes. Our network inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-regulated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth stress. We confirmed network predictions by co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification. Our results show that cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and reduced phosphorylating factors targeted at PKA require Rck2 kinase to physically interact with PDe2. Our work shows that a high-quality computational network model can facilitate the discovery of new pathway interactions with osmotic stress."

Here, we analyzed the role of miR-202, a miRNA predominantly expressed in gonads in vertebrate. We studied its expression in the medaka ovary and knocked out the mir-202 gene to study its importance for reproductive success. We showed that the lack of miR-202 results in the sterility of both females and males. In particular, it led to a drastic reduction of both the number and the quality of eggs produced by females. Mutant females exhibited either no egg production or produced a drastically reduced number of eggs that could not be fertilized, ultimately leading to no reproductive success. Quantitative histological and molecular analyses indicated that mir-202 KO impairs oocyte development and is also associated with the dysregulation of many genes that are critical for reproduction. This study sheds new light on the regulatory mechanisms that control oogenesis, including possible targets of miR-202-5p, and provides the first in vivo functional evidence that a gonad-predominant microRNA may have a major role in female reproduction.","Female gamete production relies on coordinated molecular cellular processes that occur during ovary oogenesis.

We typically think of bacterial evolution in terms of what is gained: a bacterium might, for example, acquire an antibiotic resistance gene, or modify an existing enzyme to make better use of a nutrient source. By analyzing the fitness of bacterial populations under more than 100 different conditions, we show that in fact what they lose can be equally important: by rewiring the cell's metabolism, loss of function mutations can provide substantial fitness benefits under many challenging conditions, even cases such as exotic nutrient combinations where some new enzymatic function might seem to be required. Loss of function mutations occur at a much higher frequency than gains of specific functionality due to the larger mutational target area available. The combination of the rapid acquisition and broad functionality of loss-of-function mutations suggests that they play a major role in the early adaptation of bacterial populations to new challenges.","Bacteria grow poorly in their native ecological niche. Adaptation conditions proceed to acquire new cellular functionality and gain function mutations through modulation of cellular networks. Here, we show that under conditions of extreme nutrient limitation, substantial adaptation is achieved solely by loss function mutations, which rewire metabolism and cell gain enzymatic sensory function. We show that this adaptive loss function mutation can generate beneficial regulatory changes, but need rare, specific mutations to fine-tune network connections. This high rate of loss-of-function mutations occurs suggests that null mutations play an underappreciated role in the early stages of adaption of bacterial populations to new environments."

In this paper, we work from a theory of neocortex that models it as a spatio-temporal hierarchical system to derive a biological cortical circuit. This is achieved by combining the computational constraints provided by the inference equations for this spatio-temporal hierarchy with anatomical data. The result is a mathematically consistent biological circuit that can be mapped to the cortical laminae and matches many prominent features of the mammalian neocortex. The mathematical model can serve as a starting point for the construction of machines that work like the brain. The resultant biological circuit can be used for modeling physiological phenomena and for deriving testable predictions about the brain.","Theoretical setting of hierarchical Bayesian inference is gaining acceptance as a framework for understanding cortical computation.

The homozygous topbp1 mutants manifested decreased HSPCs during their pool expansion in the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT, an equivalent of the fetal liver in mammals) due to the p53-dependent apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that the deficient TopBP1-ATR-Chk1 pathway upon DNA replication stress in topbp1 mutants led to accumulated DNA damage and further affected HSPCs survival. These studies therefore emphasized the importance of topbp1 function as well as DNA damage response pathways during the fetal HSPC rapid proliferation.","In vertebrates, definitive hematopoiesis is a disease that occurs when the progenitor cells (HSPCs) migrate from the proliferative hematoietic microenvironment to transitory expansion.

The relative ease of aerosol preparation and high virulence makes Y. pestis a dangerous bioweapon. The current study describes the treatment of established pneumonic plague with the widely available, broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofloxacin in a nonhuman primate model. African green monkeys inhaled a target dose of 100 lethal doses for 50% of animals (LD50) and were monitored for fever and vital signs by telemetry. Fever was the first sign of illness, correlating with bacteremia but preceding radiographic pneumonia, and initiated intravenous levofloxacin treatment in doses designed to mimic antibiotic levels achieved in humans. All animals treated with saline died and all animals completing 10 days of treatment survived, with resolution of high fever within 24–48 hours. We conclude that levofloxacin may be an appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic for presumptive therapy in an aerosolized bioweapons attack and should be studied for treatment of bubonic plague.","Yersinia pestis, the agent of plague, is considered a potential bioweapon capable of causing rapid lethality delivered via aerosol inhalation.

By entering the intracellular milieu, these pathogens are protected from harsh environmental factors in the host, including the humoral and cellular immune responses. Porphyromonas gingivalis is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the oral mucosa and accesses the bloodstream and distant sites such as the blood vessel walls, brain, placenta and other organs. Still unclear is how P. gingivalis traverses from oral mucosa to these distant sites. Dendritic cells are highly migratory antigen presenting cells that “patrol” the blood, skin, mucosa and all the major organ systems. Capture of microbes by dendritic cells activates a tightly regulated series of events, including directed migration towards the secondary lymphoid organs, where processed antigens are ostensibly presented to T cells. Autophagy is now recognized as an integral component of microbial clearance, antigen processing and presentation by dendritic cells. We report here that P. gingivalis is able to subvert autophagic destruction within dendritic cells. This occurs through its glycoprotein fimbriae, called Mfa-1, which targets the C-type lectin DC-SIGN on dendritic cells. The other major fimbriae on P. gingivalis, FimA, targets TLR2, which promotes autophagic destruction of P. gingivalis. We conclude that DC-SIGN-TLR2 crosstalk determines the intracellular fate of this pathogen within dendritic cells, and may have profound implications for the treatment of many chronic diseases involving low-grade infections.","Signaling pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are expressed by professional antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and are crucial for the fate of engulfed microbes. PRRs are expressed in DCs by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectins DC-SIGN. DC-Sign is targeted by major human pathogens immune- evasion, but its role in intracellular routing of pathogens to autophagosomes is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of DC- SIGN and TLRs in evasion of autophagy and survival of Porphyromonas gingivalis in human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs). We found that Mfa-1 fimbriae deficient MoDCs were more resistant to DC-sign than Mfa1+P. gingivis strains. We also found that DC-S SIGN was dependent on the uptake of the DC-SNP ligand, FimA, which is a TLR2 agonist. These results suggest that the selective engagement of DSNP and DC-LR2 by Mf-1 and/or Mfa2 promotes evasion of antibacterial autophagophagy by lysosome fusion, resulting in the pathogen persistence in myeloid DCs."

The pheromone profile of insects is dynamic and can change depending on environmental, physiological, and social conditions. While many genes responsible for the biosynthesis of insect pheromones have been identified, much less is known about how pheromone production is systemically regulated over the lifetime of an animal. In this work, we identify 12 genes in Drosophila melanogaster that play a role in pheromone production. We characterized the function of one gene, which we name spidey, and which encodes a steroid dehydrogenase. Silencing spidey expression during the larval stage results in the rapid inactivation of an essential insect steroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone, and developmental arrest. In adults, spidey is needed for maintaining the viability of oenocytes, specialized cells that produce pheromones and also regulate energy homeostasis. Our work reveals a novel role for ecdysteroids in the adult animal and uncovers a regulatory mechanism for oenocyte activity. Potentially, ecdysteroid signaling serves as a mechanism by which environmental or social conditions shape pheromone production. Exploitation of this conserved pathway could be useful for interfering with the mating behavior and lifespan of disease-bearing insects or agricultural pests.","Cuticular lipids are found in insects that function as pheromones to communicate information about age, sex, and reproductive status. In Drosophila, the composition of the information-rich lipid profile is dynamic and changes over the lifetime of an individual. However, the molecular basis of this change is not understood. To identify genes that control cuticular lipid production in D. elegans, we performed an RNA interference screen and Direct Analysis of Real Time gas chromatography mass spectrometry to quantify changes in chemical profiles. We identified a putative gene that encodes the putative steroid dehydrogenase sex- and age-dependent effects on viability, reproductive status, and oenocyte survival. Transcriptional silencing of overexpression of spidey during embryonic development results in pupal lethality and significant changes in levels of the ecdysone metabolite 20-hydroxyecdysonic acid 20- hydroxyecdysone. In contrast, inhibiting gene expression in adulthood resulted in striking loss of cuticular hydrocarbons, desiccation resistance, and lifespan. Oenocyte loss and cuticular lipid levels were partially rescued by 20-hygienic acid supplementation. Taken together, our results identify a novel regulator of pheromerone synthesis and reveal that ecdysteroid signaling is essential for the maintenance of cuticle lipids in oenocytes in adulthood."

In a setting that resembled a video game, participants selected the most rewarding paths traversing a triangular lattice of disks of different sizes, while the lattice scrolled down a touchscreen at a constant speed. Disk sizes represented the rewards; missing a disk incurred a penalty. Every choice excluded a number of the disks accessible in the future, encouraging subjects to examine prospective paths as far into the future as they could. In contrast to previous evidence that humans tend to reduce the computational difficulty of decision making by means of simplifying heuristics, our participants appeared to perform an exhaustive computation of all possible future scenarios within a horizon limited by a fixed number of computations. Under increasing time pressure, participants either reduced the computational horizon or recalculated the expected rewards less frequently, revealing a resource-limited ability for rapid detailed computation of prospective actions. To perform such intensive computations, participants could take advantage of the massively parallel neural architecture of the visual system allowing one to concurrently process information from multiple retinal locations.","The future is an unpredictable and unpredictable world where the ability to foresee myriad consequences of actions is limited. In this study, we studied how humans select actions based on extrinsic intrinsic uncertainty. We found that humans choose actions based upon an exponentially expanding number of prospects branching from a multivalued visual stimulus. We compared human behavior in terms of the far future looked (“depth computation”) and the recalculation period (”calculation period”). We found, given the task difficulty, that humans traded depth computation for a recalculated period of time. This tradeoff was consistent with complete, brute-force exploration of possible paths of resource-limited finite depth. Our step-by-step analysis of human behavior revealed that participants took account of fine distinctions between future rewards and abstained from simple heuristics assessment of alternative paths, seeking the largest disks avoiding smaller disks. We also found that participants preferred to reduce depth computation to increase recalculation periods to sacrifice precision computation."

In this technique, a fluorescent calcium indicator changes its brightness when a neuron fires an action potential due to an associated increase in intracellular calcium. However, while a number of algorithms have been proposed for estimating spike rates from the measured signal, the problem is far from solved. We organized a public competition using a data set for which ground truth data was available. Participants were given a training set to develop new algorithms, and the performance of the algorithms was evaluated on a hidden test set.

One proposed strategy involves the use of endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis as a novel biocontrol agent to prevent RNA virus transmission in mosquitoes. Previous work in the field suggests that the presence of this bacterium induces virus resistance within the host. However, the underlying mechanism of this antiviral phenotype is poorly understood, impeding its widespread use. Using the alphavirus, Sindbis as our model, we explored the tripartite interaction between the virus and the endosymbiont within its natural host, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we show that Wolbachia negatively influences multiple important aspects of the virus life cycle, extending our current understanding of the molecular nature of this interaction. We also provide evidence highlighting the role of a host gene, Mt2, in Wolbachia–mediated antiviral resistance, while uncovering its previously unknown role as an antiviral host factor against Sindbis virus.","Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular endosymbiont that is known to confer host resistance to RNA viruses in insects. However, the causal mechanism underlying this antiviral defense remains poorly understood. To address this question, we developed a robust arthropod model system to study the tripartite interaction involving Sindbis virus and Wolbachia strain wMel in the native host, Drosophila melanogaster. Using the power of DRSophila genetics and parallel, highly tractable cell culture system, we determined that in addition to reducing infectious virus production and particle infectivity in infected flies, Wolbachiosis negatively influences Sindbis viral particle and infectivity, accompanied by reductions in viral transcript and protein levels. Interestingly, the unchanged ratio of viral RNA copies to viral transcripts suggests that Wolbachias likely influence translational efficiency of viral transcripts. Additionally, expression analyses of candidate host genes revealed that the D. melanogast methyltransferase gene Mt2 was induced by the host factor in the presence of the virus. These findings provide evidence supporting the role of Wolbachiae–modulated host factors in RNA virus resistance in arthropods, alongside establishing Mt2 as a novel antiviral function for Sindbis and D. spp."

Hair cells are susceptible to injury by noise, toxins, and other insults. In mammals, hair cells cannot be regenerated after injury, resulting in permanent hearing loss. Understanding genetic pathways that regulate hair cell development in the mammalian organ of Corti will help in developing methods to regenerate hair cells to treat hearing loss. Many genes are essential for hair cell and supporting cell development in the mouse organ of Corti. Among these are Sox2, Fgfr1, and Fgf20. Here, we investigate the relationship between these three genes to further define their roles in development. Interestingly, we found that Sox2 and Fgf20 interact to affect hair cell and supporting cell development in a spatially-graded manner. We found that cells toward the outer compartment and the base of the cochlea are more strongly affected by the loss of Sox2 and Fgf20. We provide evidence that this spatially-graded effect can be partially explained by the roles of the two genes in the precise timing of two sequential stages of organ of Corti development, specification and differentiation.","The mouse organ Corti, housed inside the cochlea, contains hair cells supporting cells that transduce sound and electrical signals. These cells develop two main steps: progenitor specification followed by differentiation. Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling is an important developmental pathway, but the deletion of the FGF receptor 1 (Fgfr1) ligand, Fgf20, leads to loss of hair cells and supporting cells in the organ of Corti. Here, we show that FGF20-FGFR1 signaling is required for specification and differentiation, and that it interacts with the transcription factor Sox2, which is important for hair cell supporting cell development, a topic of debate. Furthermore, we provide evidence that decreased Sox2 expression delays specification, begins near the apex of cochlear base, and progresses to the apex. These findings reveal an intricate developmental program regulating the organ and Corti development, especially in the basal-apical axis of the organ."

However, a decades-long control campaign drastically reduced the number of infested houses, and the city is now in a stage where health personnel annually inspect a sample of houses throughout the city for kissing bug reinfestation. A large amount of information was collected during the control campaign that could be used to help identify the houses at highest risk for re-infestation, so we developed a cell phone app to provide this information to health personnel in the form of interactive, user-friendly risk maps. We carried out a pilot study to see if health personnel would use these maps to select houses to inspect for re-infestation, and we found that most inspectors did use the information. We also observed that using the app did not slow the inspectors down, which can be an issue when introducing new technology. Our results suggest that the app could be a useful tool for monitoring diseases spread by insects in cities.","The Chagas disease vector, Triatoma infestans, is widespread in Arequipa, Perú, Peru.

To monitor T. infestan resurgence, the city is currently conducting a surveillance phase to sample houses selected for inspection during the inspection year. Despite extensive data control campaign to inform surveillance, selection of houses to inspect is carried out haphazardly and at the convenience of the city. Therefore, we asked, what can be done to enhance efforts to prevent T.infestans resurgence by creating an opportunity for vector surveillance informed by data?To this end, we developed a mobile app that provides vector infestation risk maps generated by the data-control campaign and run a predictive model. The app is intended to enhance vector surveillance activities by giving inspectors an opportunity to incorporate infestation and risk information into surveillance activities, and dictate houses to surveil."

Their number varies from a few hundred in yeast cells to several thousands in human cells, distributed along the genome at comparable distances in both systems. An important question in the field is to understand how origins of replication are specified and regulated in the mammalian genome, as neither their location nor their activity can be directly inferred from the DNA sequence. Previous studies at individual origins and, more recently, at large scale across 1% of the human genome, have revealed that most origins overlap with transcriptional regulatory elements, and specifically with gene promoters. To gain insight into the nature of the relationship between active transcription and origin specification we have combined a genomic mapping of origins at 0.4% of the mouse genome with detailed studies of activation efficiency. The data identify two types of origins with distinct regulatory properties: highly efficient origins map at CpG island-promoters and low efficient origins locate elsewhere in association with transcriptional units. We also find a remarkable parallel organisation of the replication initiation sites and transcription start sites at efficient promoter-origins that suggests a prominent role of transcription initiation in setting the efficiency of replication origin activation.","Genomic mapping of DNA replication origins (ORIs) in mammals provides a powerful means of understanding the regulatory complexity of the genome. We combine a genome-wide approach to identify preferential sites for DNA replication initiation in 0.4% of the mouse genome and detailed molecular analysis of distinct classes of ORIs according to their location relative to their relative genes. Our study reveals that 85% of replication initiation sites in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are associated with transcriptional units. Nearly half of the ORIs map promoter regions, and interestingly, ORI density strongly correlates with promoter density, reflecting coordinated organisation of replication transcription in the mouse mouse genome. Detailed analysis of ORI activity showed that CpG island promoter-ORIs are more efficient than ORIs in ES cells and that ORI specification and firing efficiency are maintained in all cell types. Remarkably, the distribution of transcription initiation sites at promoter- ORIs exactly parallels those at transcription start sites (TSS) and TSS, suggesting co-evolution of regulatory regions driving replication transcription. This association implies that transcription initiation in early development sets the probability for ORI activation, unveiling a new hallmark in ORI efficiency regulation in mammalian cells."

While kin recognition is important in animals, microbes often use kind recognition, in which cells are genetically related only at certain loci—so-called “greenbeard” genes. Genomic and genetic analyses of a wild population of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa showed that greenbeard genes mediate long-distance kind discrimination that regulates communication and chemotropic interactions of cells prior to somatic cell fusion; N. crassa cells actively search for fusion partners with similar greenbeard genes. Kind discrimination was regulated by a set of highly divergent paralogous genes (doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3) that were necessary and sufficient to confer communication identity. Alleles that confer the interaction phenotype at the doc loci have been maintained through multiple speciation events, suggesting that selection is acting to maintain different communication groups in fungi.","Microorganisms are capable of communication cooperation to perform social activities. Cooperation is enforced by kind discrimination mechanisms that individuals preferentially help punish, depending on the genetic relatedness of certain loci. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, genetically identical asexual spores (germlings) communicate in a highly regulated process, associated with fitness benefits and colony establishment. Recognition of chemotropic interactions between isogenic germlings requires oscillation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction protein complex (NRC-1, MEK-2, MAK-3, scaffold protein HAM-5) and specialized cell fusion structures termed conidial anastomosis tubes. In a population of 110 wild N. crassas isolates, we investigated germling fusion in genetically unrelated individuals.

Alleles of the doc-1 haplotypes showed transspecies polymorphism. Swapping of the Doc-1/doc-2 alleles from different communication group strains was necessary sufficient to confer communication group affiliation. We also found that DOC-1 oscillated MAK/2 tips in conidials anastomyosis tubes, while DOC-2 was statically localized in the plasma membrane. These data indicate that doc-3 and Doc-3 function as “greenbeard” genes, involved in mediating long-distance kind recognition. These findings suggest that cooperation involves actively searching for type, resulting in cooperation with non-genalogical relatives."

Hyperlongevity strong age-1(mg44 ) mutants result inability reset molecular switch reproductive mode .","Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) impacts development, metabolism, and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. It has been viewed as a cascade of kinase reactions, chiefly phosphorylation of other kinases, leading to inactivation of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. PI3K, a phosphatidylinositol kinase at the center of this pathway, converts PIP2 to PIP3, instrumental to kinase docking and activation. Here we show that PI3K deficiency elicits transcriptional inhibition of many kinases, including those of IIS itself. This creates a positive-feedback loop, wherein DAF-16/FOXO silences expression of the very kinases that would have inactivated it. In the resulting “flip-flop” genetic switch, either kinase signaling or transcriptional silencing may predominate. We discovered the transcriptional arm of this switch in infertile age-1(mg44) mutants, defective for PI3K activity. The absence of PIP3 and PIP3-dependent kinase activity gives free rein to gene silencing by DAF-16/FOXO. This two-tiered response could scarcely have evolved for the benefit of a sterile mutant; some components presumably serve regulatory functions in normal animals, reinforcing a switch responsive to environmental and internal signals. In age-1(mg44) mutants, complete inactivation of PI3K “fuses” the switch, locking worms into longevity mode. With signaling profoundly silenced, they cannot resume reproduction, but instead acquire a remarkable capacity for individual survival.","Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) regulates the development of metabolism, modulates aging, and regulates aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. In nematodes, mammals, and plants, IIS is understood to operate via a kinase-phosphorylation cascade that inactivates the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. In this study, we show that the nematode phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates PIP2 to form PIP3, a phospholipid required for membrane tethering and activation of signaling molecules. We show that inactivation of PI3 K disrupts PIP1-dependent kinase signaling, and that this attenuation results in a 10-fold greater longevity in second-generation (F2) homozygotes, comparable to gains in stress resistance in wild-type adults. The age-1(mg44) nonsense mutation results in reduced expression of multiple transcripts, which distinguish mutant F1 and F2-mutants from the weaker F1 mutant, and suggests that this mutation may be a consequence of an inability to reset the molecular switch to reproductive mode."

Chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option for leishmaniasis. First-line therapies include pentavalent antimonials, except in some regions in the Indian subcontinent, the liposomal formulation of amphotericin B, miltefosine and paromomycin. The WHO has recently recommended a combined therapy in order to extend the life expectancy of these compounds. However, resistance could be induced in Leishmania if this approach is not applied in a controlled and regulated way, thus resulting in a rapid loss of efficacy of not one but two therapeutic options. In light of this, we have designed relevant experimental studies in order to determine whether Leishmania parasites are able to develop resistance to the different potential anti-leishmanial drug combinations that will be used in the near future. The results obtained could help us to predict the success of drug combination therapy. Experimental resistance of Leishmania donovani promastigotes to drug combinations was obtained after 10 weeks and remained in the intracellular amastigotes. We therefore conclude that L. donovani can easily develop resistance to drug combinations mainly miltefosine/paromomycin and SbIII/paromomycin. These results have been validated in intracellular amastigotes and are of considerable interest for future prediction of the success of drug combination therapy.","Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito. The treatment of the disease involves the use of a variety of drugs, including amphotericin B/miltefosine, amphotericine B/paromomycin, miltefolosine/proteins, and amphotericins B/sbIII. In this study, we investigated the ability of the Leishmani parasites to develop resistance to different drug combinations. We found that the resistance to the different drugs was stable in the intracellular amastigotes. Moreover, the resistance was unstable in the resistant lines. These results are important for ensuring the long-term efficacy of drug combinations against the parasite."

Senescence, which is triggered by the loss of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes (telomeres), is often seen as an example of a regular “biological clock.” However, cell senescence is heterogeneous, with large differences in lifespan between individual cell lineages. This heterogeneity is clearly related to stress, specifically oxidative stress. It was not known, however, whether stress-induced “premature” senescence involves telomeres or is caused by telomere-independent DNA damage responses. Mitochondria are the most important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells under physiological conditions. We found that mitochondrial function deteriorated while cells approached senescence, leading to increased ROS production. Delaying mitochondrial dysfunction led to postponed replicative senescence and slowing of telomere shortening. Prematurely senescing cells sorted out of young cultures displayed mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and short telomeres. We propose that replicative telomere-dependent senescence is not “clocked,” but rather is a stochastic process triggered largely by random mitochondrial dysfunction.","Aging is an inherently stochastic process, characterized by heterogeneity in organisms, cell types, clonal populations, and identical environments. The replicative lifespan of primary human cells is telomere dependent; however, the heterogeneity is poorly understood. We show that mitochondrial superoxide production increases the replicative age of human fibroblasts despite adaptive UCP-2–dependent mitochondrial uncoupling. This mitochondrial dysfunction is accompanied by compromised [Ca2+]i homeostasis indicators and retrograde response in senescent cells. Replicative senescence in human fibrosomes is delayed by mild mitochondrial uncupling. Uncoupling reduces mitochondrial superoxy generation, slows telomeres shortening, and delays the formation of telomeric γ-H2A.X foci. Our results suggest that mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a major determinant of telomerenescence."

In addition, many cancers have an inflammatory microenvironment that promotes tumor growth. Here, we show that inflammatory infiltration synergizes with tissue regeneration to induce DNA sequence rearrangements in vivo. Chronically inflamed issues that are continuously regenerating are thus at an increased risk for mutagenesis and malignant transformation. Further, rapidly dividing tumor cells in an inflammatory microenvironment can also acquire mutations, which have been shown to contribute to drug resistance and disease recurrence. Finally, inflammation-induced tissue regeneration sensitizes tissues to DNA damaging environmental exposures and chemotherapeutics. The work described here thus increases our understanding of how inflammation leads to genetic changes that drive cancer formation and recurrence.","Mutations are critical drivers of cancer initiation and cancer recurrence. While extensive studies have focused on exposure-induced mutations, studies have explored the importance of tissue physiology as a modulator of mutation susceptibility in vivo. In particular, inflammation, a known cancer risk factor, is relevant for chronic inflammatory diseases and pathogen-induced inflammation. In this study, fluorescent yellow direct repeat (FYDR) mice harbor a reporter to detect misalignments in homologous recombination (HR), an important class of mutations. In FYDR mice exposed to cerulein, a potent inducer of pancreatic inflammation, inflammation induces DSBs (γH2AX foci) that days later increase cell proliferation. In isolated bouts of inflammation induce HR, overlap between inflammation-induced DNA damage and inflammation- induced cell proliferation induced HR significantly. In addition, in animals exposed to methylnitrosourea, a model alkylating agent that creates DNA lesions relevant to environmental exposures to cancer chemotherapy, we found that exposure to alkylation damage induces HR, but importantly, inflammation-mediated cell proliferation and inflammation induced HR are synergistic in a synergistic fashion. Taken together, our results demonstrate that acute bout of inflammation, which is a kinetic barrier separating DNA damage from cell proliferation, protects mutations from exposure to inflammation."

From the 96 variants, only one variant G2 in the APOL1 gene was found to be strongly associated with protection from trypanosomiasis. The results reported here will contribute to the knowledge of the role of human genetics in disease progression, which could offer opportunities for development of much needed new diagnostics and intervention strategies.","Trypanosoma brucei (T.b. rhodesiense) is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in eastern and southern African countries. There is evidence of diversity in the disease progression and progression of the disease in different countries. HAT in Malawi is associated with chronic haemo-lymphatic stage infection compared to countries, Uganda, which are associated with acute and marked neurological impairment. This study raises the question of the role of host genetic factors in infection outcomes. We conducted a candidate gene association study involving 202 subjects, 70 cases and 132 controls in the northern region of Malawi.

It plays an essential role in various aspects of biology, including the development and progression of many diseases. As the metabolism of a living cell involves several thousands of small molecules and their conversion, a full analysis of such a metabolic network is only feasible using computational approaches. In addition, metabolism differs significantly from cell to cell and over different contexts. Therefore, the efficient generation of context-specific mathematical models is of high interest. We present fastcore, a fast algorithm for the reconstruction of compact context-specific metabolic network models. The algorithm takes as input a global metabolic model and a set of reactions that are known to be active in a given context, and it produces a context-specific model. fastcore is significantly faster than other algorithms, typically obtaining a genome-wide reconstruction in a few seconds. High-throughput model building will soon become a common procedure for the integration and analysis of omics data, and we foresee many future applications of fastcore in disease and patient specific metabolic modeling.","Metabolic network reconstruction is an important step in the study of biological cell tissue.

Here we show that peripheral blood samples from multiple studies can be described by nine common axes of variation that collectively explain up to one half of all transcriptional variance in blood. Specific axes diverge according to environmental variables such as lifestyle and infectious disease exposure, but a strong genetic component to axis regulation is also inferred. As few as 10 “blood-informative transcripts” (BITs) can be used to define each axis and potentially classify individuals with respect to multiple aspects of their blood and immune function. The analysis of longitudinal profiles of one individual shows how these change relative to clinical shifts in metabolic profile following viral infection. The notion that gene expression diverges along genetic paths of least resistance defined by these axes has important implications for interpreting differential expression in case-control studies of disease.","In the context of personalized medicine, a novel approach to capturing the covariance structure of peripheral blood gene expression relies on the identification of highly conserved Axes. In this study, we used a new dataset of 189 healthy adult participants from the Emory-Georgia Tech Center for Health Discovery- (CHDWB) cohort, to identify Axes 99.028 and 1,028 strongly co-regulated transcripts. We found that Axes are strongly conserved across several sub-classes of blood immune function, including T-cell and B-cell physiology and innate, adaptive, and anti-viral responses. Conservation of Axes demonstrated additional population-based gene expression profiling studies, and robustly associated with Body Mass Index in CHDWB Finnish and Australian cohorts. Furthermore, tightly co-regulated genes define Axis “Blood Informative Transcripts” (BITs), generating scores that define individual respect represented by immune activity and blood physiology. We also found that environmental factors, including lifestyle differences between Morocco and Morocco leading to active latent tuberculosis, significantly impact specific axes, and significant heritability of Axis scores. Our findings suggest that the differential expression of genes marking class disease may reflect the movement of major normal Axes in response to environmental genetic stimuli."

As a case study, we focus on ecological metapopulations, which may be viewed as a set of distinct subpopulations (/sites) that are connected via a dispersal network of arbitrary complexity. Metapopulation persistence is found to depend critically on the topology of cycles, and cyclical components in the connectivity network, because they allow the offspring of the population to eventually “return home” to the sites from which they originated. The methodology identifies critical migration routes, whose presence are vital to overall stability, and are thus of high conservation priority – information that may be of value when designing networks of marine protected areas. In contrast, links that do not participate in a cyclical component have no impact on persistence and thus have low conservation priority. While network theory is highly fashionable in biology, only few studies go deeper than descriptive statistical applications as attempted here. Moreover, the key results are easily extended to other biological contexts (e.g., disease networks), particularly in situations whereby the network controls the dynamics of a complex system.","Synthesising relationships between complexity, connectivity, and stability in large biological systems has been a longstanding fundamental quest in theoretical biology and ecology.

During these initial stages of development there is little or no transcription of the zygotic genome, and maternally deposited products control this process. Among the essential maternal products are mRNAs that encode transcription factors required for preparing the zygotic genome for transcriptional activation. This ensures that there is a precisely coordinated hand-off from maternal to zygotic control. In Drosophila melanogaster, the transcription factor Zelda is essential for activating the zygotic genome and coupling this activation to the degradation of the maternally deposited products. Nonetheless, the mechanism by which Zelda functions remains unclear. Here we used Cas9-mediated genome engineering to determine the functional requirements for highly conserved domains within Zelda. We identified a domain required specifically for Zelda’s role in reprogramming the early embryonic genome, but not essential for its functions later in development. Surprisingly, this domain restricts the ability of Zelda to activate transcription. These data demonstrate that Zelda activity is tightly regulated, and we propose that precise regulation of both the timing and levels of genome activation is required for the embryo to successfully transition from maternal to zygotic control.","The zygotic genome is tightly regulated by maternally deposited mRNAs. In Drosophila melanogaster, the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is tightly coordinated with degradation of maternarily provided mRNAAs. The zygotes are required for the development of the zygote genome, and the mechanisms of MZT are poorly understood. Here, we show that a conserved zinc-finger domain is essential for Zygotic activity. We also show that Z-terminal zinc finger domain is required for ZZT, and that it is conserved throughout the embryonic genome. These results suggest that ZZ-terminals are essential for the ZZN-dependent activity of Zelda. In contrast, we have previously identified a highly conserved protein domain that is not essential for Zelda-dependent gene expression. We propose that tightly regulated gene expression is essential to navigate MZTs failure and to precisely execute the developmental program that leads to embryonic lethality."

Candida albicans is a leading cause of systemic fungal infections, with mortality rates approaching 40%. One of the key virulence traits of this fungus is its ability to transition between yeast and filamentous forms in response to diverse host-relevant cues. The model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also capable of filamentous growth in certain conditions, and previous work has identified a key transcriptional complex required for filamentation in both species. However, here we discover that the circuitry governed by this complex in C. albicans is largely distinct from that in the non-pathogenic S. cerevisiae. We also employ a novel selection strategy to perform experimental evolution, identifying chromosome triplication as a mechanism to restore filamentation in a non-filamentous mutant. This work reveals unique circuitry governing a key virulence trait in a leading fungal pathogen, identifying potential therapeutic targets to combat these life-threatening infections.","Morphogenetic transitions are prevalent in the fungal kingdom. The leading human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, has the capacity to transition yeast filaments into key virulence factors. In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, filamentation enables nutrient acquisition and nutrient acquisition. In this study, we identified the Mfg1 regulator of morphogenesis, which acts as a complex with Flo8 and Mss11 to mediate transcriptional responses crucial for filamentation. However, the mechanisms that regulate morphogenesis remained elusive. Here, we explored the consequences of perturbation of Mfg2, Flo8, and MSS11 in C. albica morphogenesis and identified functional divergence between the complex members.

The conventional wisdom is that in bacteria such as E. coli, initiation occurs when sufficient active form of the initiator protein accumulates. The same scenario possibly applies to V. cholerae Chr1, whose replication in turn determines the timing of replication of its second chromosome, Chr2. This is because Chr2 replication initiation depends on the replication of a site, crtS, in Chr1. Here we show that the crtS site has significant activity towards triggering Chr2 replication without itself being replicated. We propose that the doubling of crtS copy number, normally afforded by replication, allows accumulation of enough active Chr2-specific initiator to trigger initiation. The study provides a novel example of how the timing of a gene function can be controlled by the timing of its duplication.","Chromosome replication is a critical step in the cell cycle. Chromosomes harbor multiple chromosomes, which are required for the replication of different chromosomes. In Vibrio cholerae, the smaller chromosomes, Chr2, initiates replication of the Chr1 chromosomes and terminate replication synchronously. However, the mechanism by which the replication site, crtS, allows Chr2 replication remains unclear. Here, we show that the crts activity promotes the activity of a double copy number site that is required for replication of Chr2. CrtS activity promotes Chr2-specific initiator function and activity required for cell cycle regulation.

ARG activity main marker disease severity .","Over the past decades, there has been a significant improvement in the understanding of immune responses against infection with pathogenic Leishmania spp. and the pathogenesis of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in the mouse models. Leishmania parasites infect macrophages that can be activated via two major pathways resulting in classical and alternative activated macrophages which metabolize L-arginine differentially. Classically activated macrophages upregulate the enzyme inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and alternatively activated macrophages upregulate the arginase (ARG). ARG hydrolyzes the conversion of its substrate (L-arginine) to L-ornithine and urea. L-ornithine is a key intermediate substrate for the biosynthesis of polyamines, which are crucial nutrients for cellular processes such as growth, differentiation and proliferation of host cells and Leishmania parasites. Leishmania parasites may partly activate ARGs and inactivate the NO production by the host cells and enhance parasite survival via depletion of the iNOS substrate (L-arginine) and reduce NO levels. In this study, we tested the activity of this enzyme in the promastigote forms of the pathogenic L. major and L. tropica, and non-pathogenic L. tarentolae in vitro and assessed the differences between the levels of ARG activity in THP1 cells infected with different Leishmania spp. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between excessive ARG activity and lesion development in susceptible BALB/c and resistant C57BL/6 mice infected with virulent L. major, L. tropica and non-virulent L. tarentolae parasites and its impact on parasite burden during the development of infection. Our results show that ARG is highly upregulated in all pathogenic promastigotes as compared to non-pathogenic L. tarentolae and had a negative correlation between production of ARG and NO. We showed that during the development of the infection in susceptible BALB/c and resistant C57BL/6 mice, ARG is induced in both strains of mice infected with pathogenic Leishmania but not in non-pathogenic counterparts. These results suggest that ARG activity of Leishmania is essential for parasite survival in vitro and in vivo that directly regulates its growth and replication inside the host cells; therefore, it can be used as a significant marker of disease severity in CL and possible tools for drug designing.","Proliferation of Leishmania (L.) parasites depends on polyamine availability, generated by L-arginine catabolism and enzymatic activity of arginase (ARG) in parasites in mammalian hosts. In this study, we characterized the ARG activity of pathogenic L. major, L. tropica and non-pathogenic Le. tarentolae. We quantified the level of ARG activities in promastigotes and macrophages infected with pathogenic Leishmania major and L.tropica. ARG amino acid sequences from pathogenic and non -pathogenic leishmania parasites demonstrated virtually 98.6% and 88% identities of reference to L.major Friedlin ARG. Higher ARG levels were observed in pathogenic promastsigotes compared to those infected with non-endemic Leishmannia. In vitro infection with human macrophage cell line (THP1) and pathogenic non-Pathogenic LeISHmania spp. resulted in increased ARG and parasite load in infected mice. These data suggest that infection with leishmaniasis parasites increases ARG in the host and provides essential polyamines for parasite salvage and replication."

Translating these instructions allows us to better understand the connection between these mutations and disease. RNA-binding proteins (RBP) perform this translation by recognizing particular “phrases” that occupy short regions of the transcript. Recognition occurs by the binding of the RBP to the phrase. The set of phrases bound by a particular RBP is defined by the RNA base content of the binding site as well as the 3D configuration of these bases. Because it is impossible to assess RBP binding to every possible phrase, we have developed a mathematical model called RNAcontext that can be trained by measuring RBP binding strength on one set of phrases. Once trained, this model can then be used to accurately predict binding strength to any possible phrase. Compared to previously described methods, RNAcontext learns a more precise description of the 3D shapes of binding sites. This precision translates into more accurate generalization of RBP binding preferences to new phrases and allows us to make new discoveries about the binding preferences of well-studied RBPs.","Metazoan genomes encode hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). These proteins regulate post-transcriptional gene expression and play critical roles in numerous cellular processes including mRNA splicing, export, and stability of translation. Despite their ubiquity and importance, binding preferences of RBPs are not well characterized. In vitro and in vivo studies, affinity selection-based approaches have successfully identified RNA sequence associated with specific RBPs; however, it is difficult to infer RBP sequence structural preferences using specifically designed motif finding methods. In this study, we introduce a new motif-finding method, RNAcontext, designed to elucidate RBP-specific sequence structural and structural preferences with greater accuracy than existing approaches. We evaluated RNAcontext recently published in vitro and vivo RNA affinity selected data and demonstrate that RNAcontext identifies known binding preferences for control proteins including HuR, PTB, Vts1p, and predicts new RNA structure preferences for SF2/ASF, RBM4, FUSIP1, and SLM2. Our predicted binding preferences are consistent with recently reported in vivo binding sites. RNAcontext is an accurate and efficient motif finding method that is ideally suited for large-scale RNA- binding affinity datasets to determine relative binding preferences to RBPs across a wide range of RNA sequences structures."

Cell entry of a virus is the first step of every virus infection and represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention. We and others had shown that LCMV and LASV attach to a cellular receptor, α-dystroglycan, followed by internalization by endocytosis via a novel and unusual pathway. Here we investigated the largely unknown molecular mechanisms of cell entry of LASV and LCMV with the goal to identify host cell factors involved. We discovered that during cell entry LASV and LCMV pass through a particular intracellular compartment, the multivesicular body (MVB)/late endosome, which is implicated in the internalization and degradation of cellular membrane receptors. Productive infection of LASV and LCMV critically depended on cellular factors involved in the membrane dynamics and sorting processes in the MVB. Based on our studies, we propose a model for Old World arenavirus entry in which the viruses hijack a pathway that may be linked to the cellular trafficking and degradation of their cellular receptor.","Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a prototypic arenavirus that infects the host cell through an unusual endocytotic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolin, dynamin, actin, and actin. During internalization, viruses are delivered to acidified endosomes in a Rab5-independent manner bypassing classical routes of incoming vesicular trafficking. Cell entry of LASV and LCMV is required for microtubular transport into the late endosome, consistent with low fusion pH of viral envelope glycoproteins. Productive infection of recombinant LCMVs expressing the Lassa virus envelope-glycoprotein (lASV-LASVGP) with LASSV depended on phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) as an unusual phospholipid involved in the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILV) and multivesicular body (MVB) in the late ofosome. Our study provides evidence that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) of the ILV and MVB during cell entry, in particular ESCRT components Hrs, Tsg101, Vps22, and Vps24, and the ESCRT-associated ATPase Vps4, is involved in fission of ILV. Our data suggest that virus-receptor complexes undergo sorting in the MVB/MvB mediated by ESCRT, possibly a pathway linked to cellular trafficking and degradation of the cellular receptor."

Components of this ‘quorum sensing’ signalling cascade are known but their interactions and ordering are not. Here we have dissected the dependency relationships between molecules in the pathway by combinatorial gene knockout and ectopic expression, as well as by detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of one component. Our results provide a first analysis of the signal pathway architecture, revealing that it is non-linear. Moreover, phosphoproteome analysis reveals pathway hierarchy through identifying that the phosphorylation of a NEK kinase component of the pathway is reduced when a predicted upstream kinase is absent. This provides a framework for the coherent dissection of a signal transduction cascade in these parasites that use quorum sensing to control disease spread.","Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, is transmitted by tsetse flies. This process involves the generation of cell-cycle arrested, quiescent, stumpy forms of proliferative slender forms. The signalling pathway responsible for this quorum sensing response is catalogued in a genome-wide selective screen, providing a compendium of signalling protein kinases, phosphatases, RNA binding proteins and hypothetical proteins. However, the ordering of these components is unknown. We exploited a combinatorial gene knockout overexpression strategy to assess whether the loss of developmental competence of null mutants of the pathway components compensated for ectopic expression of the components. We created null mutants and evaluated complementation of expression of RBP7, NEK17, PP1-6, and inducible gene silencing by the proposed differentiation inhibitor TbTOR4. Phosphoproteomic analysis focused on the pathway component, putative MEKK, and identified molecules that altered the expression of phosphorylation profiles of MEKK1 and null mutants, including the component pathway.

The increasing number of protein–protein complexes with atomic data should help us to understand the major factors that guide protein interactions. In particular, a number of examples are available of similar proteins that interact with proteins that are very different in terms of structure and function. An intuitive hypothesis to explain the ability of these different proteins to recognize the same partner is that they display the same local region for interaction, in other words, they imitate the same binding site. Here, we quantify the similarity between these putatively mimicking binding sites. We show that it is not statistically significant. We confirm this observation on the small sets of evolutionarily conserved residues. Our results suggest that different proteins that bind the same protein do not imitate binding sites, but probably target specific locations or residues at the binding site.","Understanding the mechanisms of protein–protein interaction is a fundamental problem for practical applications. The fact that different proteins bind to similar partners suggests that convergently evolved binding interfaces can be reused from different complexes. In this study, we used a set of protein complexes composed of non-homologous domains interacting with their homologous partners at equivalent binding sites collected from 2006, offering an opportunity to investigate this point. We analyzed the physico-chemical similarity of the atomic residues at the interface level of the protein complexes. We found that the number of interfacial atoms with similar properties systematically lower than non-hologous proteins. We also assessed the significance of similarity bootstrapping and atomic properties of the interfaces.

Conventional diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease is based on microscopy at birth and serology at 9 months. However microscopy misses many infections and many at-risk infants fail to complete serology at six to nine months. We have developed a Chagas urine nanoparticle test (Chunap) for concentration and detection of T. cruzi antigens. Chunap was evaluated in urine samples of 1-month old children. At this age children have the highest levels of parasitemia and therefore also excrete the highest levels of antigen. Parents prefer a urine test to having their baby's blood drawn. Chunap diagnosed congenital infection in a single urine sample as well as PCR in two blood samples. This study also shows that hydrogel/trypan blue particles used in our test efficiently capture, concentrate and protect urinary T. cruzi antigens from enzymatic degradation. Chunap allows for the early diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease, and with appropriate adaptation, may allow early point-of-care intervention.","Congenital Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium T. cruzi. The disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito and is transmitted to the lungs by the bites of infected infants. Current programs to detect congenital chagas in Latin America utilize microscopy and early life serology at 6 months. However, these programs suffer low sensitivity and high loss of follow-up in infancy. We developed a ChagAS urine nanoparticle test (Chagap) to concentrate, preserve, and detect T.cruzi antigens in urine early, and non-invasive diagnosis of congenital disease. We demonstrate that Chagap is a simple and sensitive test for the early diagnosis and early detection of congenitally infected infants in the urine. We also demonstrate that chagap sensitivity is 96.5% (71/74 endemic, 12/12 non-endemic specimens). This is comparable to PCR specimens at 0 1 month (91.3%) and significantly higher microscopy specimens at 16.42%–57.26%.

This goal is important for a comprehensive picture of the evolutionary process, because it allows us to understand the mode of natural selection on fitness traits and identify the molecular and physiological processes that affect fitness traits. Here, we describe our work to identify the molecular genetic and physiological basis for natural variation in a core life history trait, fecundity, of Drosophila melanogaster. Using a variety of mapping techniques, we show that differential expression of the aquaporin Drip in nervous tissue affects natural variation in female fecundity. We further go on to describe a novel domain of expression of Drip in neurons that produce the insect stress hormone corazonin and demonstrate that differential expression of Drip in these neurons affects female fecundity putatively through modulating the concentration of corazonin and dopamine. This surprising and novel observation highlights the benefit of exploiting natural genetic variation to identify the molecular processes underlying phenotypic traits.","Female Drosophila melanogaster flies are heritable largely independent of measured life history traits. To gain insight into the molecular genetic basis of standing variation in fitness related traits, we mapped a portion of variation in female fecundity in flies derived from a wild orchard population. We mapped the portion of the variation in a single QTL using deficiency mapping to refine the QTL 5 candidate genes. Ubiquitous expression of RNAi genes, aquaporin encoded by Drip, is positively correlated with fecundities. We localize Drip expression to a small population of corazonin producing neurons located in the dorsolateral posterior compartments of the protocerebrum. Expression of Drip–RNAi pan- neuronal ELAV-Gal4 and Crz-GAL4 drivers reduces fecundness. Low-fitnessity RILs decreased Crz expression and increased expression of pale, an enzyme encoding the rate-limiting step of dopamine, a modulator of insect life histories. Taken together, our data suggest that natural variation in Drip gene expression in corazonins producing neurons contributes to standing variation of fitness by altering concentration of neurohormones."

The constant selection pressure from this predation promotes the evolution and dissemination of bacterial bacteriophage-resistance mechanisms. One family of protective systems causes the infected cell to undergo premature suicide, in an altruistic move that protects the clonal population of bacteria by blocking virus replication. We identified a means by which a bacteriophage counter-evolved to avoid one such system. This system relies on two components: a toxic part to kill the cell and an antidote that holds the toxin in check until required. The bacteriophage evolved sequences encoding mimics of the cellular antidote and expressed these mimics so that it could continue replicating without becoming a victim of the host's defensive system. Furthermore, this evolved bacteriophage was able to transfer the DNA encoding the defence system to a new bacterial host. In so doing, the evolved bacteriophage may have indirectly created populations of host cells inside which it could productively replicate, while also providing the host better protection from competing predators.","Abortive infection, when an infected bacterial cell commits an altruistic suicide to destroy the replicating bacteriophage and protect the clonal population, is mediated by toxin-toxin systems. In the flagellum-dependent bacterium Myoviridae, ΦTE, evolved from rare mutants that “escape” from ToxIN-mediated abortive infection with Pectobacterium atrosepticum. Wild-type Φ TE encoded a short sequence similar to the repetitive nucleotide sequence of RNA antitoxin, ToxI, and Toxin. ΦE escape mutants expanded the number of “ pseudo-ToxI” genetic repeats, and in this case, escape phages “ hijacked” the toxIN locus, allowing them to replicate in the plasmid-borne toxIN. Expression of pseudo-toxI repeats during ΦET infection allowed phage to replicate, unaffected by ToxIS, RNA–based molecular mimicry. This example of non-coding RNA encoded by phage evolves selective expansion of recombination to enable viral suppression and a defensive bacterial suicide system."

Microscopic imaging has shown how viral proteins and virus particles move within and between cells, accumulating at sites of cell-cell contact. While we suspect that these images represent virus infection, it has been difficult to accurately quantify virus replication and provirus formation in most cell-to-cell infection experiments. Retroviral vectors that encode reporter proteins have been invaluable tools for analyzing retrovirus replication and restriction, but they have had limited utility in cell-to-cell infection studies due to high background noise resulting from reporter expression in the producer cells. We report the construction and characterization of retroviral vectors that express reporter protein exclusively in target cells and only after completing a full replication cycle. We have validated this approach and have begun to analyze cell and virus determinants for cell-to-cell infection with vectors for two human retroviruses that infect T cells. We show that the mechanism of transmission and ensuing virus replication depend on the particular virus, the effector and target cell types, and on the specific type of cell-cell interaction.","Human immunodeficiency virus (HTLV-1) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

We show that the effector cells transfected by reporter vector, packaging vector, and Env expression plasmid produced virus-like particles that transduced reporter gene activity into cocultured target cells in zero background. Reporter gene expression is detected exclusively in target cells and is required for Env-expression plasmids and viral packaging vector. The reporter protein is essential for structural enzymatic proteins for virus replication and is rarely detected in syncytia. Cell-cell fusion may contribute to infection, but the reporter protein rarely is detected during syncyticia. In addition, we show that cell-cell interactions may play an important role in altering cell-coupled interactions to enhance virus infection and replication."

The pathogen accomplishes this by secreting an arsenal of proteins, termed effectors, that function to modify host cells. Although hundreds of candidate effectors have been identified in P. infestans, their roles in pathogenicity or virulence remains basically unknown. Our results showed that one of these effectors functions to turn off resistance mediated by the potato gene RB. This effector accomplishes this by directly interacting with RB, which likely modifies its ability to turn on host resistance. Further molecular analysis identified two amino acids within the effector that determine interaction, which can assist in developing appropriate disease control strategies.","The potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, remains a major threat to potato production worldwide. Despite intensive breeding efforts, newly evolved pathogen strains consistently overcome major resistance genes. The potato RB gene, derived from the wild species Solanum bulbocastanum, confers resistance to P. infestan strains by recognition of members of the pathogen effector family IPI-O. However, the majority of the proteins recognized by the RB elicit resistance (e.g. IPI1, IPI2) and family members are able to elude detection (i.e., IPI4). In this study, we show that the protein that is recognized by IPI is critical for the interaction between the RB and the RB coiled coil (CC) domain. We also demonstrate that the amino acids that are critical for interaction with the RB CC domain are essential for the activation of the hypersensitive response (HR) elicitation of planta. Our results point to a critical step in the evolution of the gene family."

We present a comprehensive computational study of molecular mechanisms of kinase activation by cancer-causing mutations. Using a battery of computational approaches, we have systematically investigated the effects of clinically important cancer mutants on dynamics of the ABL and EGFR kinase domains and regulatory multi-protein complexes. The results of this study have illuminated common and specific features of the activation mechanism in the normal and oncogenic forms of ABL and EGFR. We have found that mutants with the higher oncogenic activity may cause a partial destabilization of the inactive structure, while simultaneously facilitating activating transitions and the enhanced stabilization of the active conformation. Our results provided useful insights into thermodynamic and mechanistic aspects of the activation mechanism and highlighted the role of structurally distinct conformational states in kinase regulation. Ultimately, molecular signatures of activation mechanisms in the normal and oncogenic states may aid in the correlation of mutational effects with clinical outcomes and facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies to combat kinase mutation-dependent tumorigenesis.","Kinase activation is a common mechanism of activation of cancer-causing mutations. However, the dynamics and mechanistic aspects of kinase activation in cancer mutations that stimulate conformational transitions and thermodynamic stabilization of the constitutively active kinase form remain elusive. Here, we present a large-scale computational investigation of the activation mechanisms of ABL EGFR kinase domains in a panel of clinically important cancer mutants. We simulated the activating effect of gatekeeper mutation conformational dynamics and allosteric interactions between functional states of the ABL-SH2-SH3 regulatory complexes. Our comprehensive analysis of computational approaches included homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, protein stability analysis, targeted molecular dynamics, molecular docking, and molecular docking. Collectively, our results show that thermodynamic mechanistic catalysts of activation by cancer mutations mimic the activation process of normal kinase, exploiting conserved structural catalysts to accelerate conformational transition and enhanced stabilization of an active protein."

Unfortunately this is not possible without a 24-month laboratory follow-up, which is problematic and largely unaccomplished in the field reality. Studies that assessed early indicators have used small cohorts, yielding limited statistical power plus potential bias because of including patients with equivocal outcome. We tackled this problem by pooling a large dataset which allowed for selecting cases providing strictly unequivocal information, still numerous enough to produce sound statistical evidence. We studied predictors based on the CSF leucocytes count, a laboratory technique already available in the field, evaluating their predictive power at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. We found a predictor at 6 months (10 leucocytes/µL of CSF) that has sub-optimal accuracy but may be valuable in some particular situations, plus two-step algorithms at 6 and 12 months that offer sufficient confidence to shorten the patients' follow-up. Until better biomarkers are identified, these findings represent a significant advance for this neglected disease. Benefits are foreseen both for patients and for overburdened treatment facilities. In addition, research for new treatments can be accelerated by using early predictors.","Human African trypanosomiasis is the most common parasitic disease in the world. The long post-treatment follow-up (24 months) required to assess cure complicates patient management and is a major obstacle to the development of new therapies. We analyzed individual patient data from 12 programs conducted by Médecins Sans Frontières in Uganda, Sudan, Angola, Central African Republic, Republic Congo and Democratic Republic Congo searching for early efficacy indicators. Patients were analyzed with confirmed second-stage disease complete follow-confirmed outcome (cure relapse) and CSF leucocytes counts (CSFLC) performed 6 months after treatment. We excluded patients with uncertain efficacy outcome: incomplete follow-through, death, relapse, and diagnosed CSFLC 50/µL trypanosis.

To develop an oncolytic therapy for treating patients with EBV-associated cancers, we need a method to efficiently induce synthesis of lytic EBV proteins. The EBV protein encoded by its immediate-early BZLF1 gene usually mediates the switch into lytic viral infection. We show here that HIF-1α, a cellular transcription factor that accumulates in cells when deprived of normal levels of oxygen, can induce lytic EBV infection. HIF-1α mediates this switch by directly binding to a specific sequence located within the BZLF1 gene promoter, activating its expression. Importantly, we also show that deferoxamine, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits degradation of HIF-1α, can induce synthesis of lytic EBV proteins in some EBV-positive epithelial and lymphocytic cell lines. These findings indicate that HIF-1α-stabilizing drugs, administered in combination with nucleoside analogues such as ganciclovir, may be helpful as part of a lytic-induction therapy for treating some patients with EBV-positive malignancies.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of gastric carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and Sal KemIII. EBV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and animals, and is a leading cause of death worldwide. In this study, we report that HIF-1α plays a central role in EBV-associated tumorigenesis. We show that the expression of HIFα in human oral keratinocyte (NOK) and gingival epithelial (hGET) cells induced the activation of a transcription consensus hypoxia-response element (HRE) located at nt-83-76 relative to the transcription initiation site. Furthermore, expression of EBV lytic gene expression in cells harboring wild-type EBV, cells infected with variants containing base-pair substitution mutations in HRE, was induced by EBV primary latent-lytic switch BZLF1 gene, Zp, activating the transcription consensus of the HRE.

The most distinctive visible feature of many neurons is the extensively branched network of cable-like projections that make up their dendritic tree. A neuron receives current-inducing synaptic contacts from other cells across its dendritic tree. As in the case of botanical trees, dendritic trees are strongly tapered towards their tips. This tapering has previously been shown to offer a number of advantages over a constant width, both in terms of reduced energy requirements and the robust integration of inputs at different locations. However, in order to predict the computations that neurons perform, analytical solutions for the flow of input currents tend to assume constant dendritic diameters. Here we introduce an asymptotic approximation that accurately models the current transfer in dendritic trees with arbitrary, continuously changing, diameters. When we then determine the diameter profiles that maximise current transfer towards the cell body we find diameters similar to those observed in real neurons. We conclude that the tapering in dendritic trees to optimise signal transmission is a fundamental architectural principle of the brain.","The dendritic tree is an extensive network of synapses that is required for computation in the brain. Dendritic tapering away from soma is suggested to equalise contributions from synapses at different locations to maximise current transfer of soma. We find that this is achieved precisely, and that an asymptotic approximation accurately matches results from numerical simulations. We also find that a simple quadratic form matches diameters obtained experimentally, indicating that the fundamental architectural principle of the brain links dendrites diameters to signal transmission."

A parallel group of participants were given 3-doses of licensed oral Ty21a vaccine as a positive comparator. We found that a single dose of M01ZH09 was not effective in preventing typhoid infection in our model, although significant effects were seen in delaying onset of infection and reducing bacterial numbers. Ty21a also failed to significantly protect against infection suggesting our model was particularly stringent. We discovered that anti-Vi antibodies, present in some individuals prior to vaccination, contributed significantly to preventing infection in some individuals, and when this effect was taken into account, M01ZH09 halved the risk of developing typhoid after being challenged. These results demonstrate the utility of human challenge models in assessing the efficacy of new typhoid vaccine candidates, and suggest that further development of M01ZH09 dosing or delivery strategies may produce better results.

This could include preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for migrants and young women in areas of severe food insecurity.Likewise, HIV programs that provide social and economic support to young women as part of an HIV prevention strategy should consider targeting areas affected by drought.Further studies should be done in other settings to investigate the external validity of these findings, particularly in terms of the impact on HIV in young women.","In Lesotho, there is an 11% greater prevalence of HIV-endemic rural areas due to local rainfall shocks.

This trend was shown not only by studying gene expression in single cells (Bahar et al. 2006), but at the coarse tissue resolution as well (Somel et al. 2006; Li et al. 2009). These led us to believe that looking at absolute changes in expression level alone may not tell the whole story of transcriptional changes in age. Instead the story may be in the more subtle changes in the coordination of expression among multiple genes. For this reason, we decided to look at changes in co-expression relationships with age. To this end, we developed a methodology for differential co-expression network analysis for the comparison gene co-expression on a global scale. We applied this methodology to compare co-expression between young (16-month) and old (24-month) mice. This allowed us to find both gene groups whose coordination appear to be affected by age and to propose potential mechanisms for the change. We believe our work is of broad importance because it represents a different paradigm for looking not only at aging but also at any complex condition or disease—away from changes in individual genes towards changes in gene relationships.","Gene co-expression networks are a method to look at large-scale transcriptional changes in aging. We have derived synonymous gene co- expression networks from AGEMAP expression data from 16-month-old and 24-month old mice. We identified a number of functional gene groups that change their expression in age and found a trend of declining correlation with age. In particular, we identified potential transcriptional mechanisms that may aid in modular correlation decline. We found computationally identified targets of NF-κB transcription factor decrease expression correlation at age. Finally, we found that genes prone to declining co-expressions tend to be co- located on the chromosome. These results indicate that transcription factors relating to chromosome domains and specific transcription factors may contribute to the decline."

The co-evolution of myxoma virus and the European rabbit following the introduction of the virus into Australia in 1950 is the canonical case of host jumping and host-pathogen co-evolution on a continental scale. This natural experiment was repeated with the release of a separate strain of myxoma virus in Europe. On both continents moderately attenuated strains of virus became dominant while rabbits were selected for resistance to myxomatosis. Here we examine the genotypic and phenotypic evolution of myxoma virus in Great Britain compared to Australia and show that despite ecological convergence and equivalent evolutionary rates, the virus has followed distinct evolutionary pathways on both continents with few shared mutations. Furthermore, we reveal novel mechanisms of pathogenesis and tissue tropism compared to the progenitor virus, and that the disruption of virulence genes is compatible with high virulence. This suggests that mutations have occurred that can compensate for the loss of virulence genes driven by the nexus between virulence and transmission in an ongoing host-pathogen arms race.","The co-evolution of myxoma virus (MYXV) in the European rabbit occurred independently in Australia and Europe, with different progenitor viruses. The canonical study of the evolution of virulence, genomic phenotypic outcomes and MYXV evolution in Europe and Australia is unknown. We addressed the question of whether viruses isolated from the United Kingdom were distinct lineages indicative of a long period of separation from independent evolution. We found that the rates of evolutionary change were identical to those previously described in Australia. However, genome evolution in UK and Australia showed little convergence. Inferred virulence ranged from highly virulent (grade 1) to highly attenuated (grade 5) and broad disease types were seen: cutaneous nodular myxomatosis characterized by multiple raised secondary cutaneous lesions, amyxomatous phenotype and secondary lesions. The novel clinical outcome was acute death of pulmonary oedema haemorrhage, associated with bacteria in the tissues in absence of inflammatory cells. Our data support the model of ongoing host-pathogen co-adaptation and suggest that multiple genetic pathways produce successful outcomes in the field."

However, under unfavourable environmental conditions plants also need to finance adaptive responses to ensure their survival. For this purpose a growth regulatory system is required to dynamically tune plant growth according to the plants’ prevailing energy status. Here, we characterize crucial components of this system that link plants’ energy management with root growth control. In detail, we demonstrate that a highly homologous group of energy-controlled regulators of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family redundantly operate under energy deprivation to control expression of a determinant of hormonally-controlled meristematic root growth. By these means these regulators constitute a central hub to integrate detrimental environmental stress conditions, which converge on energy limitation, into plant growth. Understanding the interplay between the plants’ energy homeostasis and growth control are of major importance for future strategies to engineer efficient crop plants.","Plants tightly control their energy homeostasis to ensure survival and fitness under constantly changing environmental conditions. In plants, plant growth is dynamically tuned according to prevailing energy availability. The evolutionary conserved SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1 RELATED KINASES1 (SnRK1) downstream group C/S1 basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) are well-characterised as central players in plants’ low-energy management. However, mechanistic insights into plant growth control under energy deprived conditions remain largely elusive. In this work, we reveal a novel function of low-Energy activated group S1 bZIP11-related TFs as regulators of auxin-mediated primary root growth. We demonstrate that bZip11-associated TFs interfere with the activity of the root apical meristem, which results in root growth repression and root growth loss-of-function in plants. Based on ensuing molecular biochemical analyses, we propose a mechanistic model in which the low- energy activated group of S1-c/s1-BZIPs gain control of root meristems directly by directly activating IAA3/SHY2 transcription. We also demonstrate that the BZIP1-C/S2-BzIP signalling module can integrate information about plant energy status and root-meristem control, balancing plant growth and cellular energy resources."

Several studies reported lack of correlation between the categories of the conventional classification and the disease severity. As a consequence, the World Health Organization proposed in 2008 a new classification that divides dengue into two categories: non-severe and severe dengue; the non-severe dengue is further divided into two categories: dengue with warning signs and dengue without warning signs. In this retrospective study we reviewed 357 cases of dengue diagnosed in our institution over a 4-year period to assess the validity of the new dengue classification in order to develop pragmatic guidelines for case triage and management in the Emergency Departments. We found that the sensitivity of the new classification for identifying severe cases was limited even though it had a higher sensitivity for identifying patients who needed advanced healthcare compared to the old one. We propose adding decompensation of chronic diseases and low platelets-related bleeding to the category of severe dengue in the new classification.

Anterograde and retrograde signals together with trans-synaptic complexes enable intercellular communications. How synapse activity status is monitored and relayed across the synaptic cleft remains poorly understood. The Drosophila NMJ is a very powerful genetic system to study synapse development. BMP signaling modulates NMJ growth via a canonical, Smad-dependent pathway, but also synapse stability, via a noncanonical, Smad-independent pathway. Here we describe a novel, noncanonical BMP pathway, which is genetically distinguishable from all other known BMP pathways. This pathway does not contribute to NMJ growth and instead influences synapse formation and maturation in an activity-dependent manner. Specifically, phosphorylated Smad (pMad in flies) accumulates at active zone in response to active postsynaptic type-A glutamate receptors, a specific receptor subtype. In turn, synaptic pMad functions to promote the recruitment of type-A receptors at synaptic sites. This positive feedback loop provides a molecular switch controlling which flavor of glutamate receptors will be stabilized at synaptic locations as a function of synapse status. Since BMP signaling also controls NMJ growth and stability, BMP pathway offers an exquisite means to monitor the status of synapse activity and coordinate NMJ growth with synapse maturation and stabilization.","BMP signaling is critical for synapse growth and homeostasis. Signaling of the BMP7 homolog, Gbb, in motor neurons triggers a canonical pathway that modulates transcription of BMP target genes, a noncanonical pathway, that connects local BMP/BMP receptor complexes to the cytoskeleton. Here, we describe a novel pathway that is characterized by accumulation of a pathway effector, phosphorylated Smad (pMad), at synaptic sites. We demonstrate that this pathway is genetically distinguishable from known BMP signaling cascades. We show that this novel pathway does not require Gbb and depends on presynaptic BMP receptors for specific postsynaptic glutamate receptor subtypes, type-receptor subtypes. Instead, selective disruption of the pMad accumulation reduces synaptic levels at type- receptors, revealing a positive feedback loop that appears to function to stabilize active type-Receptor synaptic sites and to stabilize synapse activity."

Sensing host-derived signals precedes adaptation, and triggers switching to the virulent state. Within mammalian cells L. monocytogenes responds to branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) deficiency by inducing virulence gene expression. In this study, we provide compelling evidence that fine tuning BCAA biosynthesis in L. monocytogenes allows the bacteria to sense isoleucine as a host-specific signal. Tightly controlled BCAA production depends on Rli60, a riboregulator, which is transcribed upstream to the BCAA biosynthesis genes. Rli60 functions as a ribosome mediated attenuator that cis-regulates BCAA production under limiting conditions. This study highlights the remarkable cross-regulation of metabolism and virulence in bacterial pathogens.","Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) saprophyte is an intracellular pathogen. The pathogenic state relies on sensing host-derived metabolites, but it remains unclear how these metabolites mediate virulence gene regulation. We previously found that low availability of isoleucine signals in Lm activate the virulent state, and this response is dependent on CodY, a global regulator of the enzyme biosynthesis pathway. We found that CodY represses metabolic pathways including branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) biosynthesis, BCAA depletion, and BCAA biosynthesis. In addition, we found that Lm controls the internal levels of BCAA in CodY and that this is mediated by a ribosome-mediated attenuator that cis-regulates downstream genes according to BCAA supply. We also found that Rli60 restricts BCAA production, essentially starving Lm, a mechanism that is directly linked to virulence, and controls the external levels of the internal isolesucine pool of CodY activity. Our findings suggest that the mechanism that controls BCAA auxotrophy may have evolved to enable isolucine to serve as a host signal as a virulence effector."

With the advent of “next-generation” sequencing platforms, it is now possible to rapidly sequence and assemble a vertebrate genome, especially for species for which genomic resources—genetic maps and markers—are currently available. We used a combination of two next-generation sequencing platforms, Roche 454 and Illumina GAII, and unique assembly tools to sequence the genome of the agriculturally important turkey, Meleagris gallopavo. Our draft assembly comprises approximately 1.1 gigabases of which 917 megabytes are assigned to specific chromosomes.

However, due to their complex process of assembly, production yields are commonly low hindering a fast transition from lab- to industrial-scale and ultimately to the patient. It is thus vital to understand the assembly mechanisms of these particles and to apply rational-oriented strategies for the manipulation of the host system and/or process conditions. In this context, mathematical models built on stability, kinetic and thermodynamic principles of protein macrostructures and respective assembly pathways are key elements. Indeed, using mathematical and thermodynamic concepts as building blocks, the model herein postulated provides valuable insights about the feasibility of VLP production systems. It demonstrates that the formation of complete and theoretically biological active VLP is restricted to a narrow range of volatile macro and micro physicochemical environments as well as intracellular protein expression rates. This study also finds direct application in the design of optimal in vitro physicochemical conditions for disassembly-reassembly experiments towards economical VLP production.","Virus-like-phosphates (VLPs) are a class of viral particles that are produced in recombinant host systems. In this study, we computationally investigate the case of a large triple-layer rotavirus VLP (RLP) that is produced in vitro and reassembled in vivo. We show that the rapid reversible assembly of RLP is due to the presence of untypical kinetic traps, strengthening fidelity to thermodynamically controlled assembly. We also show that under favourable conditions, the particles distribution is dominated by structural subunits completely built of icosahedra, intermediates present at residual concentrations. Under harshly unfavourable conditions, assembly yield is maximised and the VLP protein mass composition is obeyed. The effect is pronounced by a higher Gibbs free energy subunit association with a complex particle. Overall, our study shows that the correct formation of complex multi- layered VLPs is restricted to a narrow range of association energies at protein concentrations, and that the choice of host system is critical for successful assembly. Likewise, dynamic control of intracellular protein expression rates is important to minimize wasted proteins."

The existence of such “non-genetic individuality” was the first described many years ago for the flagellum-driven swimming behavior of bacteria. In this study, we identified a new bimodal switch controlling the expression of genes involved in flagellum biosynthesis and host interactions in the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila. This switch is modulated by a transcriptional regulator called FliZ. In addition to identifying all the specific genes up- and downregulated by FliZ, we showed that the concentration of FliZ fine-tuned the expression of FliZ target genes, resulting in individuals with different potentials for bacterial locomotion, host colonization and virulence.","Bacterial populations are composed of individuals with different phenotypes of clonal bacterial populations. The genes specifying motility and flagellar function are coordinately regulated in the form of a complex regulon, flagella regulon. FliZ, a DNA-binding protein, plays a key role in the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila, affecting hemolysin production and virulence in insects, and efficient swimming motility in insects. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the fliZ global regulatory protein is required for efficient expression of 278 of the Xenorhdus genes directly and indirectly. We also found that Fliz up-downregulates expression of numerous genes encoding non-flagellars and potentially involved in key steps in Xenorrhdus lifecycle.

However, how ecological and social processes together influence information transmission and its consequences for animal culture, particularly across space, remains largely unknown. We developed a spatially-explicit model examining the spread of behavioural preference through a population, which integrates two key processes: the movement of individuals in the landscape, and social learning with conformity (the disproportionate likelihood of adopting the behavioural trait that is most common locally). The model can replicate a real-world cultural diffusion experiment in great tits Parus major. It is also general, and allows us to make predictions about the emergence of animal cultures in a range of different ecological and social scenarios, including habitats with different states of fragmentation, species with varying movement patterns, and different strengths of conformity in the transmission of behaviour. Our results reveal a strong interplay between ecological and social processes (in this case, movement and conformity) for determining whether or not traditions establish within a population. If traditions do emerge, then these can either be local or global, depending on the relative strength of conformity compared to movement.","The emergence of social behaviour is critical for the emergence of animal culture. Several processes are predicted to play key roles in how socially-transmitted information spreads across animal populations: movement of individuals across the landscape and conformist social learning.

Contrary to this notion, we describe novel human anti-Zika virus (ZIKV) antibodies with very low mutation levels, isolated from plasmablasts early after the onset of symptoms. Surprisingly, one IgG monoclonal antibody, P1F12, bound to ZIKV and neutralized the virus, despite having no detectable mutations. This antibody is specific for ZIKV and did not cross-react with DENV. Furthermore, plasma from ZIKV-positive individuals blocked the interaction of P1F12 with ZIKV, whereas plasma from DENV-positive patients did not have this inhibitory ability. P1F12 targets an immunodominant site, as ZIKV-positive samples blocked P1F12-ZIKV binding.

The acute phase is asymptomatic in the majority of the cases and rarely causes inflammation of the heart or the central nervous system. Most infected patients progress to a chronic phase, characterized by cardiac or digestive involvement when not asymptomatic. However, when patients are also exposed to an immunosuppressant (such as chemotherapy), neoplasia, or other infections such as HIV, T. cruzi infection may develop into a severe disease (Chagas disease reactivation) involving the heart and central nervous system. The current microscopic methods for diagnosing Chagas disease reactivation are not sensitive enough to prevent the high rate of death observed in these cases. Therefore, we propose a quantitative method to monitor blood levels of the parasite, which will allow therapy to be administered as early as possible, even if the patient has not yet presented symptoms.","Reactivation of chronic Chagas disease occurs in approximately 20% of patients who are coinfected with HIV/Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and is commonly characterized by severe meningoencephalitis and myocarditis.

We begin with a computational model of cortical tissue and seek to understand its input/output transformations. Our approach limits confirmation bias, and differs from a more constructionist approach of starting with a computational theory and then creating a model that can implement its necessary features. We here choose a population-level modeling technique that does not sacrifice accuracy, as it well-approximates the mean firing-rate of a population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We extend this approach to simulate recurrently coupled neural populations, and characterize the computational properties of the Potjans and Diesmann cortical column model. We find that this model is capable of computing linear operations and naturally generates a subtraction operation implicated in theories of predictive coding. Although our quantitative findings are restricted to this particular model, we demonstrate that these conclusions are not highly sensitive to the model parameterization.","In the mammalian neocortex, the laminar structure performs functions integral to higher cognitive processes, including sensory perception, memory, and coordinated motor output. How do computations of the circuitry subserve a link between unique structural elements and function? Potjans Diesmann (2014) parameterized a cortical column with homogeneous populations of cell type dependent on connection probabilities. We implement a version of the displacement integro-partial differential equation (DiPDE) population density model, which provides a fast numerical method to solve equations describing the probability density distribution of neuronal membrane potentials. This approach lends quickly to analyzing the mean response properties of population-scale firing rate dynamics."

At the molecular scale, it is understood that adaptation should induce more genetic changes at amino acid altering sites in the genome, compared to amino acid–preserving sites. The ratio of substitution rates at such sites, denoted dN/dS, is therefore commonly used to detect proteins undergoing adaptation. This test was originally developed for application to distantly diverged genetic sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions along independent evolutionary lineages. Nonetheless, the dN/dS statistics are also frequently applied to genetic sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent transient polymorphisms, not substitutions. Here, we show that the behavior of the dN/dS statistic is very different in these two cases. In particular, when applied to sequences from a single population, the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to the strength of natural selection, and the anticipated signature of adaptive evolution, dN/dS>1, is violated. These results have implications for the interpretation of genetic variation sampled from a population. In particular, these results suggest that microbes may experience substantially stronger selective forces than previously thought.","Evolutionary pressures in proteins are quantified by the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous synonymous sites. The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for the application of distantly diverged sequences, where differences represent substitutions fixed in independent lineages. However, when applied to sequences sampled from a single population, differences represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we show that the dN /dsS ratio in samples drawn from single population selection is a relatively insensitive selection coefficient. We find that the hallmark signature of positive selection in divergent lineages, dN2/dsS>1, is not violated in the population. In population samples, the relationship between selection and dN1/ds2 follow a monotonic function, making it impossible to infer selection pressures from dN. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN and dS measurements in population-genetic samples."

We have found that even when helper CD4 T cells are profoundly reduced in a mouse model that mimics this defect in AIDS, other remaining T cells are capable of mounting vaccine immunity against a deadly fungal infection, and they do so by producing the powerful, soluble product, IL-17. It has been widely believed that the activation and instruction of such cells, called Tc17 cells, is governed by another population of immune cells in the body, but we have found here that pathways within these Tc17 cells themselves mediate their activation and ability to produce the IL-17 needed for resistance to infection. We have also identified elements of the circuitry controlling this pathway—elements called MyD88, Akt1 and mTOR—and found that they control the production of IL-17 and not other products such as IFN-γ often produced by these cells. Further, we determined that this circuitry controls the development of Tc17 cells by regulating their ability to divide and expand. Thus, in a mouse model of vaccination against lethal fungal pneumonia caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis, we uncovered an important cellular arsenal that can be recruited to bolster resistance against a fungal infection, and identified novel ways in which the cells develop and expand into potent killers of fungi.","Fungal infections have skyrocketed in immune-competent patients lacking CD4+ T cells, underscoring the need for vaccine prevention.

In the past, many approaches have looked for deterministic motifs in protein sequences, by searching for functionally over-represented k-mers, with moderate levels of success. Here we revisit and renew the utility of deterministic motifs, by searching for them in a partially unsupervised and context-dependent manner. Using a novel motif extraction algorithm, MEX, deterministic sequence motifs are extracted from Swiss Prot data containing more than 50,000 enzymes. They are then filtered by the Enzyme Commission classification hierarchy to produce sets of specific peptides (SPs). The latter specify enzyme function for 93% of the data, comparing well with existing approaches for enzyme classification. Importantly, SPs are found to have biological significance. A majority of all known active and binding sites of enzymes are covered by SPs, and many SPs are found to lie within spatial pockets in the neighborhood of the active sites. Both these results have extremely high statistical significance. A user-friendly tool that displays the hits of SPs for any protein sequence that is presented as a query, together with the EC assignments due to these SPs, is available at http://adios.tau.ac.il/SPSearch.","Predicting the function of a protein sequence is a long-standing goal of bioinformatic research.

Here, we use time-lapse microscopy to quantify the nuclear localization of several proteins in response to Wnt signaling throughout early embryonic development in the nematode worm, C. elegans. We find that cells that received a Wnt signal in the previous division respond more strongly to a Wnt signal in the next division, in part by localizing more of the regulator β-catenin to the nucleus. This causes the relative enrichment of Wnt pathway proteins in the nuclei of repeatedly signaled cells, which we show likely impacts the activation of Wnt target genes. This represents a novel mechanism for the regulation of Wnt pathway targets in development and disease.","The Wnt signaling pathway plays a conserved role in animal development and transcriptional regulation of distinct targets in different developmental contexts.

We therefore know little about the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance in P. vivax and have yet to develop tools to experimentally understand drug resistance, which limits the ability to adapt drug policies and reduce the spread of resistance. Here, we used a related parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, as a model system to investigate genes that might be involved in P. vivax drug resistance. Multiple P. vivax proteins were expressed and their location in P. knowlesi was explored using organellar markers. None of the candidates induced changes in parasite response to chloroquine or mefloquine, two front-line antimalarials for which resistance is a concern in P. vivax. This could be due to technical reasons, or could indicate that these genes do not actually play a role in resistance.

They can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from mild gastrointestinal complaints to debilitating illness and even death. Especially in low-income countries where animals play an important role for many, the burden of these diseases can be substantial. However, there is often little attention for these diseases, thus they remain under-researched and underfunded. In this review, we present estimates of the burden of the most important zoonotic diseases in Kyrgyzstan for the reference year 2013. We estimated the burden by calculating the incidence-based disability adjusted life years (DALYs), allowing comparison between diseases and injuries. Disease frequency data is scarce and hospital-based incidence data often underestimates the true incidence of the disease. By addressing the underestimation in officially reported incidence using data from our systematic review, we estimated the true incidence of the most important zoonoses in Kyrgyzstan. We quantified the substantial impact these diseases have on the wellbeing of people in Kyrgyzstan in 2013. The results underline the need for more intensive monitoring and surveillance of zoonotic diseases.","Zoonotic disease (ZD) poses a threat to human health in low-income countries.

Mice lacking such LNs (called alymphoplastic) are severely immune compromised and resistant to immunizations. We discovered that the immune-deficiency of such alymphoplastic mice is actually not caused by the loss of LNs, but rather by the underlying genetic lesion. Surprisingly, mice lacking all lymph nodes can still mount potent T cell-mediated immune responses. We also discovered that T and B cells have completely different structural requirements for their activation/maturation. Whereas B cells rely on LNs to become efficient antibody-producing cells, T cells can be activated successfully outside of such dedicated tissues. So—in the absence of LNs—antigens delivered by immunization are actively transported into the liver where cellular immunity is initiated. The mammalian fetal liver is responsible for the early formation of blood and immune cells, and we propose that the adult liver can still provide a niche for T cell–antigen encounters. During evolution, T and B cells emerged simultaneously, allowing cold-blooded vertebrates (which lack LNs) to launch adaptive immune responses. The development of LNs in mammals coincided with a drastic improvement in antibody affinity maturation, whereas T cells remain LN-independent to this day.","Subcutaneous immunization delivers antigen (Ag) to local Ag-presenting cells, which subsequently migrate to draining lymph nodes (LNs). In mammals, the structural environment of secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) is considered essential for initiation of adaptive immunity. However, cold-blooded vertebrates initiate potent systemic immune responses that lack conventional SLTs. In this study, we combine two different strains of alymphoplastic mice with T cell migration mutants in an experimental paradigm for the site of Ag delivery and a distant site of priming inflammation. We show that in mammals, SLTs serve primarily as B cell priming and affinity maturation, whereas induction of T cell-driven immune responses occur outside SLTs, and that in mice lacking conventional SLT, they generate productive systemic CD4- and CD8-mediated responses. These findings provide an alternative pathway for induction of cell-mediated immunity."

It has been speculated that membrane voltage fluctuations in neurons play an important role in scaling the relationship between input amplitude and spike rate response. For this to be true, neuronal spike input-output behavior must be sensitive to physiological membrane voltage fluctuations. Using a combination of single cell recordings and modeling, we investigated the mechanisms through which voltage fluctuations modulate neuronal input-output responses. We find that neurons that express an increase in membrane input resistance with depolarization show low levels of noise-mediated modulation of input-output responses due, in part, to voltage trajectories that suppress the likelihood of generating a spike in response to random current input fluctuations. Hence, non-linear membrane properties arising from certain types of voltage-gated conductances limit noise-based modulation of neuronal input-output responses.","The degree of neuronal input-output responses arising from synaptic activity is critical for models to gain control of neuronal output gating, spike rate coding, and coding. However, the extent to which these mechanisms are modulated by voltage fluctuations has been largely simplified models of spike generation, with limited consideration of the role of non-linear voltage-dependent membrane properties. To address these issues, we studied fluctuation-based modulation of output responses in medial entorhinal cortical (MEC) stellate cells in rats. In vitro recordings, dynamic clamp modeling, and in vivo recordings, we found that modulation of input-out responses to random voltage fluctuations in stellates cells was significantly limited. Similarly, a voltage-dependently increase in membrane resistance to sub-sub-temporal voltages mediated by Na+ conductance activation limits the ability of fluctuations to elicit spikes. Thus, our results demonstrate that the low degree of voltage-dependence is a universal feature of neurons and significantly limited subthreshold voltage-gated conductances."

However, the mechanisms by which bacteria persist in host cells are poorly understood. Legume peptides and the bacterial BacA membrane protein play essential roles in enabling bacteria to establish prolonged legume infections. However, the biological function of BacA in persistent legume infections has eluded scientists for nearly two decades. In this article, we investigated a potential relationship between legume peptides and BacA in the establishment of prolonged bacterial-legume infections. We found that BacA was critical to protect bacteria against the antimicrobial action of legume peptides, thereby allowing the peptides to induce bacterial persistence within the legume rather than rapid bacterial death. Mammalian hosts also produce peptides in response to invading microorganisms and BacA proteins are critical for medically important bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis to form prolonged mammalian infections. Therefore, our results suggest that BacA-mediated protection against host peptides might be a conserved mechanism used by both symbiotic and pathogenic bacterial species to establish long-term host infections.","Sinorhizobium meliloti is one of the most important nematode species in the world.

However, some strains of H. pylori express a bacterial secretion system, a sort of molecular syringe that injects a bacterial protein inside the gastric cells and causes inflammation that can lead to peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer. One of the essential components of the H. pylori secretion system is CagY, which is unusual because it contains a series of repetitive amino acid motifs that are encoded by a very large number of direct DNA repeats. Here we have shown that DNA recombination in cagY changes the protein motif structure and alters the function of the secretion system—turning it on or off. Using mouse and non-human primate models, we have demonstrated that CagY is a molecular switch that “tunes” the host inflammatory response, and likely contributes to persistent infection. Determining the mechanism by which CagY functions will enhance our understanding of the effects of H. pylori on human health, and could lead to novel applications for the modulation of host cell function.","Helicobacter pylori causes clinical disease primarily in individuals infected with the strain.

CagY is an essential component of the T4SS and has an unusual sequence structure, with an extraordinary number of direct DNA repeats predicted to cause rearrangements that invariably yield frame insertions and deletions. We demonstrate that the immune-driven host selection and rearrangement of CAGY is sufficient to gain the loss of function of the H. pylor T.4SS. We propose that the cagY functions as a sort of molecular switch that “ tunes” the host inflammatory response to maximize persistent infection."

Expression noise can be disadvantageous, by affecting the precision of biological functions, but it may also be advantageous by enabling heterogeneous stress-response programs to environmental changes. Therefore various genes and gene groups might display various levels of expression noise. Importantly, gene expression is a multi-step process and the stochasticity of its individual steps, including transcription and translation, contributes to the resulting variability. Recent single cell analyses of gene expression in yeast have confirmed the theoretically predicted general trend where expression noise scales with protein abundance. However, some deviations from this basic trend have also been observed, prompting questions about the contribution of gene-specific features to such deviations. Accounting for noise heterogeneity in different gene groups, we revealed a clear relationship between noise and translation-related genomic features, specifically codon usage and 5′ UTR secondary structure. Our results suggest that the effect of translation on these deviations might be more prominent than previously appreciated, and provide important clues towards understanding expression stochasticity in yeast.","In eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated by a series of processes, including transcription, translation, degradation of mRNA proteins, and protein abundance. Recent single cell analyses of gene expression in yeast uncovered a general trend in expression noise that scales protein abundance and gene expression copy number. However, deviations from this basic trend were observed, prompting questions about the contribution of gene-specific features to these deviations. For example, recent studies have pointed to the TATA box sequence feature as a feature that may influence expression noise by facilitating expression bursts. We asked whether the extent to which sequence features are known postulated to accompany translation efficiency is associated with an increase in noise strength, on average, when the increase compares to the amplification associated with the TAT box. We found that expression noise is highly nontrivial, and gene gene gene-module specific. In particular, we found that ribosomal genes display a different relationship between expression noise and codon usage compared to genes with high expression noise. Interestingly, we also found that the expression noise associated with high codons usage correlated with increased noise relative to the average noise of proteins abundance. These findings suggest that the effect of translation noise on gene expression may be prominent and previously appreciated."

These include the need to protect itself against the toxic oxidants used by the host to kill invading microbes, and the need to scavenge iron, an essential micronutrient that is limiting in certain tissues. The iron-containing enzyme, catalase, detoxifies hydrogen peroxide, thereby playing a major role in protecting C. albicans against reactive oxygen species and neutrophil killing. Indeed, we show that high basal catalase expression increases the resistance of this yeast to oxidative and combinatorial (oxidative plus cationic) stresses. Yet, rather than enhancing the virulence of C. albicans as had been predicted, high basal catalase expression decreases fungal colonisation in certain iron-limiting tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that catalase inactivation does not significantly perturb the virulence of C. albicans in models of systemic infection. We also show that ectopic catalase expression increases the demand for iron in C. albicans, thereby reducing the fitness of this pathogen in the absence of stress under iron-limiting conditions. Therefore, high basal catalase expression is a double-edged sword: it enhances the fitness of C. albicans in the presence of stress, but reduces fitness in the absence of stress. This explains why catalase overexpression reduces rather than enhances virulence.","Fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans and Candida melanogaster display robust protective oxidative stress responses that contribute to pathogenicity. The induction of enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an essential component of these responses. In this study, we show that the ectopic expression of the heme-containing catalase enzyme Candida anbicans enhances resistance to oxidative stress, combinatorial oxidative plus cationic stress, and phagocytic killing. We show that ectopic catalases expression confers fitness advantages in the presence of stress, but not in the absence of stress. Furthermore, we find that high basal and tetON-CAT1 expressors attenuate the fitness advantage of the isogenic barcoded CAT1, cat1Δ tetON and CAT1 strains. These findings reinforce our analyses of phenotypically diverse clinical isolates and suggest that the stochastic variation in catal enzyme expression in stress resistance is associated with a fitness defect in genetically homogeneous strains."

The disease is caused by the parasitic worms known as schistosomes. In the Philippines, S. japonicum is the causative agent of the disease. The prevalence of the disease varies in endemic areas, suggesting that the parasite populations might differ in their genetic composition and infectivity to the human host. In this study, DNA samples of adult worms from seven endemic municipalities were analyzed. Characterization of S. japonicum samples in different endemic sites with varying prevalence provides information on the genetic diversity of the parasite. Results of this study showed that samples in high prevalence endemic areas like Irosin, Catarman and Socorro were genetically diverse as compared to other areas. Information on parasite genetic diversity is therefore important in planning disease control strategies. The results suggest ongoing parasite transmission across geographic endemic areas which should be monitored and used as reference for genetic diversity of the schistosomes attributed to geographic areas, thus a safeguarding precaution should be implemented to ensure localized elimination of the disease.","Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Schistosoma japonicum. The disease is transmitted by the larvae of the parasite, which are transmitted by infected hosts. In Asia and Africa, the identification of different geographical strains of the disease by microsatellites can pave the way for better understanding the transmission and epidemiology of the parasitic disease. In the Philippines, the present study aims to apply microsatellite markers to analyzing populations of S. japonica in different endemic areas of the Philippines. The results of the study show that the genetic diversity of parasite populations in the endemic areas can be determined by genetic surveillance. The degree of genetic diversity observed in the parasite population in endemic areas varies. Geographical separation is considered as one of the factors accounting for the observed difference in parasite genotypes in the present population. Clustering analysis showed particular spatial structuring and structuring in parasite populations between different endemic and endemic areas. Based on the results of this study, it is reasonable to conclude that genetic diversity is a possible criterion to assess the infection status in highly endemic areas, and indirectly reflects the success of the control program in schistosomeiasis-endemic areas."

We are investigating multiple hybrid necrosis cases in Arabidopsis thaliana that are caused by allele-specific interactions between different variants at two unlinked resistance (R) gene clusters, RESISTANCE TO PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 7 (RPP7) and RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8 (RPW8)/HOMOLOG OF RPW8 (HR). The RPP7 locus encodes intracellular nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors that can confer strain-specific resistance to oomycetes, while the RPW8/HR locus encodes atypical resistance proteins, of which some can confer broad-spectrum resistance to filamentous pathogens. There is extensive structural variation in the RPW8/HR cluster, both at the level of gene copy number and at the level of C-terminal, 21- or 14-amino acid long RPW8/HR repeats. We demonstrate that the number of RPW8/HR repeats and the short C-terminal tail correlate, in an allele-specific manner, with the severity of hybrid necrosis when these alleles are combined with RPP7 variants. We discuss these findings in light of sequence similarity between RPW8/HR and pore-forming toxins MLKL and HET-S from mammals and fungi.","In many plant species, conflicts between divergent elements of the immune system, especially nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLR), can lead to hybrid necrosis.

For successful replication, pathogens have adapted metabolically to the intracellular niche. While this adaptation is fundamental to the ability to cause disease, we know little about pathogen's intracellular metabolism and its association with virulence. In this study we took a global approach that combines computational and experimental methods to decipher the intracellular metabolic requirements of the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We identified 12 metabolic pathways to be differentially active during infection in comparison to growth in rich lab media. We validated the essentiality of the active pathways for L. monocytogenes intracellular replication. Pathways included: biosynthesis of histidine, arginine, purine, and branch chain amino acids (BCAAs), as well as the catabolism of L-rhamnose and glycerol. Next we analyzed whether the requirement for these nutrients associates with virulence. We found that limiting concentrations of BCAAs, primarily of isoleucine, results in robust induction of the bacterial virulence state, a response that is dependent on the isoleucine responsive regulator, CodY. CodY was responsible for the up-regulation of the major virulence regulator of L. monocytogenes, PrfA. This study supports the premise that pathogens metabolism and virulence are closely interlinked.","Intracellular bacterial pathogens are metabolically adapted to grow in mammalian cells. However, little is known about the relationship between pathogen metabolism and virulence. The integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool combines transcriptome data and genome-scale metabolic models to define metabolic requirements for Listeria monocytogenes infection. We identified differentially active metabolic pathways in L. monocytic growth in macrophage cells. Intracellular replication requires de novo synthesis of histidine, arginine, purine, branch chain amino acids (BCAAs) and catabolism of L-rhamnose glycerol. The importance of this metabolic pathway in infection was confirmed in the generation of gene knockout mutants from the respective pathways. We also investigated the association between metabolic requirements and the regulation of virulence by the master virulence activator gene, prfA, and the PrfA-regulated genes. Our analysis demonstrated that the master isoleucine activator, CodY, plays a critical role in the regulation and regulation of prfa activation under the limiting conditions of BCAAs. Our study evidences an additional regulatory mechanism underlying L. maturation."

Clinical expression of human toxoplasmosis, as well as T. gondii strains diversity, exhibit contrasting patterns across geographic regions. The determinants of this geographical structure are poorly understood, but a growing body of evidence supports an important role of human-mediated migrations of T. gondii hosts in the intercontinental dissemination of some parasite lineages. The results of our study conducted in Senegal suggest that the invasive house mouse—which was introduced in the port cities of this country through maritime trade since colonial times—has a dramatic influence on the T. gondii populations of invaded areas. This important T. gondii reservoir seems to be a vector for the intercontinental migrations of T. gondii. In addition, it may have a role in the selection (or the counter-selection) of local T. gondii populations found in invaded areas.

Both microscopic and molecular stool-based diagnostic methods will be used to evaluate drug efficacy. DNA samples will also be analysed for the presence and prevalence of mutations in a gene that was previously linked to AR in animal STHs.

In particular, it has often been assumed that population dynamics, controlled by ecological circumstances such as the presence of predators or disease, occur at such different timescales compared with evolutionary dynamics that they are effectively de-coupled. Recent studies, however, have found that evolution can occur over ecological timescales and thus may have important effects on ecological dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a tight coupling between population dynamics and the evolutionary dynamics of a “social” microbial gene, which allows a laboratory population of budding yeast to cooperatively break down sucrose and grow on the simpler sugars released from it. In such cooperative populations, evolution may favor non-cooperative, or “cheater” individuals that do not contribute to the public good (in this case, the products of sucrose break down), but still use that public good to grow at the expense of the individuals that do cooperate. Our study shows that a population of cooperators that is invaded by cheaters does not collapse as a result of cheater proliferation but can evolve to a viable equilibrium. However, the coexisting population is less resilient to perturbations.","The emergence of cheater strategies can destabilize populations by engaging in social cooperative behaviors, demonstrating the potential for bi-directional coupling between population density and evolution of a cooperative trait. Despite the potential importance of eco-evolutionary feedback loops in social species, their experimentally and experimentally ecological implications are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a strong feedback loop in population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics of a social microbial gene, SUC2, in laboratory yeast populations. We directly visualize the eco- evolutionary trajectories of hundreds of populations over 50–100 generations, allowing us to characterize phase space describing the interplay between evolution and ecology in a system. Small populations collapse despite continual evolution and increased cooperative allele frequencies; large populations are in a stable state of coexistence between cooperator and cheater. The presence of cheaters significantly affects equilibrium population density, reducing the resilience of the population to adapt to a rapidly deteriorating environment. Our results demonstrate the potential ecological importance of coupling evolutionary dynamics and population dynamics in cooperatively growing organisms, particularly microbes."

Innate immune cells are required to detect and contain infection while specific adaptive T cells are activated and recruited to infection sites. Adaptive immunity enhances the function of innate cells and also directly kills infected cells to prevent further bacterial propagation. These cells respond to local environmental cues and often communicate via direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we observed cellular dynamics in situ by imaging live tissue using intravital microscopy. We reconstituted the Lm infection model with bacteria and mouse strains engineered to express fluorescent proteins to label specfic cells. We find that dendritic cells (DC) in the spleen rapidly capture Lm from circulation, demonstrating a direct role of these cells in sequestering bacteria. Neutrophils converge on infected cells by directed migration to generate exanguinous foci within the otherwise blood rich red pulp. Finally, antigen specific CD8+ T cell interact extensively with infected cells and DC in the foci and are selectively retained compared to non-specific polyclonal T cells. These findings significantly advance our understanding of immune cell dynamics in the spleen in both the steady state and in response to Listeria infection. These studies could aid in development of disease therapies and vaccine strategies targeted towards enhancing DC, myelomonocytic and CD8+ T cell effector responses.","Host defense against the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) requires innate adaptive immunity. In this study, we directly imaged immune cell dynamics and Lm foci established in dendritic cells in subcapsular red pulp (scDC) using intravital microscopy. Blood borne Lm was rapidly associated with scDC and swarmed non-motile scDC forming foci with blood flow excluded. The depletion of scDC foci resulted in a 10-fold reduction in viable Lm, and a 30–1000 fold increase in viable lm and enhanced blood flow. Effector CD8+ T cells at sites of infection displayed a two-tiered reduction in motility and antigen independent antigen dependent components, including stable interactions with infected and non-infected scDC. These findings suggest that scDC may contribute to control of Lm prior to development of T cell immunity."

In contrast to previous experimental studies, which describe saturating relationships between ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, we show that in reef fish systems, functioning (as standing biomass) accelerates with the addition of new species. This non-saturating relationship implies unique contributions of species to the functioning of this ecosystem and indicates that the consequences of losing biodiversity are significantly greater than previously anticipated. We also demonstrate a negative effect of human density on reef fish functioning such that for the same number of people the loss of standing biomass is significantly larger in more diverse ecosystems. Unfortunately, human effects can arise through multiple stressors (such as fishing, coastal development, and land use) and are widespread and likely to worsen, as some 75% of the world's coral reefs are currently nearby human settlements and because almost all countries with coral reefs are expected to double their populations within the next 50 to 100 years. Our results call for both further investigation of the impact of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and strategies to manage and prevent the increasing intensity and expansion of anthropogenic stressors in coastal areas.","The global survey of reef fish assemblages shows that ecosystem functioning ( measured standing biomass) scales in a non- saturating manner in biodiversity (i.e., biodiversity is measured by species functional richness) and ecosystem functioning.

These results indicate that the consequences of biodiversity loss on coral reefs are considerably underestimated based on existing knowledge of reefs and assemblage, particularly diverse, and greatly vulnerable to the expansion intensity of anthropogenic stressors in coastal areas."

Furthermore it emphasizes that DAF-16 activity is highly dependent on the cellular context and communication between different tissues.","In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the promotion of longevity by the transcription factor DAF-16 requires reduced insulin/IGF receptor (IIR) signaling ablation in the germline, a reason for its negative impact on germ cells is unknown. Here, we show that somatic expression of DAF–16 in germ cells inhibits germline proliferation in daf-2 mutants of gld-1 tumors. In contrast to the somatic function of the tumor suppressor FOXO/DAF-15, the presence of IIR signaling does not result in tumorigenic activity, but counteracts robust lifespan extension. We also show that the cell-autonomous role of FOXO-16 in stem cell proliferation results in hyperplasia and germline disruption in the surrounding basement membrane. Our data suggest that the functional balance between DAF and IIR activities in different tissues determines longevity."

For over 10 years, it has been assumed that there are four, and only four, distinct AP complexes in eukaryotic cells. We report the existence of a fifth AP complex, AP-5. Immunolocalisation and RNAi knockdown experiments both indicate that AP-5 is involved in trafficking proteins from endosomes towards other membranous compartments. There are genetic links between AP-5 and hereditary spastic paraplegia, a group of human genetic disorders characterised by progressive spasticity in the lower limbs.

Several distinct AP complexes have been identified, present in eukaryotes. Here, we report the existence of a fifth AP complex, AP-5, which localises in the late endosomal compartment of HeLa cells. We show that the AP subunits associate with clathrin insensitive brefeldin A.

Based on simulation results, we show that the mechanisms underlying stable physiologically realistic activity remain obscure. We employ mean-field reduction dynamics, which allows us to include activity constraints in the process of model construction. We shape phase space in a multi-scale network model of vision-related areas in macaque brain and systematically refine connectivity.

The parasite’s complex lifecycle includes sexual and asexual reproduction outside and inside the host, respectively. The parasite can also asexually complete a life cycle within the host's body, which is called autoinfection causing life-long infection. In order to investigate the population structure and transmission patterns of this parasite we sequenced individual nematodes isolated from human faeces in Japan and Myanmar, where the parasite is present at low and high frequencies, respectively. Whole genome sequencing of small parasites is generally difficult because the amount of DNA is limiting. However, we overcame this problem by combining whole genome amplification with next-generation sequencing. Sequence comparisons revealed 0.6% of the genome is variable among samples, and the variants showed clear separation by the location of their origin. We found that heterozygosity within the genomes was higher in Japan, which is likely explained by the predominance of asexual reproduction through auto-infection, suggesting that analyses of heterozygosity are required to better understand the history of a population.","The helminth Strongyloides stercoralis, transmitted from soil to soil, infects 30–100 million people worldwide. The parasite reproduces sexually outside the host asexually and causes a life-long infection. To understand the population structure and transmission patterns of the parasite, we sequenced the genomes of 33 individual S. stercororalis nematodes collected from Myanmar (most prevalent region) and Japan (non-most prevalent). We utilised a method combining genome amplification and generation sequencing techniques to detect 298,202 variant positions (0.6% of the genome) compared to the reference genome. Phylogenetic analyses of SNP data revealed unambiguous geographical separation between sub-populations and correlated with host geographical origin, particularly in Myanmar samples. The relatively higher heterozygosity in Japanese samples is possibly explained by independent evolution of haplotypes in diploid genomes during the asexual reproduction and auto-infection cycle, suggesting that analysing the genetic diversity of the parasites may be useful to infer the infection history and geographical prevalence."

The elderly motion is noisy and less efficient, however, and once movements in response to a disturbance begin, they are at a lower speed. One can model subject response by assuming that it results from combining noise and a response that is mathematically optimal given this noise, delay, and a least-squares sort of control objective. This modeling approach is appropriate for young and most elderly subjects. The model holds that increased noise should lead to no change in delay until response gets underway, but should make the response itself proceed at a slower speed. This is consistent with the data and with a causal link from the observed noise and disorder in elderly motor function to the observed age-related slowing.","Age-related changes in motor response to noise have been observed in a number of studies. However, it is not clear how age-related age changes affect motor responses to noise. In this study, we used a Bayesian quadratic optimality approach to construct a model of motor response in the face of noise. We show that the model is consistent with the observed age-associated increase in latency onset of response perturbation, and a substantial slowing of response response. The model is tractable and can be used to quantitatively formulate a long-standing hypothesis of age-induced slowing adaptation to increased noise."

Its transmission also involves multiple complex or even hidden factors, such as climate, social environment, vector ecology, and host mobility. These complexities make the underlying process of dengue transmission difficult to clarify. We address how the patterns of dengue transmission can be inferred by investigating the 2014 dengue outbreak in the city of Guangzhou, China, taking the available surveillance data and applying mathematical models and computational methods. We can then estimate the distribution of dengue infections and identify the transmission mechanisms. In our study, we systematically investigate the critical factors, enabling us to estimate the real patterns and dynamics of dengue transmission beyond the surveillance data.","Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The current situation is complicated by factors such as climate warming, urbanization, population increase, and human mobility. The purpose of this study was to detect dengue transmission patterns and identify disease dispersion dynamics in Guangzhou, China.

Based on available data and Ross-Macdonald theory, we propose a model that systematically integrates entomologic, demographic, and environmental information. Using this model, we use (1) BI data and geographic variables to evaluate the spatial heterogeneities of Aedes and mosquitoes, (2) radiation model to simulate daily mobility of humans, and (3) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to estimate model parameters. By implementing the proposed model, (1), we estimate incidence rates of dengues, trace infection time locations, and assess risk factors. We also evaluate the primary diffusion process in different districts. Our results show that Dengue infections exhibited spatial and temporal variation in 2014 Guangzhou."

Death from dengue infection occurs mostly in DSS, and the mortality of DSS is reportedly 50 times higher compared to that of dengue patients without DSS. Several factors associated with DSS have been reported in individual studies; however, the associations for some factors are not observed consistently across studies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to clarify this issue.

Existing models of this selectivity rely on varying relative importance of feedforward thalamic input and intracortical influence. Recently, we have shown that pairwise timing relationships between single thalamic neurons can be predictive of a high degree of orientation selectivity. Here we have constructed a computational model that predicts cortical orientation tuning from thalamic populations. We show that this arrangement, relying on precise timing differences between thalamic responses, accurately predicts tuning properties as well as demonstrates that certain timing relationships are optimal for transmitting information about the stimulus to cortex.","The emergence of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex is attributed to a complex interaction between the feed-forward thalamic input and inhibitory mechanisms at the level of the cortex. Previous studies have shown that cortical neurons are highly sensitive to timing and timing of the input, but the role of stimulus-driven timing and thalamus inputs in cortical orientation selectivities has not been fully understood. Here, we show that synchronization of the firing of neurons in the cortex contributes directly to orientation tuned responses to primary visual cortical stimuli in a way that optimizes stimulus information from the cortical spike. We show that the synchronization of firing of cortical neurons contributes to orientation tuning in response to naturalistic stimuli. Our findings indicate that a prominent role for feed-back thalamamic input in cortical feature selectivity is based on the synchronization between the input and the input."

The ability of neutrophils to reach these sites, a key feature in the resolution of infections, is mediated by their capacity to sense and migrate directionally to the core of the inflammation site. Chemicals released at the site of inflammation are known as primary attractants. The binding of these attractants to receptors on the surface of neutrophils leads to the secretion of secondary attractants that amplify the reach of primary attractants. We studied the mechanism by which secondary attractants are released from neutrophils. We found that the secretion of a key secondary attractant is mediated in the form of small vesicles called exosomes. These exosomes originate inside the cells, encapsulated in larger vesicles called multivesicular bodies. We purified exosomes from activated neutrophils and show that they contain the machinery to synthesize this secondary attractant and act specifically to elicit neutrophil motility. The inhibition of exosome release leads to a loss of secretion of the secondary attractant as well as a loss in directional motility. Together, our findings provide insight into the mechanisms cells use to protect labile attractants from harsh extracellular environments and communicate directional cues during inflammatory responses.","Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is secreted by chemotactic neutrophils, forming a secondary gradient that amplifies the reach of the primary chemoattractant.

Purified exosome release leads to loss of directional motility and concomitant loss of LTB 4 release. Our findings establish that the exosomal pool of L TB4 acts in an autocrine fashion to sensitize neutrophill to the primary and chemoassractant, and in a paracrine fashion to mediate recruitment of neighboring neutrophiles to trans.

This is ensured through the meiotic divisions, which initially fasten identical chromosomes through DNA linkages that hold them together until the cell is ready to separate them. To make these linkages, called crossovers, the cell breaks the DNA in many places, and must repair them to create a crossover, or a noncrossover. We investigate here the role of ZHP-4, and its partner ZHP-3 which form a complex that associates along paired chromosomes and finally with crossover sites. ZHP-3/4 are conserved proteins found in many organisms that function in recruiting proteins required to decide which DNA event will become a crossover and how this DNA event is coordinated with changes in chromosome structure. Using mutations that reduce the function of ZHP-4, we show that the complex cannot localize normally to meiotic chromosome and that crossing over fails. Our results suggest that ZHP-3/4 work at early and late steps in the process to stabilize other factors required for crossover formation.","Correct segregation of meiotic chromosomes depends on DNA crossovers (COs) that are homologs that culminate in visible physical linkages called chiasmata. COs emerge from a larger population of joint molecules (JM) and are repaired by noncrossovers. However, the majority of noncrossover COs are repaired through genomic integrity. Here, we present evidence that the RNF212-like C. elegans protein ZHP-4 cooperates with the paralog of ZHPP-3 to enforce crossover formation in two distinct steps during meiotic prophase: formation of early JMs and transition of late CO intermediates to chiasmate. We show that zHP-3/4 localizes to the synaptonemal complex (SC) and co-dependently followed restriction sites to designated COs. We also show that ZHP is required to stabilize pro-crossover factors in the late crossover intermediate, in turn required for transition of bivalents required for bivalent remodelling. Our study reveals an essential requirement for ZHP in negotiating the formation of COs and their ability to transition structures capable of directing accurate chromosome segregation."

In contrast to the anticipated minimal, or perhaps absent, role of Nlrp3 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary tularemia, we find that Nlrp3 is a host susceptibility factor. Likely through promoting necrotic/necroptotic cell death, Nlrp3 contributes to the immature myeloid response and necrotic pathology that characterize lethal infection with Francisella tularensis.","Francisella tularensis (Ft) causes frequently fatal, acute necrotic pneumonia in humans and animals.

Phylogenetic analyses support a model where the gene has been “dead” for at least 25 million years of human primate evolution but whose ORF became restored in all human and great ape lineages. We suggest that the rebirth or restoration of the gene coincided with the insertion of an endogenous retrovirus, which now serves as the functional promoter driving human gene expression.

The use of monthly pentamidine infusion for those with lower CD4 counts (<200 cells/μL) at the time of VL cure appeared to result in a comparable relapse-free survival rate to those patients with higher CD4 count (≥200 cells/μL) who did not receive secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, patients with a history of previous VL treatment (VL relapse) remained at high risk of relapse despite achieving CD4 count ≥200 cells/μL at the end of the VL treatment. While all VL patients with HIV co-infection may benefit from secondary prophylaxis, those with CD4 <200 cells/μL and previous history of treatment should be prioritized for secondary prophylaxis.

Protein coding sequences have traditionally been the focus of these studies, as the genetic code enables a detailed study of the strength of selection acting on amino acid sequences. However, from the earliest cross-species sequence comparisons, it was clear that protein sequences among closely related species are too similar to explain the observed phenotypic diversity. This led to the hypothesis that the evolution of gene regulation has played a key role in generating diversity between species. The availability of numerous complete genome sequences has made it possible to begin testing this hypothesis. In this work, the authors use an evolutionary model to identify functional divergence within transcription factor binding sites, the core functional elements involved in gene regulation. Applying this model to the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its three closest relatives, the authors find that a substantial fraction of the ancestral binding sites have been lost in a species-specific manner. In some cases the loss of the binding site creates gene expression differences that may be indicative of species-specific changes in gene regulation. This work provides a useful computational framework that will allow further study of the conservation of cis-regulatory sequences and their role in molecular evolution.","Cis-regulatory sequences are conserved in many species. However, the evolution of species-specific patterns of gene expression depends on the flexible nature of the regulatory code. We developed an evolutionary model to detect the loss of constraint of individual transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). We find that a significant fraction of functionally constrained binding sites are lost in a lineage-specific manner in closely related yeast species. We estimate that nearly half of these loss events are explained by binding site turnover. Recreating mutations that led to binding site loss confirms sequence changes that affect gene expression cases. We also estimate that the high rate of binding site gain, half of the experimentally identified S. cerevisiae binding sites, is due to turnover. The frequent gain loss of TFBSs implies that cis-regulation sequences are labile in absence of turnover, which may contribute to species-wide patterns in gene expression."

Overall , identified aphid salivary proteins share features plant pathogen effectors function aphid effectors perturbing host cellular processes .","Aphids are insects that can induce feeding damage, achieve high population densities, and most importantly, transmit economically important plant diseases worldwide. To develop durable approaches to control aphids, it is critical to understand how aphids interact with plants at the molecular level. Aphid feeding induces plant defenses, which can be suppressed by aphid saliva. Thus, aphids can alter plant cellular processes to promote infestation of plants. Suppression of plant defenses is common in plant pathogens and involves secretion of effector proteins that modulate host cell processes. Evidence suggests that aphids, like plant pathogens, deliver effectors inside their host cells to promote infestation. However, the identity of these effectors and their functions remain elusive. Here, we report a novel approach based on a combination of bioinformatics and functional assays to identify candidate effectors from the aphid species Myzus persicae. Using this approach, we identified three candidate effectors that affect plant defense responses and/or aphid reproductive performance. Further characterization of these candidates promises to reveal new insights into the plant cellular processes targeted by aphids.","Aphids are devastating sap-feeding insects in plants. Like plant parasites, aphids require intimate associations with host plants to gain access to nutrients. Aphid feeding induces responses to clogging of phloem sieve elements and callose formation, which are suppressed by unknown molecules, probably proteins, in aphid saliva. It is likely that aphids, like plant pathogens, deliver proteins (effectors) inside hosts to modulate host cell processes, suppress plant defenses, and promote infestation. We exploited a publicly available aphid salivary gland expressed sequence tags ( ESTs) to apply functional genomics to identify candidate effectors for Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) based on common features of plant pathogen effectors. A total of 48 effector candidates were identified, cloned, and subjected to transient overexpression of Nicotiana benthamiana assay elicitation phenotype, suppression of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP)–mediated oxidative burst, and effects on aphid reproductive performance. We identified a candidate effector, Mp10, that specifically induced chlorosis and local cell death in N. tabacum and conferred avirulence in recombinant Potato virus X (PVX-Mp10), which was associated with plant defenses. Our results suggest that Mp 10 suppresses flg22- triggered immunity, triggers a defense response, and results in an overall decrease of aphid performance in fecundity assays."

Molecular properties control the function of a cell, while cell ensembles form tissues and organs, which work together as an organism. In order to understand and characterize the molecular nature of the emergent properties of a cell, it is essential that multiple components of the cell are measured simultaneously in the same cell. Similarly, multiple cells must be measured in order to understand health and disease in the organism. In this work, we develop an approach that is able to determine how many cells, how many measurements per cell, and which measurements are needed to reliably diagnose disease. We apply this method to two different problems: the diagnosis of a premature aging disorder using images of cell nuclei, and the distinction between two similar autoimmune eye diseases using stained cells from patients' blood samples. Our findings shed new light on the role of specific kinds of immune system cells in systemic inflammatory diseases and may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.","Cell heterogeneity and the interplay of multiple molecular processes within a cell pose difficult challenges to current single-cell biology. We introduce a new approach to identify disease phenotype using multiparameter single cell measurements, based on the concept of “supercell statistics”, which is a multi-cell-based averaging procedure followed by a machine learning classification scheme. We were able to assess the optimal tradeoff between number of single cells and the number of measurements needed to capture phenotypic differences between healthy and diseased patients, but different diseases are difficult to diagnose. We apply this approach to different kinds of single-cells datasets, addressing the diagnosis of premature aging disorder and images of cell nuclei, phenotypes of non-infectious uveitides (Ocular manifestations of Behçet disease and sarcoidosis) based on multicolor flow cytometry. In each case, nuclear shape measurement taken from a group of 30 cells was sufficient to classify samples of healthy diseased, in agreement with usual laboratory practice. We are able to identify a minimal set of 5 markers that can accurately predict Behçets disease or sarcoids. This is the first time that quantitative phenotypicity distinction between diseases is achieved."

QS is essential for virulence and biofilm formation in many bacteria including the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa has high clinical relevance because it has acquired resistance to commonly used antibiotics, and is a priority pathogen on the CDC ESKAPE pathogen list. The urgent need for new antimicrobials to combat P. aeruginosa infections makes targeting QS for interference an attractive approach. Here, we investigate P. aeruginosa under biofilm conditions that mimic authentic P. aeruginosa lifestyles in environmental and medical contexts rather than in traditional laboratory conditions. This strategy enabled us to find that P. aeruginosa uses a novel QS signal molecule that controls biofilm formation and virulence. The new signal molecule acts together with the long-known QS receptor RhlR. Using physiologic, genetic, and molecular studies, combined with animal models of infection, we characterize the roles of QS components in biofilm formation and virulence. We find that RhlR and the putative new signal molecule are crucial for both traits. Our work suggests that targeting RhlR with small molecule inhibitors could provide an exciting path forward for the development of novel antimicrobials.","Quorum sensing (QS) is a bacterial cell-to-cell communication process that relies on the production, release, and response of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers.

However, RSV is often not the only detectable pathogen, but co-infections with respiratory bacteria are common. It has been hypothesized that this results from epithelial damage caused by the virus, facilitating colonization by pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, an inverse order of events is not impossible: bacterial infections may activate respiratory epithelial cells through TLR signaling, resulting in increased susceptibility to virus infections. We tested this hypothesis by screening bacterial TLR agonists for their capacity to modulate RSV infection in different cell types, and identified the lipopeptide and prototype TLR1/2 agonist Pam3CSK4 as an enhancer of RSV infections. However, to our surprise this proved independent of TLR activation, but was mediated by enhancement of binding between virus and target cell. Two structurally related lipopeptides unable to stimulate TLR responses were identified that enhanced infections with RSV, but also with other enveloped viruses including HIV-1, human metapneumovirus, and measles virus.

One major approach to this problem is to study where these transcription factors bind in the genome, but this does not tell us about the effect of that binding on gene expression levels and it is generally accepted that much of the binding does not strongly influence gene expression. To address this issue, we artificially reduced the concentration of 59 different transcription factors in the cell and then examined which genes were impacted by the reduced transcription factor level. Our results implicate some attributes that might influence what binding is functional, but they also suggest that a simple model of functional vs. non-functional binding may not suffice.","Genome-wide expression of genes is regulated by a number of regulatory elements, including transcription factors (TFs) and DNA regulatory elements. However, the regulatory logic underlying functional transcription factor binding is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the context of functional TF binding at 59 TFs and chromatin modifiers in the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line. We identified genes expression affected by knockdown of a transcription factor. We intersected gene expression data with transcription factor and binding data (based on ChIP-seq and DNase-seq) and 10 kb transcription start sites expressed in genes. We found that a small subset of genes are differentially expressed following a knockdown factor, suggesting that interactions with TF chromatin result in measurable changes in gene expression levels and putative target genes. Our results suggest that functional TF is enriched with regulatory elements that harbor a large number of TF binding sites, sites predicted to have higher binding affinity, and sites enriched with genomic regions annotated as “active enhancers.”"

At the cellular level, the mammalian clockwork consists of a core Per/Cry negative feedback loop and additional interlocking loops. We wished to address experimentally the contribution of the interlocking Bmal1 loop to clock function in mammals. Because behavioral rhythms do not always reflect cell-autonomous phenotypes and are subject to pleiotropic effects, we employed cell-based genetic approaches and monitored rhythms longitudinally using bioluminescent reporters of clock gene expression. We showed that REV-ERB repressors play a more prominent role than ROR activators in regulating the Bmal1 rhythm. However, significant rhythmicity remains even with constitutive expression of Bmal1, pointing to the resilience of the core loop to perturbations of the Bmal1 loop. We conclude that while the interlocking loop contributes to fine-tuning of the core loop, its primary function is to provide discrete waveforms of clock gene expression for control of local physiology. This study has important general implications not only for circadian biology across species, but also for the emerging field of systems biology that seeks to understand complex interactions in genetic networks.","Circadian clockwork is composed of a core/CRY feedback loop and additional interlocking loops. In particular, the ROR/REV/Bmal1 loop, consisting of ROR activators and REV-ERB repressors, is thought to “ stabilize” core clock function. However, functional redundancy and pleiotropic effects of gene deletions, the role of the REV/ERBα β function, have not been accurately defined. In this study, we examined cell-autonomous circadian oscillations combined with gene knockout and RNA interference and demonstrated that REV–ERBβ function is functionally redundant and is required for rhythmic Bmal1 expression. In contrast, RORs contribute to the amplitude and dispensable Bmal 1 rhythmicity. Our results provide direct in vivo genetic evidence that the REVs-ERBs play a prominent role in the combinatorial regulation of Cry1 Rorc expression, leading to phase-delay relative to Rev-erbα. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cellular genetic approach permitted testing the robustness of intracellular core clock functions."

The 2013–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most devastating Ebola outbreak to date resulting in over 28,600 identified human cases and 11,300 deaths. Though our knowledge of virus transmission is incomplete, we do know that transmission occurs through direct contact with virus-contaminated body fluids (blood, secretions, or other body fluids), materials such as bedding contaminated with these fluids, and through the handling and preparation of contaminated food. Asymptomatic Ebola virus infections that result in seroconversion in the absence of disease symptoms have been observed both in humans and experimentally in animal models. In the present serology study, we determined a majority of Ebola survivors in our cohort had measurable antibody levels against at least one viral antigen, as expected. In our cohort of close contacts, relatives and health care workers who took care of Ebola-infected individuals during the outbreak, we observed a rate of seroprevalence of 12.7% as indicated by detectable GP antibody levels. Given that Ebola virus is typically associated with a highly lethal disease in humans, it is of great interest to determine the host-virus interactions and transmission dynamics associated with asymptomatic cases.","The 2013–2016 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa was the largest and deadliest outbreak to date.

The generation of these oscillations has so far only been investigated in generic one- and two-population networks, neglecting their embedment into larger systems. We introduce a method that determines the mechanisms and sub-circuits generating oscillations in structured spiking networks. Analyzing a multi-layered model of the cortical microcircuit, we trace back characteristic oscillations to experimentally observed connectivity patterns. The approach exposes the influence of individual connections on frequency and amplitude of these oscillations and therefore reveals locations, where biological mechanisms controlling oscillations and experimental manipulations have the largest impact. The new analytical tool replaces parameter scans in computationally expensive models, guides circuit design, and can be employed to validate connectivity data.","Oscillations are omnipresent in neural population signals, like multi-unit recordings, EEG/MEG, and local field potential. These oscillations are linked to the population firing rate of neurons, individual neurons firing at close-to-regular fashion at low rates. A combination of mean-field and linear response theory can predict the spectra generated by a layered microcircuit model of V1, composed of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons based on connectivity compiled from anatomical electrophysiological studies. The model exhibits low- and high-γ oscillations in visible populations, but the origin of these oscillations can be deduced from spectra. We develop a universally applicable systematic approach to identify the anatomical circuits underlying the generation of oscillations. Based on the theoretical reduction of dynamics, we derive a sensitivity measure that identifies connections that are crucial for the peak amplitude frequency observed in oscillations and identifies a minimal circuit generating the given frequency. We show that low- γ peak turns are generated in a sub-circuit located in layer 2/3 4, while high-γ peak turns emerge in inter-neuron layer 4. Connections between layer 5 and layer 5 are found to regulate slow rate fluctuations. Our study uncovers connections that have a significant impact on population spectra, but impairment of connections leaves dynamics at the population level unaltered."

This exceptional radioresistance results from many features including efficient DNA double strand break repair. Here, we examine genome stability in D. radiodurans before and after exposure to ionizing radiation. Rearrangements between repeated sequences are a major source of genome instability and can be deleterious to the organism. Thus, we measured the frequency of recombination between direct repeats separated by intervening sequences of various lengths in the presence or absence of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks. Strikingly, we showed that the frequency of deletions was as high in strains devoid of the RecA, RecF or RecO proteins as in wild type bacteria, suggesting a very efficient RecA-independent process able to generate genome rearrangements. Our results suggest that single strand annealing may play a major role in genome instability in the absence of homologous recombination.","Bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is one of the most radioresistant organisms known.

The presence of mutations in the repeated sequence reduced, MutS-dependent, frequency of deletion events. We also show that distance repeats influence the frequencies of deletions events in recA+, and recO, and that the absence of the UvrD protein stimulated recombination in direct repeats and absence of DdrB protein, previously shown to be involved in DNA double strand break repair and the single strand annealing (SSA) pathway, strongly reduces frequency of RecA- (RecO-) independent deletions and events in cells devoid of the RecA or RecO protein."

Since both populations are active at the same time, space information has to be synchronized between the two. Both brain areas are reciprocally connected, and it is unclear how the two codes influence each other. In this paper, we analyze a theoretical model of how a place code processes inputs from the grid cell population. The model shows that the sparseness of the place code poses a much stronger constraint than maximal information transfer. We thus conclude that the potentially high spatial acuity of the grid code cannot be efficiently conveyed to a sparse place cell population and thus propose that sparseness and spatial acuity are two independent objectives of the neuronal place representation.","Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex encode space firing fields arranged on spatial hexagonal lattices. The spatial acuity of grid cells is determined by their capacity to transmit space information to place cells. In this paper, we investigate how grid cells encode space information in place cells by providing feed-forward input from place cells to the hippocampus. We find that the capacity of the grid cells to encode spatial information is dependent on the number of different spatial environments represented. We also find that spatial encoding of place code can be resilient to multiple remappings of place fields. We conclude that the spatial decoding of place information by grid cells can be robust to multiple spatial environments."

Unfortunately, albendazole, the drug most commonly used for the control of the other STH (hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura) has little effect on Ss. The drug of choice, ivermectin, has been extensively used in mass drug administration (MDA) for the filarial worms Onchocerca volvulus and Wuchereria bancrofti. In the province of Esmeraldas, in Ecuador, we studied Ss (and other STH) prevalence from 1990 (prior to MDA initiation) to 2013 (6 years after MDA cessation) in rural communities where MDA was regularly executed for onchocerciasis compared with neighboring communities where ivermectin was not distributed because onchocerciasis was not present. Ss prevalence remained high over the years in the areas with no MDA, while in those with MDA prevalence fell to zero, and remained very low 6 years after MDA cessation. A less important effect was observed for T. trichiura. Adding ivermectin to MDA programs for STH would importantly contribute to the control of Ss infection.","Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. In Ecuador, ivermectin is used as a mass drug for the control of onchocerciasis. We conducted retrospective analysis of data collected from five surveys conducted in the Esmeraldas (Ecuador) region between 1990 and 2013. We found that the prevalence of the parasite T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides hookworms was significantly reduced in the areas covered by the drug. We also found that in areas where the drug was distributed, the prevalence was significantly lower than in areas that were not covered. This suggests that the drug may have a significant impact on the prevalence and pathogenicity of the parasitic worm, trichuriasis."

In order to gain more insight into the ultrastructure of the prototype FV (PFV) we performed (cryo-)electron tomography and microscopy of infected cells and of isolated virions. We find that PFV contains a nucleocapsid of constant dimensions at its center, an intermediate shell of protein positioned between the core capsid and the viral membrane and glycoprotein that arranges into regular hexagonal lattices on the virus membrane. Structural analysis of the glycoprotein was performed in situ to a resolution of 9Å, which shows regular helical features such as a trimeric coiled coil of the fusion protein subunit, a hallmark of class I fusion proteins, spacer arms between the glycoprotein trimers and the arrangement of six transmembrane helices, a characteristic feature of the PFV Env glycoprotein. We discuss our results in light of the evolutionary relationship of PFV with other retroviruses as well as the role of the unique glycoprotein architecture on the virus life cycle.","Foamy viruses (FV) belong to the genus Spumavirus, which forms a distinct lineage of the Retroviridae family.

Mature PFV particles have a distinct morphology with a capsid constant dimension ordered by shell density. The capsid membrane is likely formed by the Gag N-terminal domain of the cytoplasmic Env leader peptide gp18LP. The viral membrane contains trimeric Env glycoproteins partly arranged in interlocked hexagonal assemblies. In situ 3D reconstruction of a subtomogram averaging wild type Env Env gp48TM-gp80SU cleavage site mutant showed similar spike architecture, stabilization of hexagonal lattice and clear connections between lower and higher densities of neighboring trimers.

Many of these cases could be easily prevented if sufficiently advanced warning was available. This is the main goal of epidemiological forecasting, a relatively new field that attempts to predict when and where disease outbreaks will occur. In response to growing interest in this endeavor, many forecasting frameworks have been developed for a variety of diseases. We ask whether an approach based on collective human judgment can be used to produce reasonable forecasts and how such forecasts compare with forecasts produced by purely data-driven systems. To answer this, we collected simple predictions in real-time from a set of expert and non-expert volunteers during the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 U.S. flu seasons and during the 2014–2015 chikungunya invasion of Central America, and we report several measures of accuracy based on these predictions. By comparing these predictions with published forecasts of data-driven methods, we build an intuition for the difficulty of the task and learn that there is real value in collective human judgment.","Infectious diseases impose a considerable burden on society, despite significant advances in technology and medicine over the past century.

Earlier studies only focus on individual genetic variants. However, studies on disease mechanisms suggest the aggregation of genomic variants may contribute to diseases. For this reason, researchers commonly use prior biological knowledge to identify genetic variants that are functionally related. However, these approaches are often limited to variants that are in the coding regions of genes. However, several risk variants are in the regulatory region. Here, we incorporate known regulatory and functional interactions to find sets of genetic variants which are informative features for risk assessment.

One such oncogenic tyrosine kinase is FAK, which is known to regulate cellular signalling downstream of Integrins and Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK) at the cell surface. In this study, however, we report that FAK can act as a suppressor of oncogenic Receptor Tyrosine Kinases. This mechanism was observed in fruit fly tissues in vivo and human cancer-derived cells in vitro, which additionally suggests it is an evolutionary conserved mechanism in humans. FAK mediated this inhibition by controlling the sub-cellular localisation of receptors, via suppression of receptor recycling to the cell surface. These results suggest that in some particular cancer contexts such as RTK-driven tumours, FAK may act as a tumour suppressor and therefore, may not be a valid drug target.","Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) regulate multiple signalling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Although FAK interacts with RTKs, little is known about how FAK regulates downstream signalling. Here, we investigated FAK-mediated negative regulation of RTK/MAPK signalling in Drosophila melanogaster epithelia by impairing the MAPK pathway in human breast cancer cells, suggesting a conserved phenomenon in humans. Mechanistically, FAK reduced receptor recycling from the plasma membrane, resulted in lower MAPK activation. Conversely, increasing the membrane pool of the receptor increased MAPK signaling. FAK is widely considered to be a therapeutic target in cancer biology; however, its tumour suppressor properties are not well understood in other therapeutic contexts. Therefore, our study provides new insights into the role of FAK in RTK and MAPK signalling and suggests potential implications for designing therapy strategies for RTK-driven tumours."

Further analysis of the chromosomal sequences associated with the associated HLA alleles allowed us to refine the mapping of the susceptibility variants.

Presented here are simulation results showing that polyproline II propensities from short peptides accurately describe sequence-dependent variability in the hydrodynamic dimensions of intrinsically disordered proteins. Good agreement was observed from a simple molecular model even when charge-based considerations were ignored, predicting that global organization of disordered protein structure is strongly dependent on intrinsic conformational propensities and, for many intrinsically disordered proteins, modulated only weakly by coulombic effects.","Polyproline II (PPII) is a polyproline-II structure that is thought to depend on intrinsic conformational propensities of polyprolines II.

In this study, we show that the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) predicted for experimental PPII propenities in good agreement, with charge-based considerations omitted. Our simulations demonstrate that the Rh chain propensity for PPII structure is linked to a simple power-law scaling relationship, and that the charge effects of Rh are generally weak compared to the PPII effects on Rh.

Using DNA immunization we investigated the immune response induced by abundant proteins within the saliva of the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi. We found that one salivary protein protected while another exacerbated L. major infection, suggesting that the type of immune response induced by specific salivary proteins can prime and direct anti-Leishmania immunity. This stresses the importance of the proper selection of vector-based vaccine candidates. This work validates the powerful protection that can be acquired through vaccination with the appropriate salivary molecule and more importantly, shows that this protective immune response is efficiently recalled by sand fly bites, the natural route of transmission.","Leishmania parasites are transmitted in the presence of sand fly saliva.

A central function of circadian clocks is controlling the adaptive response to the daily cycle of light and darkness. As such, altering the clock (e.g., by jet lag or shiftwork) affects mental and physical health in humans. It has generally been thought that the underlying molecular mechanism of circadian oscillations is an autoregulatory transcriptional/translational feedback loop. However, in cyanobacteria, only three purified clock proteins can reconstitute a circadian rhythm of protein phosphorylation in a test tube (in vitro). Using this in vitro system we found that the three proteins interact to form complexes of different compositions throughout the cycle. We derived a dynamic model for the in vitro oscillator that accurately reproduces the rhythms of complexes and of protein phosphorylation. One of the proteins undergoes phase-dependent exchange of its monomers, and the model demonstrates that this monomer exchange allows the maintenance of robust oscillations. Finally, we perturbed the in vitro oscillator with temperature pulses to demonstrate the resetting characteristics of this unique circadian oscillator. Our study analyzes a circadian clockwork to an unprecedented level of molecular detail.","The circadian clockwork is a complex of proteins that are composed of a number of proteins, each of which is regulated by a specific molecular mechanism.

We derive a dynamic model of the in vitro oscillator that accurately reproduces the rhythms of KaiA and KaiB complexes and KaiC phosphorylation, consistent with biophysical observations of individual Kai protein interactions. We use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to confirm that monomer exchange between KaiC and hexamers occurs, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. Finally, we apply perturbation analyses to test the resetting characteristics of the KaiABC oscillator, testing resetting properties of the unique circadian oscillator."

Through the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE), we had the opportunity to compare the impact of school-based treatment in an area of western Kenya with moderate (10%-24%) initial prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infections. We found that providing MDA every year or every other year over a 4 year period provided similar benefits for reducing prevalence and intensity of infection in the final evaluation at year 5. Annual or biennial MDA moved villages from the “moderate risk” to the “low risk category” prescribed in the WHO guidelines.

The disease is transmitted by the bite of the parasite, which is transmitted to the host by the bites of the infected host. The treatment of schistosomes with praziquantel is recommended for the control of the disease. However, studies have not compared the impact of different schedules of MDA on the resultant infection levels. We wished to evaluate whether annual MDA is effective at reducing the community-level prevalence intensity of S. mansoni infections.

Previous work has shown that Toxoplasma hijacks the migratory machinery of dendritic cells by inducing secretion of the neurotransmitter GABA and by activating GABAergic signaling pathways, thereby making infected dendritic cells hypermigratory in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that the signaling molecule calcium plays a central role for this migratory activation and that signal transduction is preferentially mediated through a subtype of voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav1.3). This study functionally implicates Cav1.3 channels in a, hitherto uncharacterized, calcium signaling axis by which dendritic cells are induced to become migratory. The studies show how an obligate intracellular pathogen takes advantage of non-canonical signaling pathways in immune cells to modulate their migratory properties, and thereby facilitate the dissemination of the parasite.","The intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii exploits cells of the immune system to disseminate and disseminate.

As a cell survival protein and key regulator of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), BAG3 sequesters EBOV and MARV VP40 away from the site of budding at the plasma membrane, and thus may represent a novel host defense strategy to combat filovirus VP40-mediated egress and spread.","Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) viruses are members of the Filoviridae family and cause outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever. The filovirus VP40 matrix protein is essential for virus assembly and budding. The PPxY L-domain motif interacts with the WW-domain specific host proteins, Nedd4 and ITCH, to facilitate late stage virus-cell separation. In this study, we identify additional proteins that interact with VP40, including BCL2 Associated Athanogene 3 (BAG3). BAG3 is a member of the BAG family of molecular chaperone proteins, and is a specific VP40 PPXY interactor.

When errors of prediction occur, models must be updated to ensure desired outcomes are still achieved. Neuromodulator chemicals provide a possible pathway for triggering such changes in brain state. One such neuromodulator, noradrenaline, originates predominantly from a cluster of neurons in the brainstem—the locus coeruleus (LC)—and plays a key role in behaviour, for instance, in determining the balance between exploiting or exploring the environment. Here we use Active Inference (AI), a mathematical model of perception and action, to formally describe LC function. We propose that LC activity is triggered by errors in prediction and that the subsequent release of noradrenaline alters the rate of learning about the environment. Biologically, this describes an LC-cortex feedback loop promoting behavioural flexibility in times of uncertainty. We model LC output as a simulated animal performs two tasks known to elicit archetypal responses. We find that experimentally observed ‘phasic’ and ‘tonic’ patterns of LC activity emerge naturally, and that modulation of learning rates improves task performance. This provides a simple, unified computational account of noradrenergic computational function within a general model of behaviour.","The locus coeruleus (LC) pons are a major source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. The modes of LC firing are associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses evoked salient stimuli. Here, we unify the modes of firing in the response to LC to correlate with prediction error inferring states of action planning in Active Inference (AI). We simulate a classic/reward learning task-arm ‘explore/ exploit’ task, in which LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level ‘state-action’ prediction errors, whilst the tonic and phasics of LC activity reflect emergent features of belief and updating. We demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents update internal models quickly feeding the state-action prediction error – reflected by LC firing and noradsrenaline release – to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments in short timescales. We propose that prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from the LC cortex modulates belief updating in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In short, we characterise the LC/NA system as a general theory of brain function."

We combine these genomic and transcriptomic data to predict variation in plant height, and we use quantitative genetics to mechanistically connect plant genetics, transcriptomics, and development. Our approach demonstrates two powerful methods for the type of data reduction (FVT modeling and gene expression network reconstruction for targeted eQTL analyses) and data integration that will be necessary for driving forward the field of genetics in the post-genomic era. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply these techniques to continuous models of plant development, and the first to do so in agroecologically relevant field settings.","Plant developmental dynamics are heritable, genetically correlated with fitness and yield, and undergo selection.

To understand how they achieve that, we need to study their mechanisms. Computational enzymology can show us what happens in the enzyme’s active site during a reaction. But molecules need first to reach the active site before a reaction can start. The process of substrate entry and product exit to the active site is often neglected when studying enzymes. However, these two events are of fundamental importance to the proper functioning of any enzyme. We are interested in these dynamic processes to complete our understanding of the mode of action of enzymes. In our work, we have studied substrate and product migration in vanillyl alcohol oxidase. This enzyme can produce the flavour vanillin and enantiopure alcohols, but also catalyses other reactions. The named products are of interest to the flavour- and fine-chemical industries.","Vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) is a homo-octameric flavoenzyme belonging to the VAO/PCMH family. VAO catalyses, reactions, and-step conversion of p- creosol (2-methyloxy-4-methylphenol) and vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-moxybenzaldehyde). To elucidate the different ligands that enter and exit the secluded active site, Monte Carlo based simulations were performed. The entry/exit path of VAO is the most likely route of ligands. The fourth path leading to FAD is found in co-ligands with dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Based on the binding energies and behaviour of the ligands paths, we propose sequence events of ligand co-ligand migration and catalysis. We identified two residues, His466 and Tyr503, which act as concierges at the active site of phenolic ligands, and residues, Tyr51 and Tyr408, act as gateway for FAD and diooxygen. These residues are present in VAO closest relatives, eugenol oxidase and p-cresol methylhydroxylase. The key path residues movements in simulations correspond to conformations observed in crystal structures of enzymes. The preservation of path residues is linked to electron acceptor specificity and oligomerisation of state enzymes. This study provides a proof concept for the use of an unbiased method to sample the sample process."

In the biological sciences hierarchical clustering has achieved a position of pre-eminence due to its ability to capture multiple levels of data granularity. Hierarchical clustering’s visual displays of phylogenetic trees and gene-expression modules are indeed seductive. Despite its merits, hierarchical clustering is greedy by nature and often produces spurious clusters, particularly in the presence of substantial noise. This paper presents a relatively new alternative to hierarchical clustering known as convex clustering. Although convex clustering is more computationally demanding, it enjoys several advantages over hierarchical clustering and other traditional methods of clustering. Convex clustering delivers a uniquely defined clustering path that partially obviates the need for choosing an optimal number of clusters. Along the path small clusters gradually coalesce to form larger clusters. Clustering can be guided by external information through appropriately defined similarity weights. Comparisons to hierarchical clustering demonstrate the superior robustness of convex clustering to noise. Our genetics examples include inference of the demographic history of 52 populations across the world, a more detailed analysis of European demography, and a re-analysis of a well-known breast cancer expression dataset. We also introduce a new algorithm for solving the convex clustering problem. This algorithm belongs to a subclass of MM (minimization-majorization) algorithms known as proximal distance algorithms. The proximal distance convex clustering algorithm is inherently parallelizable and readily maps to modern many-core devices such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Our freely available software, convexcluster, exploits OpenCL routines that ensure compatibility across a variety of hardware environments.","The primary goal of cluster analysis is to discover natural groupings of objects. However, the field of clustering is crowded with diverse methods and special assumptions about data address different scientific aims. Despite its accuracy, hierarchical clustering remains the dominant clustering method in bioinformatics. Biologists find trees constructed by hierarchical clusters visually appealing in the tune of evolutionary perspective. Hierarchical clustering operates on multiple scales simultaneously. We are interested in making qualitative inferences that lead to higher-order relationships like pathways of biological processes. We have recently developed a method for convex clustering that preserves the visual appeal and reduces the propensity of false inferences in the presence of outliers of noise. The solution paths generated by convex clusters reveal relationships between clusters hidden by static methods of k-threshold clustering. Our current paper derives tests for a novel proximal distance algorithm that is minimizing the objective function of convex and supports prior information relationships.

We present the experience of a Tropical Medicine Unit in a major European city, over a 19-year period, describing and comparing NTDs diagnosed amongst immigrants, travelers and travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs). NTDs were diagnosed outside tropical areas and occurred more frequently in immigrants, followed by VFR travelers and then by other travelers.

Issues focusing on modes of transmission outside endemic areas and how eradication programs for some NTDs in endemic countries may have an impact in non-tropical Western countries by decreasing disease burden in immigrants, are addressed.

A mismatch in the helix is recognized by MutS homologs and subsequent events include excision of the error-containing strand followed by re-synthesis. A critical step in this process is directing repair to the newly synthesized strand. Current data suggest that transient discontinuities in the DNA backbone, known as nicks, generated during replication serve as the strand discrimination signals. Additionally, proteins that package DNA have the capacity to block mismatch recognition and are known to rapidly assemble behind the replication fork. Thus, there must be a short window of opportunity for the mismatch recognition complexes to scan for mismatches and access the strand discrimination signals. To address these issues, we tested the model that the mismatch recognition complexes track with the replisome. We employed high resolution genomic methods to determine that during replication, the mismatch recognition complexes bind origins of replication and advances with the replisome. The findings support the hypothesis that the mismatch recognition proteins track with the DNA replication machinery to accurately survey and repair the newly synthesized strands while the DNA is unpackaged and strand specificity signals are accessible.","During replication, mismatch repair proteins recognize the repair of mispaired bases and escape proofreading activity of the DNA polymerase. In this work, we tested a model of eukaryotic mismatch recognition complex that tracks the advancing replication of the replisome. In yeast, we examined the dynamics of the replication leading strand polymerase Polε Pol2, an invariant protein involved in mismatch recognition. Specifically, synchronized cells processed samples of chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with custom DNA tiling arrays (ChIP-chip). We found that the Polε signal was detectable in G1, observed active origins replicating in the DNA S-phase. We also observed that Msh2 binds to the origins of replicating regions and spreads to adjacent regions of replisomes. Our data support the model of proximity to the MutSα/β replication complex to efficiently repair newly synthesized strand chromatin and reassembles."

Curiously, approximately 10% of protein kinases lack one or more catalytic residues, and these kinases have been termed pseudokinases. It has been proposed that some pseudokinases act as scaffolds, bringing together proteins involved in signalling networks. Here, we report the structure of the pseudokinase STRADα in complex with the adaptor protein MO25α; together these two proteins regulate the LKB1 tumour suppressor kinase. Despite lacking several key catalytic residues, STRADα binds ATP and adopts an active conformation typical of catalytically competent kinases. The affinity of STRADα for ATP is enhanced by MO25α and vice versa. We go on to demonstrate through mutagenesis studies that binding to both ATP and MO25α is essential for the activation of LKB1. Our data suggest that STRADα exerts its functions through an active conformation, not through actual catalytic activity, thus raising the possibility that pseudokinases regulate signalling networks by adopting different structural conformations.","Pseudokinases lack essential residues of kinase activity, emerging as important regulators of signal transduction networks. The pseudokinase STRAD activates LKB1, a tumour suppressor, by forming a heterotrimeric complex with its scaffolding protein MO25. Here, we describe the structure of STRADα complex with MO25α. The structure reveals intricate web interactions between STRAD and MO25β involving the αC-helix of STRadα, reminiscent of the mechanism by which CDK2 interacts with cyclin A. Surprisingly, STRADβ binds to ATP and displays a closed conformation with an ordered activation loop, typical of active protein kinases. Inactivity accounted for nonconservative substitution of essential catalytic residues. We demonstrate that binding to ATP enhances the affinity of the protein to the protein, and that ATP enhances its interaction with STRADδ. Mutagenesis studies reveal that the association between the protein and ATP is essential for the activation of the ligand-binding complex. Our findings suggest that the function of the pseudokinases is mediated by the active kinase conformation."

However, some common traits, such as cancer, can result from a minority of cells that adopted a special behavior. From one individual to another, DNA variants can modify the frequency of such cellular behaviors. The body of one of the individuals then harbours more misbehaving cells and is therefore predisposed to a macroscopic phenotypic change, such as disease. Such genetic effects are probabilistic, they contribute little to trait variation at the macroscopic level and therefore largely escape detection in classical studies. We have developed a novel statistical method that uses single-cell measurements to detect variants of the genome that have non-deterministic effects on cellular traits. The approach is based on a comparison of distributions of single-cell traits. We applied it to colonies of yeast cells and showed that it can detect mutations that change cellular morphology or molecular regulations in a probabilistic manner. This opens the way to study multicellular organisms from a novel angle, by exploiting single-cell technologies to detect genetic variants that predispose to certain diseases or common traits.","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an important tool for the study of genetic variation. However, the statistical power of GWAS is limited by the statistical-power issue: polymorphisms contribute little to common trait variation and escape detection. This small contribution corresponds to incomplete penetrance, which can result in probabilistic effects of molecular regulations. In some cases, genetic mapping can benefit from wealth of data produced by single-cell technologies. Here, we present a novel genetic mapping method that allows us to scan the genomes of single cells and modify statistical properties of cellular-level quantitative traits. We show that this method can be exploited to improve genetic dissection of certain common traits. The method is available as an open source R package called ptlmapper."

Cellular adaptation to stress is essential to ensure organismal survival, and NRF2 is an exceptionally well-studied and key determinant of cellular stress responses that plays complex roles in cancer biology and responses to xenobiotics, including chemotherapies. Our studies have established a functional and evolutionarily conserved role for WDR23 as a substrate receptor for the Cullin4(CUL4)-DDB1 E3-ubiquitin ligase, which regulates NRF2 protein levels and activity, and which operates independently of the canonical KEAP1-CUL3 pathway. KEAP1 has been the most highly studied regulator of NRF2, as mutations in KEAP1, which result in uncontrolled activation of NRF2 and chemo-resistance, are found in many aggressive cancers. Importantly, increased expression of WDR23 in KEAP1(-/-) cancer cells restores aberrant NRF2 regulation. In the absence of a KEAP1-like system, C. elegans WDR-23 has been shown to regulate the worm cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1. We have leveraged C. elegans genetic approaches to identify conserved regulatory mechanisms of mammalian cytoprotection by NRF2. Collectively, our studies suggest control of NRF2 homeostasis is much more sophisticated than previously appreciated.","Cellular adaptation to stress is essential to ensure organismal survival. NRF2/NFE2L2 is a key determinant of xenobiotic stress responses, but loss of negative regulation of the KEAP1-CUL3 proteasome system has been implicated in chemo- and radiation-resistant cancers. Here, we identify a new WDR23-DDB1-CCUL4 regulatory axis that regulates NRF1 activity and cytoprotection independently of the canonical KEAP3 system. We show that WDR3 binds to the DIDLID sequence of the Neh2 domain and regulates stability; its regulation is dependent on the binding of DLG and ETGE motifs. In addition, we show that the C-terminal domain is highly conserved and is involved in the regulation of NRF3 and the DDB1 and CUL4 complex. These results reveal a cellular pathway that regulates the activity of NFE2 and the capacity of the NRFs2/NCF2 proteasomes to interact with and regulate cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs."

The absence of vaccines or prophylactic drugs for most of these diseases emphasizes the need for accurate sampling of mosquito vector populations and testing for arboviruses. Accurate surveillance is crucial for early warning of potential or assessing mitigation of existing outbreaks. However, it is a challenge to sample mosquitoes in adequate numbers during the inter-epidemic periods (IEP) because this period is characterized by low mosquito population densities, sporadic transmission foci and low mosquito infection rates. Therefore more efficient tools are needed to increase capture rates so maximized virus detection probability in the mosquitoes can be achieved for assessing risk and outbreak predictions. This can be accomplished by exploiting the host-seeking behavior of adult female mosquitoes and the olfactory cues used to locate a potential host. Here, odors emanating from fur of sheep, a susceptible host for RVFV, is shown to improve trap capture rates of mosquito vectors of RVF in a standard surveillance trap. These data provide for future investigations to identify attractive components present in these natural odors, so that they can be incorporated into existing traps to serve as a population density-monitoring tool for improved arbovirus disease surveillance during IEP.","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arboviral disease transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods. The disease is transmitted by skin volatiles and fur sheep, known as preferred host mosquito vectors for Rift Valley fever. The standard CDC light trap (L), baited (LCF), CO2 (LC), and animal volatile (LF) traps are highly endemic areas of RVF in Kenya (Marigat and Ijara districts) from March–June September–December 2010. The incidence rate ratios (IRR) of mosquito species chose traps baited with LCF, LCF and LF instead of control (L) were estimated. Marigat dominated secondary vectors of host-seeking mosquitoes 3–4 times more likely to enter LC and LCF traps than the LCF trap [IRR = 3.1 and IRR   =  3.8 respectively] than the L trap. L trap captured a greater number of mosquitoes than LC trap, but the difference in the difference was significant. Analogous results were observed in IjARA, where mosquito species dominated the key primary primary primary RVFV vectors, and 1.6-, 6.5-, 8.5-, and 8-fold increases in trap captures were recorded in LF, LC, LC and L baited traps respectively, relative to control. The catches differed significantly in L trap compared to LCF. The difference in trap counts differed in the abundance of mosquitoes in LCF compared to the LC ( IRR =  1.63). Mosquito species composition and trap counts also differed in RVF sites. Identifying attractive components present in natural odors may lead to the development of an effective odor-bait trapping system and population density-monitoring as a result of improved RVF surveillance especially during the inter-epidemic period."

The animal hosts are thus considered reservoirs for human infection as livestock in Thailand usually live in close contact with householders in rural areas. However, the links of Leptospira serovars in humans and livestock in Thailand are poorly understood. Therefore, we illustrate the circulation of Leptospira serovars in humans and livestock during the past six years. The cross-correlations of the seroprevalence distribution were investigated to assess similarity between serovars across and within both, species and regions. The results suggest that livestock could be a potential source for human infection as sample analysis revealed a predominance of the same serovars. This information will increase public health awareness and may benefit especially high risk groups such as abattoir workers, livestock owners, farmers and other animal handling personal.","Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by infection with leptospires.

Recently, emergence of arboviral diseases caused by Zika and chikungunya viruses has also become a global concern. Knowledge about the ecology of mosquito populations under natural conditions may provide significant aid to help designing more effective vector control strategies. Quantitative metrics such as the abundance of mosquito populations are difficult to be measured in the field without resorting to experiments with markers. There are, however, limitations to these kinds of experiments such as short mosquito lifespan, marking limitations due to small body size, low efficiency in capturing devices such as traps, and once-only individual capture. Due to these limitations most methods estimate either only abundance or a combination of abundance and survivorship. In this work, we present statistical methods designed to estimate abundance, survivorship and recruitment using inference models and information such as counts of pupae. Results indicate that having low capture efficiencies as often observed in field assays still permits good estimation. Also, low number of released mosquitoes compromise density and survival estimations. We expect these methods to be helpful to people collecting mosquito field data and for health analysts to evaluate possible outcomes of control interventions.","Mosquitoes use mark-release-recapture (MRR) to capture and capture their prey. MRR protocols are often used to determine the abundance, survival, and recruitment of mosquito populations in the field. However, the limitations of mosquito MRR protocol include marking limitations, small individual size, short lifespan, low efficiency of capturing devices and traps, and individual removal from capture. These limitations usually limit MRR analysis to an abundance estimation in combination with abundance and survivorship, which can generate a great degree of uncertainty in estimations. Here, we present a set of Bayesian biodemographic models designed to fit data from common mosquito recapture experiments. We use these models to estimate the number of released individuals, survival rates, removal of individuals from capturing, and collection of pupae. Our models allow estimation of abundance, survivorship of marked and unmarked mosquitoes, as well as capture efficiency and recruitment rate. We analyze the accuracy of estimates of varying number released individuals and the abundance of survivorship and capture efficiency over multiple simulations. Our methods stand capture efficiencies low usually reported, and their accuracy depends on the number released mosquitoes, abundance, and survivor. We also show that gathering pupal counts allows estimating differences in survivorship between released and unmarked populations. Our model models are important to reduce uncertainty in evaluating MMR experiments and help planning future MRR studies."

This is important because it prevents the production of potentially deleterious truncated proteins from aberrant mRNAs, such as those that have undergone erroneous processing. How does the cell discriminate aberrant mRNAs from those that are normal? Here we present evidence that in human cells, the targeting of an mRNA to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay depends on a competition between proteins associated with the mRNA 3′ UTR that stimulate or antagonize mRNA decay. We show that cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, a protein associated with the mRNA 3′ end poly(A) tail, antagonizes mRNA decay. By contrast, a protein complex deposited onto mRNAs upon pre-mRNA splicing, called the exon junction complex, stimulates mRNA decay. Our observations suggest that the competition between these proteins, and probably other unknown proteins with similar activities, determines whether a key protein complex in the pathway, the Upf complex, is recruited to the mRNA upon translation termination, which leads to mRNA decay.","Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a process in which mRNAs undergo premature termination codons (PTCs) during rapid decay. The conserved Upf1–3 complex interacts with eukaryotic translation release factors, eRF3 and eRF1, and triggers NMD when translation termination takes place at the PTC. Contrasting models postulate the central roles of PTC-recognition and exon junction complex in mammals versus cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Here, we present evidence that in a unified model of NMD, PTC recognition in human cells is mediated by competition between 3′ and 3′ UTR–associated factors that stimulate the recruitment of the Upf complex to the terminating ribosome. We show that the intracellular PABP, a human NMD antagonizing factor, inhibits the interaction between eRf3 and upf1 in vitro and prevents NMD in cells positioned at the proximity of the termination codon. Surprisingly, the extended 3′ of the 3′UTR places cytoplyasmic PABp distally at the terminus codon, likely increasing the affinity of Upf proteins to 3′. Interestingly, artificial 3′ uTR > 420 nucleotides in the human cell trigger NMD. These findings suggest that NMD-defeating factors evolved to concentrate on one of the NMD inhibiting factors, pABP."

Examples include positioning of the site of cell division and determination of cell fate during embryonic development. This positional information often is encoded in concentration gradients. A specific protein is produced only within a small region, and subsequently spreads into the surrounding space. This leads to a spatial concentration gradient, with the highest protein concentration near the source. By switching on a signal only where the local concentration is above a certain threshold, this gradient can provide positional information. However, intrinsic randomness in biochemical reactions will lead to unavoidable fluctuations in the concentration profile, which in turn will lead to fluctuations in the identified position. We therefore investigated how precisely a noisy concentration gradient can specify positional information. We found that time-averaging of concentration measurements potentially allows for great precision to be achieved even with remarkably low protein copy numbers. We applied our results to a number of examples in both cell and developmental biology, including positioning of the site of cell division in bacteria and yeast, as well as gene expression in the developing Drosophila embryo.","The position determination of biological systems is achieved by measuring the local concentration of a protein in a spatially varying distribution. This allows measurement of the position of a system to be robust to noise. Here, we calculate the fundamental limits of the precision of position determination by concentration gradients. We focus on gradient proteins-order reaction kinetics in a single cell. We show that a single gradient, time- averaging, can be achieved with great precision, even if it is achieved with low protein copy numbers. We also show that positional precision close to the centre improves slowly increasing averaging time, longer averaging times and higher copy numbers required for high precision. We demonstrate that the optimal length scales of gradients can be maximized, but the precision depends on the size of the concentration-monitoring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints on the positional precision supplied by concentration gradient gradients in many contexts, including developmental biology and single cell biology."

In recent years, an international effort has been mounted to eliminate LF. In order to focus limited resources on areas with the highest disease burden, the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that mass drug treatment programs be focused in areas with >1% prevalence of the infection, working under the assumption that areas with <1% prevalence are equivalent to areas of limited or no transmission. We carried out an additional assessment in low-prevalence areas and observed evidence of active transmission and clustering of antigen-positive persons. Our results imply that a 1% infection threshold may not be sufficient to capture all remaining reservoirs of transmission.","Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major public health problem in Haiti. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that individuals with an area of infection prevalence greater than 1% (denoted by presence of microfilaremia antigenemia) receive mass drug administration (MDA) and antifilarial drugs for consecutive rounds. Areas with low-antigen prevalence ( <1%) are thought to pose little risk of continued transmission of LF. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of LF in two communes in Haiti, characterized by a national survey, and assessed the transmission study. The initial evaluation of schoolchildren performed in the commune was to identify antigen-positive children served as index cases. The second survey was conducted in households with neighboring index cases, and the third survey was to assess the likelihood of antigen-negative living within 20 meters of index cases controlling age, gender, and commune. Spatial clustering of antigen–positive cases was observed in all communes. Our results suggest that localized transmission is present in low-prevalence settings and suggest better surveillance methods needed to detect microfoci of LF transmission."

These include reducing social contacts by closing schools or postponing public events, and encouraging hand washing and the use of masks. These interventions will not only have a non-intuitive impact on the epidemic dynamics, but they will also have direct and indirect social and economic costs, which mean that governments will only want to use them for a limited amount of time. We use simulations to show that limited-time interventions that achieve one aim, e.g., contain the total number of cases below some maximum number of treatments available, are not the same as those that achieve another, e.g., minimize peak demand for health care services. If multiple aims are defined simultaneously, we often see that the optimal intervention need not commence immediately but can begin a few weeks into the epidemic. Our research demonstrates the importance of tailoring pandemic plans to defined policy targets with some flexibility to allow for uncertainty in the characteristics of the pandemic.","Influenza pandemic is one of the most severe pandemic epidemics in human history. In order to reduce the impact of an outbreak, it is necessary to buy time for vaccines to be developed, and to reduce social and economic costs. However, the non-linear effect of the epidemic dynamics means that suitable strategies crucially depend on the precise aim of the intervention. National pandemic influenza plans rarely contain clear statements about policy objectives and prioritization of potentially conflicting aims, such as minimizing mortality (depending on severity of the pandemic) and peak prevalence, and limiting the socio-economic burden of contact-reduction interventions. Here, we use epidemiological models of influenza to investigate whether contact-Reduction interventions and availability of antiviral drugs pre-pantemic vaccines contribute to achieving particular policy objectives. We show that the ideal strategy depends on the aim of intervention and that the policy objective does not preclude success, e.g. constraining peak demand for public health resources to lengthen the duration of the outbreak and its economic and social impact. Constraining total case numbers achieved in a range of strategies, strategies additionally can additionally constrain peak demand of services and require sophisticated intervention."

Here, nuclear and mtDNA data reveal genetic complexities of RVF key vectors (Aedes mcintoshi and Ae. ochraceus) partly explaining the disease outbreak pattern in Kenya. While anticipating population differentiation, we found that the hitherto known Ae. mcintoshi in fact comprises a species complex, with one unique species restricted to northeastern Kenya where outbreaks have increased in frequency with evidence for new involvement of Ae. ochraceus in RVF epidemiology. We infer a relatively recent, single “introduction” of Ae. ochraceus into Kenya with genetic links to a RVF hotspot in Senegal. Ultimately, our findings provide an understanding of how the two primary mosquito vector species impact RVF, which is critical to the potential prediction of the emergence and spread of the disease in Kenya.","Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks in Kenya have increased in frequency over the last decade. These outbreaks include northeastern Kenya viruses increasingly isolated from known (Aedes mcintoshi) and newly-associated (E. ochraceus) vectors. However, the factors contributing to changing outbreak patterns remain unclear. We conducted mitochondrial nuclear DNA analyses of >220 Kenyan specimens of Ae. mcintosh and Ae. oochraceus, and uncovered high levels of vector complexity that may partly explain the disease outbreak pattern. Our results indicate that Ae.mcintoshi consists of a complex member species of a unique newly-established RVF outbreak-prone northeastern region in Kenya, and that its homogeneous population appears to be undergoing expansion. Characterization of specimens from an RVF-prone site in Senegal, where we identified direct genetic links between Ae. c. and O. o. O. populations in other countries. These data strongly suggest that, unlike Ae. mccintoshi, the introduction of the virus into Kenya appears to have been relatively recent, with only a single 'introduction' into Kenya.

Cells respond to the Notch signal by changing which genes are transcribed. Most previous studies have looked at changes in gene activity at a single time point, long after the start of signaling. By looking at carefully timed intervals immediately after Notch pathway activation, we have been able to follow the dynamic changes in transcription of all the genes and have found that they exhibit different patterns of activity. For example, activity of some genes, especially a previously characterised family called the E(spl) genes, starts very early, whereas others show more delayed upregulation. Our investigations into the underlying mechanisms reveal that cross-regulatory interactions driven by the early genes are required to shape the timing of the delayed response. This feed-forward mechanism is important because it explains why the E(spl)/Hes genes can play such a pivotal role in the Notch response, despite the fact that many other genes are regulated by the signal, a finding that will be valuable for understanding the contribution of E(spl)/Hes genes in diseases associated with altered Notch.","The Notch signaling pathway is essential for the development of optimal homeostasis. In this study, we analyzed the transcript levels of genes involved in the Notch response. We found that the expression profiles of a number of genes, including the CSL [Suppressor Hairless, Su(H), and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), were significantly different in response to Notch stimulation. The expression profiles were stratified into 14 clusters based on timing, magnitude, and direction of DE. E(spl) and Pol II were rapidly upregulated, with transcript levels increasing 5–10 minutes after prolonged Notch activation. However, the timing of Pol II was largely unaffected, and the binding of the Pol II to Pol II did not fully explain the differences in expression profiles. Instead, our data indicate that regulatory interactions, driven by early-responding genes, are required for the co-ordination of Notch responses."

Species-dependent differences in cellular proteins that play key roles in virus replication, such as the primary HIV-1 receptor CD4, can limit virus tropism. Our data reveal how adaptation in macaques improves the ability of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins to use macaque CD4. Moreover, we identify a single amino acid in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein CD4 binding site that improves macaque CD4 use by most HIV-1 envelope proteins tested and allows viruses expressing these proteins to replicate efficiently in macaque cells without compromising their sensitivity to various antibodies.

Sometimes this genetic material is advantageous for bacterial cells, for example, by making them resistant to antibiotics. Other times, foreign DNA has genes that are deleterious to the new host. Bacteria have mechanisms for helping to silence exogenously (horizontally) acquired genes. Many horizontally acquired genes are A+T-rich, a feature which can be important in distinguishing these loci from the host genes. We found that the transcriptional regulator Rok in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis preferentially binds to A+T-rich DNA. Together with previous work, our findings indicate that Rok helps repress expression of A+T-rich genes, many of which are likely to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. In these ways, Rok appears to be a functional analogue of the H-NS protein found in Gram negative bacteria (e.g., E. coli) and Lsr2 found in the high G+C Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","Bacillus subtilis is a Gram negative bacterium that has been identified as a negative regulator of competence development. It controls expression of genes related to competence. We found that Rok binds to extended regions of the B. subtila genome. These regions are characterized by high A+T content and are believed to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Rok binding regions are known to be mobile genetic elements. We also found that deletion of rok resulted in a higher excision element, ICEBs1, in the genome. We identified a conserved C-terminal region of Rok that may have contributed to this association. Our previous work suggests that the Rok nucleoid associated protein serves to repress the expression of A-T-rich genes, which appear to have acquired through horizontal gene transfers. In other ways, Rok appears to be functionally analogous to H-NS, a nucleoid-associated protein found in Gram negative bacteria and Lsr2 in high G+C Mycobacteria."

Here, we report that two mouse X-linked homeobox genes implicated in reproduction, Rhox6 and 9, are activated by the histone demethylase KDM6A that removes methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3. Kdm6a is one in a small group of genes that escape X inactivation in mice and humans, and thus has female-biased expression. We found that knockdown of Kdm6a affects Rhox6 and 9 expression specifically in female ES cells. We also demonstrate that high expression of Rhox6 and 9 in mouse ovary is associated with recruitment of KDM6A to these genes, consistent with a role in a female-specific organ. Furthermore, we demonstrate paternal imprinting of Rhox6 and 9 in mouse ovary. The findings herein help to understand sex bias in the regulation of reproductive homeobox genes during early development and in ovary. Our findings provide clues into the sex-specific roles played by genes that escape from X inactivation, which may contribute to developmental defects and ovarian dysfunction in individuals with X chromosome abnormalities.","The Rhox cluster of the mouse X chromosome contains a number of reproduction-related homeobox genes that are expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner. Here we report that one of the members of the Rhox family, Rhox6 9, is regulated by de-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 and KDM6A, a histone demethylase that regulates female-biased expression. Consistent with the expression of other Rhox genes, the gene is expressed in two bivalent domains prior to embryonic stem cell differentiation and is poised for activation. In female mouse ES cells, we show that KDM 6A is specifically recruited to Rhox9 gene activation, and that this process is inhibited by Kdm6a knockdown in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, in the mouse ovary, the occupancy of Rhox 6 9 in low male ES cells does not have a knockdown effect on expression. Our study implicates the role of a gene that escapes X inactivation, which is important for reproduction, and implicates a role in the etiology of developmental reproduction-associated effects of X chromosome anomalies."

We previously found that in the yeast Ogataea polymorpha, homothallism is achieved by a novel mating-type switching mechanism that exchanges the locations of MATa and MATα genes between expression and repression contexts. Switching in this species is induced by nitrogen depletion, unlike the analogous process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that the upstream parts of the genetic pathway controlling the environmental induction of switching in O. polymorpha are the same as the environmental pathway that induces competence for mating in this species.","Ogataea (Hansenula) polymorpha is a diploid cell species that undergo a reversible change in the structure of their chromosome. This process, mating-type switching, inverts the 19-kb DNA region of the MATa MATα genes and centromeric repression of transcription, depending on orientation of the region. In this study, we investigated the genetic pathway that controls switching in O. polymora. We characterized transcriptomes of the haploid diploids of O.polymorpha using RNAseq in rich nitrogen-deficient media, and found constitutively-specific α-specific genes in MAT genes. We mapped switching defect in sibling species (O. parapolymorpha strain DL-1) and interspecies bulk segregant analysis using frameshift transcription factor EFG1, Candida albicans, which regulates filamentous growth and white- opaque switching. Gene knockout, overexpression, and ChIPseq experiments showed that the transcription factor RME1, which in turn regulates STE12, is necessary for switching mating. Overexpression of EME1 and STE12 was sufficient to induce switching of the nitrogen depletion signal, and homologous recombination of RAD51 and RAD17 were necessary for the switching of mating-types. Our results suggest that the pathway controlling switching in the O.

At the site of replication capsids have to release the genome, but after replication new capsids have to be assembled for encapsidation of the progeny genomes. Detailed data on stability of capsids and kinetics of their formation and dissociation are obtained for several viruses in vitro, allowing biophysical or electron microscopical techniques. These approaches, however, do not consider the impact of cellular interaction partners. Using digitonin-permeabilized cells which support hepadnaviral genome release actively, we analyzed the disassembly kinetic of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid. Using different analytical methods we found that HBV capsids disintegrate to protein dimers which reassemble to capsids inside the nucleus. The study provides a link between in vitro and in vivo data showing that HBV uses a unique strategy. We propose a model in which the unique environment of the nuclear pore favors the disassembly reaction, while both cytoplasm and nucleus favor assembly.","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the causative agent of hepatitis B disease. The viral genome is released from the cytoplasm by a nuclear pore, which is responsible for the assembly of viral capsids.

However, in vivo kinetics are poorly understood and transferability in vitro models of the cellular environment remains speculative. Here, we analyzed the kinetics of the hepatitis B virus in digitonin-permeabilized cells. We show that the HBV genome release occurs in a unique environment in which the nuclear Pore favors the viral capsid disassembly reaction, and that the nucleus does not favor capsid assembly. Our results suggest that the viral genome release is a unique strategy for different viruses, which employs irreversible capsid destruction upon genome release."

Previously, we have established that a conserved PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates immunity in C. elegans, establishing the conservation of key innate immune signaling pathways of mammals in the immune response of C. elegans. Whereas multiple proteins have been identified as potential targets of p38 MAPK in immunity, the identification of physiological substrates of p38 MAPK in mammalian organisms has been challenging. Here, using a forward genetic approach to identify downstream regulators of the C. elegans innate immune response, we have characterized the transcription factor ATF-7, a conserved member of the basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family orthologous to mammalian ATF2. We find that ATF-7 functions as a transcriptional regulator of PMK-1 MAPK–mediated innate immunity, functioning as a repressor of immune gene expression that undergoes a switch to an activator upon activation by PMK-1. Our data point to the regulation of the ATF2/ATF7/CREB5 family of transcriptional regulators by p38 MAPK as an ancient conserved mechanism for the control of innate immunity in metazoans and suggests a mechanism by which the protean effects of p38 MAPK on the mammalian innate immune response may be mediated.","Innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans requires the conserved PMK-1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to regulate the basal pathogen-induced expression of immune effectors.

Induction of T and B cell memory is the basis of vaccinations and cellular immunity to intracellular pathogens depends upon the number and quality of memory CD8 T cells. Understanding the mechanisms that control various facets of CD8 T cell memory is of fundamental importance for development of effective vaccines. In this study, we have identified the transcription factor FOXO3 as a crucial regulator of the magnitude of CD8 T cell memory. During a T cell response, FOXO3 limits the number of memory CD8 T cells by inhibiting the accumulation of memory precursor effector cells that give raise to long-lived CD8 T cells. Loss of FOXO3 activity in T cells led to a durable increase in the number of memory CD8 T cells, and the functional quality of FOXO3-deficient memory CD8 T cells was unaffected by FOXO3 deficiency. Thus, our studies suggest that targeting FOXO3 activity may be a fruitful strategy to augment vaccine-induced CD8 T cell memory and protective immunity.","CD8 T cell responses are characterized by three phases: expansion, contraction, and memory. Dynamic alterations in proliferation and apoptotic rates control the number of CD8 T cells in each phase, which in turn dictate the magnitude of CD4 T cell memory. Identification of signaling pathways that control CD8 cell memory is incomplete. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway controls cell growth and cell types by modulating the activity of FOXO transcription factors. The role of FOXOs in regulating CD8 and memory remains unknown. Here, we show that FOXO3 is required for the activation of the immune system in response to acute viral infection. We show that the enhanced accumulation of memory precursor effector cells is associated with an augmented rate of cell division, instead of with a reduction in cellular apoptosis. Our data suggest that the increased accumulation and expansion of memory precursors may be associated with enhanced proliferation and cell division."

The fraction of parasites specialized for transmission instead of replication (transmission investment) could change with each cycle of replication in response to changing conditions within the host. Measuring how transmission investment changes through time could help us understand how malaria spreads so efficiently through populations of human and other animals. However, transmission investment is usually impossible to measure directly and instead has to be estimated by comparing the number of transmission forms with total parasite numbers in blood samples. Here we use a model to simulate data from an infection—so that the true level of transmission investment is known—and test published methods for estimation. We find that existing methods do not accurately estimate transmission investment from simulated data, and we propose a new statistical method that works substantially better. When applied to rodent malaria data, our method suggests that transmission investment can vary substantially over the course of infection, with notably different patterns of allocation across hosts.","Malaria is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium chabaudi. The parasite infects new hosts in specialized life stages, requiring a subset of the parasite population to forgo proliferation and develop new transmission forms. Transmission stage production influences infectivity, host exploitation, and the impact of medical interventions like drug treatment. Predicting how the parasite will respond to public health efforts in epidemiological evolutionary timescales requires understanding transmission strategies. These strategies are rarely observed directly but are typically inferred from infection dynamics. In this malaria case study, we test previously described methods for inferring transmission stage investment from simulated data generated from model-host infection dynamics, but the true transmission investment is not known. We develop a new approach that performs better than simulated data. Applying this approach to real data from mice infected with a single Plasmarium chaudaudi strain, we estimate transmission investment varies from zero to 20%. We find that experimental infections and environmental factors are controlled, and parasites exhibit remarkably different patterns of transmission investment."

Here we used a genomic approach to identify new genes whose expression is restricted to the leading edge. A quantitative analysis revealed differential expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the leading edge, which was considered for a long time as homogeneous or amorphous. We demonstrate that anterior-posterior cues provide an orthogonal coordinate system specifying cell identity along the whole leading edge, making it a highly patterned morphogenetic center. We further show that these anterior-posterior cues are functionally important, controlling the dynamics of dorsal closure and participating to the robustness of the process. Our work sheds new light on the role of anterior-posterior cues in epithelial tissue sealing related to wound-healing.","Tissue morphogenesis relies on proper differentiation of morphogenetic domains, adopting specific cell behaviours. However, how signalling pathways interact to determine coordinate domains remains poorly understood. Dorsal closure (DC) in the Drosophila embryo represents a powerful model to study epithelial cell sheet sealing. In this process, JNK (JUN N-terminal Kinase) signalling controls leading edge (LE) differentiation, generating local forces of cell shape changes essential for DC. In addition to JNK, a number of signalling pathways converges and interacts ( anterior/posterior-AP- determination; segmentation genes, Wnt/Wingless; TGFβ/Decapentaplegic). To better characterize the properties of the LE morphogenetics domain, we sought new JNK target genes in a genomic approach: 25 identified 8 specifically expressed in LE, similarly to those that were previously identified in decapentapelegic and puckered. Quantitative in situ gene profiling of a new set of LE genes reveals a complex patterning of LE AP axis, involving a two-way interplay between the JNK pathway, segmentation and HOX genes. Patterning LE discrete domains appears essential for coordination of tissue sealing dynamics."

Progressive production of PrPSc through the constitutive conformational conversion of PrPC into PrPSc underlies prion propagation. However, the mechanism enabling progressive production of PrPSc in prion-infected cells remains unknown. We here found that the VPS10P sorting receptor sortilin is involved in degradation of PrPC and PrPSc in infected cells by binding to both molecules and subsequently trafficking them to the lysosomal protein degradation pathway. Interestingly, we also found that degradation of sortilin was stimulated in lysosomes in prion-infected cells possibly as a result of the sortilin-PrPC or -PrPSc complexes being trafficked to lysosomes. Our findings indicate that PrPSc itself impairs the sortilin-mediated degradation of PrPC and PrPSc by stimulating degradation of sortilin in lysosomes. This eventually results in progressive production of PrPSc in prion-infected cells by increasing the opportunity of PrPC to convert into PrPSc and by accumulating the already produced PrPSc. This mechanism was confirmed in sortilin-KO mice infected with prions. The mice had exacerbated prion disease with earlier accumulation of PrPSc in their brains.","Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by prions, which consist mainly of the abnormally folded isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc. The pivotal pathogenic event of prion disease is the progressive accumulation of prions in the brains of infected cells. The cellular mechanism of the accumulation of the cellular prion proteins, PrPC, and prPSc, remains unknown. In this study, we show that prion-infected cells are degraded by the VPS10P sorting receptor sortilin. We show that the degradation of PrPC and PrPsc leads to the accumulation and degradation of the lysosomes, which are essential for prion formation. In contrast, the overexpression of sortilins reduced the accumulation in prion infected cells, but not in prions. Our results indicate that the accumulation is mediated by the sortILin-mediated sorting of the PrPC/PrPSc lysomes and that this is the first step in the accumulation process."

With over 500,000 new infections per year, brucellosis is the most prevalent zoonosis worldwide and incurs significant human morbidity and economic loss. The intracellular location of Brucella renders the organism resistant to antibiotics. A safe and effective human vaccine does not exist. Thus, better understanding of the host-pathogen interactions supporting establishment of the intracellular replicative niche is critical. In this study, we found that infection of macrophages with Brucella induces a host stress response called the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a conserved stress response originating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Full induction of the UPR requires live bacteria and expression of a microtubule modulating protein, TcpB. Inhibition of the UPR with the drug tauroursodeoxycholic acid significantly diminished Brucella replication. Together these results suggest Brucella induces the UPR to enable its own replication within host macrophages. Thus the UPR may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of brucellosis.","Brucella melitensis is a facultative intracellular bacterium that causes brucellosis, which is prevalent in zoonosis worldwide. Brucella replicates in a niche in macrophages and dendritic cells, which thwarts immune surveillance and complicates therapy and vaccine development. Currently, the host-pathogen interactions supporting the replication are poorly understood. In this study, we show that Brucellas fuses the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to replicate, resulting in a dramatic restructuring of the ER. This ER disruption raises the possibility that B. melitiens induces a stress response called Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which is activated by the expression of the UPR target genes BiP, CHOP, ERdj4, and induced XBP1 mRNA splicing in murine cells.

The disease is better controlled when affected communities are included in the planning and carrying out of distribution of Ivermectin used to treat the disease. For a community to be able to prevent people from getting this disease, members must take Ivermectin once or twice a year, continuously for about 20 years. Hence, the organization in charge of controlling river blindness (African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control–APOC) decided that when a control programme is started in a community, the community must be involved and assisted to take full charge of the programme so that within 12 years the community can sustain the distribution of Ivermectin for as long as necessary. This community directed strategy prevented river blindness in many communities. However, after 10–12 years of implementation, studies found that river blindness largely persists in communities in three drainage basins in South West Region of Cameroon. This paper discussed the operational challenges that the programme may have faced in these areas.","Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects more than 1.5 million people in South West Cameroon.

The majority of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa where there is a lack of diagnostic resources and expertise, making it difficult to develop effective prevention and control strategies. In recent years, several real-time RT-PCR based diagnostic assays have been introduced to many developing countries in an effort to control the H1N1 pandemic flu, Ebola outbreak, and other tropical viral infections. In an effort to further improve rabies diagnostics, we developed a pan-lyssavirus Taqman real-time RT-PCR assay called LN34 for the detection of all known RABV variants and other lyssavirus species. The LN34 assay uses a combination of degenerate nucleotides, multiplex primers and probes, and unique probe modifications to achieve superior sensitivity and specificity compared to previously published RT-PCR based rabies diagnostics. Equally important, the LN34 assay is simple to set up, high throughput, combines multiple standard controls and can be used directly in widely available real-time RT-PCR systems. The LN34 assay was validated using a broad and comprehensive panel of highly diverse RABV variants and other lyssaviruses. A validated universal rabies diagnostic assay will be important in regions where RABV and other lyssaviruses co-circulate and for establishing a widely accepted diagnostic protocol. Over 200 clinical samples (including ante-mortem, post-mortem, and field derived samples) were tested with the LN34 assay, and the assay achieved 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in our laboratory. Over 300 published genome sequences from representatives of RABV and other lyssaviruses were found to contain the conserved LN34 primer and probe targeting sites in an in silico analysis. We are expanding the validation of the LN34 assay to multiple domestic and international laboratories and expect the LN34 assay will drastically improve rabies diagnostic capacities globally.","Rabies, resulting from infection with Rabies virus (RABV) and related lyssaviruses, is one of the most deadly zoonotic diseases responsible for 70,000 estimated human deaths worldwide each year. Rapid accurate laboratory diagnosis of rabies is essential for timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis in humans and control of disease in animals. Currently, a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test is recommended for routine rabies diagnosis. However, there is no currently widely accepted rapid real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of RABV and related Lyssavirus species. In this study, we demonstrate the validation of a newly developed multiplex real time RT-PRR assay named LN34, which uses a combination of degenerate primers and probes to probe modifications to achieve superior coverage of the Lyssvirus genus while maintaining sensitivity and specificity. The primers probes of the assay target a highly conserved non-coding leader region of the nucleoprotein (N) coding sequence of LyssVirus genome and maintain the assay robustness. The probes are modified to increase melting temperature to meet the requirements for the optimal real-life RT-RR assay. The LNN34 assay is able to detect RABVs and lyssviruses in a validation panel that included representative RABR isolates from regions of the world and 13 additional Lyssovirus species from 13 additional species. This assay provides an alternative approach to rabies diagnostics, especially in rural areas where rabies endemic regions lack the conditions and broad experience required to run a standard DFA assay."

It is caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors, leading to destruction of insulin-secreting cells. Although significant progress has recently been made in elucidating the genetics of T1D, the non-genetic component has remained poorly defined. Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of DNA, are indispensable for genomic processes such as transcriptional regulation and are frequently perturbed in human disease. We therefore hypothesized that epigenetic variation could underlie some of the non-genetic component of T1D aetiology, and we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of a specific subset of immune cells (monocytes) from monozygotic twins discordant for T1D. This revealed the presence of T1D–specific methylation variable positions (T1D–MVPs) in the T1D–affected co-twins. Since these T1D–MVPs were found in MZ twins, they cannot be due to genetic differences. Additional experiments revealed that some of these T1D–MVPs are found in individuals before T1D diagnosis, suggesting they arise very early in the process that leads to overt T1D and are not simply due to post-disease associated factors (e.g. medication or long-term metabolic changes). T1D–MVPs may thus potentially represent a previously unappreciated, and important, component of type 1 diabetes risk.","Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a complex autoimmune disease that affects more than 50 million people in the United States.

It was recently shown to share a common ancestor with viral proteins that drive fusion of the viral envelope with host membranes, but its mechanism of action remained elusive, since the reported structure did not resolve the proposed membrane interaction surface. Here, we report two new HAP2 structures revealing that HAP2 has evolved diverse membrane interaction surfaces. In the flowering plants, HAP2 uses an amphipathic helix that presents nonpolar residues to the target membrane; in trypanosomes, the membrane interaction surface comprises three shallow nonpolar loops.","HAPLESS2 (HAP2) is a broadly conserved, gamete-expressing transmembrane protein that is shown to initiate fusion in host cells by insertion of fusion loops into the host membrane.

At the crux of (and critically required for) meiotic chromosome segregation is a transient association between homologous chromosomes established by a crossover recombination event. Recombination intermediates embed within a ~100 nm wide proteinaceous structure that connects aligned homologous axes, the synaptonemal complex (SC). While genetic data implicate certain SC structural proteins in crossover formation, it is unclear how such coiled-coil, rod-like proteins carry out their recombination function. Our structure-function analysis of the yeast SC transverse filament protein, Zip1, reveals pro-crossover and pro-synapsis functions that are encompassed by adjacent N terminal regions. We also discovered that the pro-crossover region of Zip1 promotes proper localization of pro-crossover factor and putative SUMO ligase, Zip3, to meiotic recombination sites. Zip3 is known to not only promote crossovers but also to influence the post-translational modification of another SC structural component, Ecm11, which is dispensable for crossovers. Our findings raise the possibility that Zip1’s N terminus acts as a liaison to connect pro-crossover factors (like Zip3) to SC assembly proteins (such as Ecm11) in order to coordinate the two landmark meiotic chromosomal processes.","Chromosomal segregation in meiosis relies on prior establishment of a crossover recombination event between homologous chromosomes. This crossover event is embedded in a hallmark chromosomal structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC). However, the mechanisms that coordinate the processes of SC assembly (synapsis) crossover and recombination remain poorly understood. In budding yeast, the Zip1 protein plays a unique independent role in promoting crossover and crossovers. Here, we report that two adjacent regions of Zip1 at the N terminus encompass crossover synapsis functions. We previously showed that deletion of the two Zip1 residues 21–163 abolishes tripartite SC assembly and prevents the robust SUMOylation of the SC central element component, Ecm11, which allows excess MutSγ crossover to occur. We find that the reciprocal phenotype of mutants with mutant SC assembles and is hyperSUMOylated, but Mutsγ crossover is strongly diminished. Interestingly, deletion of two of the three Zip1 amino acid residues 2–9 2–14 is required for normal localization of Zip3, a putative E3 SUMO ligase and pro-MutSγ cross factor, and that Zip1 polycomplex structures recombination initiation sites. Our results suggest that two distinct N terminal regions are differentially critical for Zip1 roles in crossing SC assembly."

Instead of representing the original pressure waveforms, the inner ear represents how the energy in a sound is distributed across frequency bands and how the energy distribution evolves over time. The generation of cochleagrams is highly non-linear resulting in the dominance of one sound source per time-frequency bin under natural conditions (masking). Auditory cortex is believed to decompose cochleagrams into structural primitives, i.e., reappearing regular spectro-temporal subpatterns that make up cochleagram patterns (similar to edges in images). However, such a decomposition has so far only been modeled without considering masking and non-negativity. Here we apply a novel non-linear sparse coding model that can capture masking non-linearities and non-negativities. When trained on cochleagrams of natural sounds, the model gives rise to an encoding primarily based-on spectro-temporally localized components. If stimulated by a sound, the encoding units compete to explain its contents. The competition is a direct consequence of the statistical sound model, and it results in neural responses being best described by spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) with positive and negative subfields. The emerging STRFs show a higher similarity to experimentally measured STRFs than a model without masking, which provides evidence for cortical encoding being consistent with the masking based sound statistics of cochleagrams. Furthermore, and more generally, our study suggests for the first time that negative subfields of STRFs may be direct evidence for explaining away effects resulting from performing inference in an underlying statistical model.","Hypothesising auditory cortex (A1) represents the structural primitives of sounds composed, and we employ a statistical model to extract components from these components. The input model cochleagrams approximate non-linear transformations of how sound undergoes in the outer ear, cochlear, and the auditory nerve. Cochleagram components superimpose linearly, according to a rule approximated by max function. The consequence of compression is that the cochlagrams have negative values. We find that the non-negative subfields are more likely to explain away effects than the positive subfields. We consider a new encoding approach for natural sounds, which combines a model of early auditory processing maximal causes analysis (MCA) with a sparse coding model that captures non-negativity data. The efficient truncated EM algorithm can fit the MCA model and cochlesagram data. We characterize generative fields (GFs) inferred from MCA respect to in vivo neural responses to A1 by applying reverse correlation to the spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) implied from the learned GFs. Despite the GFs being non-positive, STRF estimates are found to contain positive and negative subfields, which are attributed to explaining away effects captured by the applied inference method. In summary, our model represents alternative linear approaches to biological auditory encoding that captures salient data properties and links inhibitory subfields explaining away the away effects."

Here, we focused on the processing of temporal and/or spatial information in the proximal and distal parts of CA1 and CA3 in mice to test whether the two concepts are reconcilable. To do so, we used an imaging method with cellular resolution based on the detection of the RNA of the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Arc, which is tied to synaptic plasticity and memory demands, and correlated imaging results with memory performance. Our data confirm the existence of subnetworks segregated along the proximodistal axis of CA1 and CA3 that preferentially process spatial and non-spatial information and suggest a key involvement of distal CA1 in temporal information processing. In addition, they show that the two models are complementary to a large extent and posit the “segregated” model as a viable alternative for the two-streams hypothesis.","In episodic memory, episodic information is processed by two distinct pathways in the hippocampus. These pathways project to distinct proximodistal levels of the hippocampus and are segregated along the recently described memory tasks in a spatial non-spatial salient dimension. However, the concept of segregated subnetworks in the traditional model is reconcilable by studying activity of CA1 and CA3 in the segregated dimensions of the salient, case episodes. Simultaneously, we investigated the correlations between brain activity and spatial and/or temporal discrimination ratios between the proximal distal CA1 CA3 and the spatial information processing CA1 in Arc RNA mice. Our results suggest that the segregation of the segregated networks between the temporal information processing and CA1/CA3 remains reconcilable, to a large extent, in the forward distal and the possible “home” location of time cells."

These vesicles deliver toxins and other virulence factors to host cells during infection. Current methods for studying host cell entry are limited due to the nanometer size and rapid uptake kinetics of vesicles. Here we developed a method to monitor the rapid vesicle entry into host cells in real-time. This method highlighted differences in kinetics and entry route of vesicles into host cells, which varied with the bacterial cell wall composition and thus, the vesicle surface. Increased understanding of vesicular entry mechanisms could identify targets which may allow us to combat infections by inhibiting delivery of vesicle-associated toxins to host cells.","Outer membrane vesicles, nano-sized microvesicles shed from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, play important roles in immune priming and disease pathogenesis. However, the current mechanistic understanding of vesicle-host cell interactions is limited by the lack of methods to study the rapid kinetics of the entry and cargo delivery of host cells. Here, we describe a highly sensitive method that allows us to study kinetics and entry into host cells in real-time using a genetically encoded, vesicular-targeted probe. We found that the route of the uptake, entry and kinetics efficiency, are shaped by bacterial cell wall composition. The presence of lipopolysaccharide O antigen enables the uptake of the veses to bypass clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and enhances entry rate efficiency. Collectively, our findings highlight the composition of bacterial cell walls as a major determinant of secretion-independent delivery of virulence factors."

Accumulating evidence has suggested that certain environmental compounds may play an important role in weight gain and obesity development.The potential endocrine-disrupting effects of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been demonstrated in animal studies, but whether PFASs may interfere with body weight regulation in humans is largely unknown.In a 2-year diet-induced weight-loss trial (the POUNDS Lost trial), we measured plasma concentrations of PFASs at baseline in 621 overweight and obese men and women and collected information on changes in body weight, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and other metabolic parameters during weight loss and weight regain over the 2 years the participants were on the study diet.Higher baseline levels of PFASs were significantly associated with a greater weight regain, primarily in women. On average, women in the highest tertile of PFAS concentrations regained 1.7–2.2 kg more body weight than women in the lowest tertile.Higher baseline plasma concentrations of PFASs, especially perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), were significantly associated with greater decline in RMR during the first 6 months and less increase in RMR during the period when participants on average regained weight (6–24 months).In this diet-induced weight-loss trial, higher baseline PFAS concentrations were associated with a greater weight regain, especially in women, possibly explained by a slower return of RMR levels. These data provide initial evidence suggesting that PFASs may interfere with human body weight regulation and counteract efforts to maintain weight loss in adults.","Pfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been shown to interfere with body weight regulation in humans.

Inflammasomes are crucial to host defence but require tight regulation in order to prevent inappropriate inflammation and immunopathology. Here, we demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory potential of an attenuated strain of Chlamydia trachomatis, that fails to activate the inflammasome, can be rescued by the addition of a bacterial metabolite. The requirement for this metabolite, highlights a novel mechanism of inflammasome regulation and reveals a crucial role for STING mediated interferon signalling independent of cGAS. These findings further our understanding of how the innate immune system can differentiate between potential infectious and non-infectious threats and mount appropriate immune responses.","The innate immune system is a critical component of the host defence against microbial pathogens, but effective responses require the ability to distinguish infectious and non-infectious insult to prevent inappropriate inflammation. In this study, we identified critical host pathogen factors that contribute to the induction of inflammasome activation. We assayed inflammaome activation by immunoblotting and ELISA to detect IL-1β processing and LDH release and determine pyroptosis. We found that in live attenuated Chlamydia trachomatis, the live organism activates canonical non-canonical infammasomes, whereas canonical inflammesomes were controlled by IF-1α processing. We also found that the NADPH oxidase deficient macrophages and permissive Chlamydyls displayed elevated type-1 interferon inflammia activation. Conversely, attenuated, non-replicating Chlamyls, which were primed to activate inflammomes, were stimulated by reduced type-2 interferons. Our data suggest that bacterial replication metabolism and metabolism are important factors that determine interfilaron responses to inflammeome activation, and that the STING cGAS is a central mediator of interferonic activation.

In addition to extrinsic variability caused by environmental fluctuations, cells face intrinsic variability arising from the inherent noise of gene expression and of other molecular processes. microRNAs, which act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, are beginning to be recognized for their ability to confer robustness to biological systems by buffering the effects of noisy gene expression. Although noise often is viewed as destabilizing, some biological processes make use of noise in order to make stochastic decisions. In this paper, we describe a role for microRNAs in preventing the stochastic elimination of excess cells in the developing fly retina. After the sense organs that make up the eye have been specified, pruning of excess cells occurs through the action of the gene hid, the expression of which triggers cell death. Specific mechanisms are needed to protect specialized cells which need to be maintained to ensure that only excess cells are eliminated. We report that a pair of related microRNAs, miR-263a/b, protect sense organs during this pruning process by directly acting upon and limiting the expression of the proapoptotic gene hid. This example, illustrates a novel function for miRNAs in ensuring developmental robustness during apoptotic tissue pruning.","The Drosophila mechanosensory bristles are a family of microRNAs that are expressed in the peripheral sense organs of the animal kingdom. We present evidence that miR-263a and its sister family, microRNA-263b, play an important role in protecting the D. melanogaster from apoptosis by regulating the pro-apoptotic gene head involution. We show that the two microRNA are expressed at bristle progenitors, despite a difference in seed sequence, and share a key common target. We also show that loss of the bristles appears to be sporadic, suggesting that the role of microRNAAs is to ensure robustness of the patterning process in promoting the survival of functionally specified cells in the retina."

In tropical countries where lymphatic filariasis occurs, approximately 14 million people suffer from chronic swelling of the leg, known as lymphedema. Repeated episodes of bacterial skin infection (acute attacks) cause lymphedema to progress to its disfiguring form, elephantiasis. To help achieve the goal of eliminating lymphatic filariasis globally, the World Health Organization recommends basic lymphedema management, which emphasizes hygiene, skin care, exercise, and leg elevation. Its effectiveness in reducing acute attack frequency, as well as the role of compressive bandaging, have not been adequately evaluated in filariasis-endemic areas. Between 1995 and 1998, we studied 175 people with lymphedema of the leg in Leogane, Haiti. During Phase I of the study, when compression bandaging was used to reduce leg volume, the average acute attack rate was 1.56 episodes per year; it was greater in people who were illiterate and those who used compression bandages. After March 1997, when hygiene and skin care were emphasized and bandaging discouraged, acute attack frequency significantly decreased to 0.48 episodes per year. This study highlights the effectiveness of hygiene and skin care, as well as limitations of compressive bandaging, in managing lymphedema in filariasis-endemic areas.","Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium Wuchereria bancrofti.

In this study, we prospectively evaluated the effectiveness of basic lymphedema management, which emphasizes hygiene, skin care, exercise, and leg elevation, to reduce ADLA frequency. We prospectively monitored ADLA incidence and leg volume in 175 persons living in Leogane, Haiti, an area endemic with Wucheria.

The methods currently being used to control a range of these diseases do not appear sufficient to address the issues at hand. As such, alternate methods for the control of vector-borne diseases are currently being investigated. Among the promising techniques currently being considered are a range of genetic control methods known as gene drive systems. These allow desirable genetic traits (such as a much reduced capacity for vectors to transmit viruses) to be spread through a target population; taking advantage of natural mate seeking behaviour to locate vector sub-populations that can be extremely difficult for humans to locate and reach. Here we use mathematical models (parameterised to consider mosquito populations) to demonstrate the robustness of the engineered underdominance and killer-rescue classes of gene drive to different ecological factors including birth and death rates; the number and quality of breeding sites (i.e. carrying capacity); and the strength of density-dependent competition during the larval development phase. We then go on to explore the range of potential outcomes that may result from the migration of individuals between two neighbouring populations.","The Aedes aegypti mosquito locus is a mosquito-vector that is genetically engineered to increase the frequency of the population, spreading associated with desirable genetic traits. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. self-sustaining) whilst the killer-rescue system rescue component initially increase frequency (lethal component (killer) is more common) and eventually declining (killer rare) when it is eliminated. The effects of ecological factors on gene drive systems are considered alternative modelling methodologies. We formulate a new set of mathematical models combining population dynamics and population genetics classes of gene drive to incorporate ecological factors previously studied simple to allow the effects to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on potential effects obtained from the result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared to their wild-type counterparts. We extend models to consider population dynamics demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal of neighbouring populations on the outcome of the UD KR gene drive system."

This challenge is most apparent when studying complex responses, such as those occurring during the dynamic period of embryonic development, when the phenotype changes markedly through time.

We demonstrate the broad applicability of EmbryoPhenomics using four experiments assessing responses to global change (elevated temperature and salinity) in which we generate data for more than 600 embryos produced from video comprising more than 30 million images. EmbryoPhenomics was used to capture functional, temporal, and spatial change in morphological, physiological, and behavioural responses in the earliest, most dynamic life stages and addresses a serious bottleneck in biology. Such capabilities are urgently required, particularly within the context of assessing the response of embryos to the current unprecedented rates of global environmental change.","Phenomics has potential to facilitate significant advances in biology and requires the development of high-throughput technologies capable of generating and analysing high-dimensional data.

The massive genome sequencing of recent years has unearthed vast numbers of paleoviruses from various animal genomes, including the first endogenous hepatitis B viruses (eHBVs) in bird genomes. We screened genomes of land vertebrates (amniotes) for the presence of paleoviruses and identified ancient eHBVs in the recently sequenced genomes of crocodilians, snakes, and turtles. We report an eHBV that is >207 million years old, making it the oldest endogenous virus currently known. Furthermore, our results provide direct evidence that the Hepadnaviridae virus family infected birds, crocodilians and turtles during the Mesozoic Era, and suggest a long-lasting coexistence of these viruses and their amniote hosts at least since the Early Mesozoic. We challenge previous views on the origin of the oncogenic X gene and provide an evolutionary explanation as to why only mammalian hepatitis B infection leads to hepatocellular carcinoma.","Hepadnaviridae is a family of double-stranded DNA viruses that infect species of birds and mammals.

Whereas antiretroviral treatment succeeds to control viral replication, some patients fail to reconstitute their CD4+ T cell count to normal value. IL-7 is a promising cytokine under evaluation for its use in HIV infection, in supplement to antiretroviral therapy, as it increases cell proliferation and survival. Here, we use data from three clinical trials testing the effect of IL-7 on CD4+ T-cell recovery in treated HIV-infected individuals and use a simple mathematical model to quantify IL-7 effects by estimating the biological parameters of the model. We show that the increase of peripheral proliferation could not explain alone the long-term dynamics of T cells after IL-7 injections underlining other important effects such as the improvement of cell survival. We also investigate the feasibility and the efficiency of repetitions of IL-7 cycles and argue for further evaluation through clinical trials.","Exogenous Interleukin-7 (IL-7), a supplement to antiretroviral therapy, leads to a substantial increase in CD4+ T cell subsets in HIV-1 infected patients.

We found that IL+7 exerts additional effects on CD4 and T cell dynamics at 52 weeks. A decrease in the loss rate of total CD4/T cell counts is a probable explanation for the effect maintained after repeated administration with IL-8.

The infection triggers an acute febrile illness, the paroxysms, occurring every 48 or 72 hours depending on the species. Plasmodium vivax, in most cases, does not cause severe malaria, but it is the most geographically widespread parasite responsible for human disease and causes substantial costs to individuals and governments. Once the parasite reaches the blood stream, they infect reticulocytes that can be destroyed by phagocytes. Our goal was to assess the importance of monocyte subsets during malaria. We found that P. vivax infection causes an increase in frequency of circulating monocytes, which were defined as classical, inflammatory, and patrolling, based on the expression of membrane molecules. Classical and inflammatory monocytes produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and were distinguished from patrolling monocytes by displaying larger and more active mitochondria. Importantly, inflammatory monocytes were more efficient phagocytes; produced high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and TNF and consequently control better Plasmodium vivax infection. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that CD14+CD16+ monocytes display effector functions involved in parasite control during malaria.","Infection with Plasmodium vivax results in strong activation of monocytes, important components of the systemic inflammatory response to parasite control. The overall goal of this study was to define the role of monocyte activation in P. vivx malaria.

Morphologically, CD14+ differentiated from CD14lo monocytes displaying larger active mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that CD14− differentiated from the CD14-CD16+ monocytes by displaying a larger number of mitochondria and efficient phagocytizing of infected reticulocytes, induced by high levels of intracellular TNF-α and reactive oxygen species.

However, CNS inflammation and neurological symptoms are complications that can occur in severe cases. This outcome of disease is regularly observed in T and B cell-deficient C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice upon infection with R. typhi. We show here that CD4+ T cells are as protective as cytotoxic CD8+ T cells against R. typhi as long as they are present in time. This is evidenced by the fact that neither CD8+ nor CD4+ T cell-deficient C57BL/6 mice develop disease which is also true for R. typhi-infected C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice that receive immune CD8+ or CD4+ at an early point in time. Moreover, adoptive transfer of immune CD4+ T cells still protects approximately 60% of C57BL/6 RAG1-/- mice when applied later in advanced infection when the bacteria start to rise. Although CD8+ T cells are faster and more efficient in bacterial elimination, R. typhi is not detectable in CD4+ T cell recipients anymore. We further show that immune CD4+ T cells activate bactericidal functions of microglia and macrophages in the CNS in vivo and inhibit bacterial growth in infected macrophages in vitro which is in part mediated by the release of IFNγ. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that CD4+ T cells alone are sufficient to protect against R. typhi infection. With regard to vaccination our findings suggest that the induction of R. typhi-specific CD4+ TH1 effector T cells may be as effective as the much more difficult targeting of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.","Rickettsia typhi is an intracellular bacterium that causes endemic typhus, febrile disease, and fatal complications including pneumonia, hepatitis and meningoencephalitis.

Moreover, CD8+ T cell-deficient mice advanced infection without showing symptoms of disease at the point of time. Furthermore, we show that the induction of CD4-TH1 effector cells at the time of infection protected approximately 60% of animals from death. Our findings suggest that induction of T cells in the resident microglia of the CNS may contribute to bacterial killing and accelerate pathology."

The O1 antigen is a constituent of the lipopolysaccharide portion of the outer membrane, and its location on the bacterial surface makes it a major target of both the immune system and bacteriophages. We used an O1-specific bacteriophage as a tool to understand if, and how, V. cholerae can alter O1 antigen expression. We discovered that two genes, which are critical for O1 antigen biosynthesis, are subject to phase variation. Additionally, one of the phase variable genes we identified was not previously known to play a role in O1 antigen biosynthesis in V. cholerae. Phase variation is a well-recognized mechanism many other bacterial pathogens use to generate variable expression of surface components, and this is generally thought to help these organisms evade the immune system. Phase variation has not previously been described as a widespread mechanism used by V. cholerae, furthermore, this is the first report that V. cholerae O1 is capable of generating diverse populations with variable and unique O1 antigen expression.","Vibrio cholerae is a bacteriophage that is a major target of the human immune system and is critical for vaccine design. The O1 antigen is a lipopolysaccharide that is required for the virulence of the bacterium. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism by which the organism modulates O antigen expression to exhibit intra-strain heterogeneity. We identified phase variable genes required for O1-specific biosynthesis, manA and wbeL. manA resides outside of a previously recognized O1 protein biosynthetic locus, and encodes a phosphomannose isomerase critical for the initial step of O1 and antigen biosynthesis. We determined that manA wbL and manA phase variants attenuated virulence, providing functional evidence to support the critical role of O antigen in infectivity. This study provides the first report of phase variation in modulating O1 or antigen expression in V. cholae, demonstrating that maintenance of phase variable loci is an important means for the facultative pathogen to generate diverse subpopulations of cells needed for infecting the host intestinal tract and escaping predation by an O-specific phage."

Our results showed that the parasite population had a predominant clonal propagation, reproducing themselves with identically or closely related parasites; therefore, the same genetic characteristics are maintained in the offspring. The clonal propagation may favour the higher levels of genetic differentiation among the parasites from isolated areas compared to areas where human migration is common. The patterns of gene flow have been established, finding Iquitos city as a reservoir of parasite genetic variability. Moreover, a recent reduction of the parasite population was observed in areas where recent control activities were performed.

Gram-positive bacteria secrete oligopeptide quorum-sensing signals that bind to membrane-bound and cytosolic receptors. How oligopeptide quorum-sensing signals regulate the activity of their target receptors was previously largely unknown. Here we show that proteins belonging to the family of bacterial quorum-sensing receptors known as the Rap phosphatases undergo a remarkable regulatory conformational change upon binding oligopeptide signals. More specifically, in the absence of the oligopeptide signal, Rap proteins consist of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain consisting of a three-helix bundle, and a superhelical C-terminal domain comprising an array of seven similar helix-turn-helix repeats. A flexible helix-containing linker region connects these domains. In complex with the regulatory oligopeptide, however, the Rap protein domains and linker region rearrange, merging to form a single continuous superhelical structure consisting of nine helix-turn-helix repeats. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of conformational change-induced repeat domain expansion. The structure-function studies presented here set the stage for the rational development of antimicrobial peptides and peptide-mimetics capable of targeting cell–cell signaling mediated by Rap proteins and similar bacterial receptors.","A large family of Gram-positive quorum-sensing receptors known as RNPP proteins consists of receptors homologous to Rap, NprR, PlcR, and PrgX proteins that are regulated by imported oligopeptide autoinducers.

Despite their obvious importance, the mechanistic basis of the oligopesptide receptor regulation is largely unknown. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the Bacillus subtilis quorum sensing receptor RapJ complex, a centrally important ligand-switchable protein. We show that Rap protein conformational change-induced repeat domain expansion is induced by the C-terminal tetratricopeptides repeat (TPR) domain, which is connected to a flexible helix-containing linker and N-terminally folded 3-helix bundle. Furthermore, we show that the Rap protein is conformationally flexible and that it adopts different conformations. This is surprising considering the accepted dogma that TPR proteins undergo large conformational changes, and that they undergo radical conformational rearrangements, which merge with the existing C- terminal TPR domain."

As a consequence, viral genomes become valuable resources to reconstruct the spatial and temporal processes that are shaping epidemic or endemic dynamics. In molecular epidemiology, spatial inference is often limited to the interpretation of evolutionary histories with respect to the sampling locations of the pathogens. To test hypotheses about the spatial diffusion patterns of viruses, analytical techniques are required that enable us to reconstruct how viruses migrated in the past. Here, we develop a model to infer diffusion processes among discrete locations in timed evolutionary histories in a statistically efficient fashion. Applications to Avian Influenza A H5N1 and Rabies virus in Central and West African dogs demonstrate several advantages of simultaneously inferring spatial and temporal processes from gene sequences.","The geographical distribution of viruses is frequently interpreted by light genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal patterns and migration patterns of viruses mainly relies on model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage statistical endeavor. We introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping of Bayesian software samples from time-scale phylogenies, we enable reconstruction of timed viral dispersal pattern accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. We also introduce a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that incorporate geographical sampling distributions to characterize alternative hypotheses about spatial dynamics in the virtual globe software. We describe how this approach compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of influenza H5N1 origin and H5Ns1 epidemiological linkage sampling localities. Our analyses show that virus diffusion can enable endemic maintenance and continuous epidemic cycles."

Sex chromosomes have a sex-biased transmission, a pattern which might create favourable conditions for the spread of sexually antagonistic alleles (i.e. alleles beneficial for one sex but deleterious for the other). Yet, expectations for genetic systems with unusual inheritance of sex chromosomes may differ from those derived from standard systems (e.g. XY). Here we demonstrate theoretically that in organisms such as aphids, which alternate sexual and asexual reproduction and display an unusual inheritance of the X chromosome, male-beneficial sexually antagonistic alleles accumulate preferentially on that chromosome, while asexual female-beneficial alleles accumulate on autosomes. Theoretical models suggest that the evolution of sex-biased gene expression may solve such sexual conflicts, by restricting the product of a sexually antagonistic allele to the sex it benefits. We show that in the pea aphid, the genomic location (X versus autosomes) of genes with a sex-biased expression fits predictions derived from this hypothesis. On top of reporting a strong masculinization of the aphid X chromosome, our study highlights the relevance of organisms with an alternative mode of sex chromosome inheritance to understanding the evolutionary forces shaping chromosome evolution.","Sexual antagonistic mutations accumulate on differentially X chromosome autosomes in species of the XY sex-determination system, with effects (masculinization and feminization of X) depending on dominance mutations. Organisms displaying alternative modes of inheritance of sex chromosomes offer interesting opportunities for studying sexual conflicts resolution, but expectations of the preferred genomic location of sexually antagonistic alleles differ from standard systems. Aphids display the XX/X0 system, which combine unusual inheritance of X chromosome alternation with sexual asexual reproduction. In this study, we investigated theoretically the accumulation of sex-biased alleles on the aphid X chromosome. We found that the X favourable spread of male-beneficial alleles in autosomes leads to the spread of sexual antagonistic genes in beneficial asexual females. We also found that male-biased gene expression evolves to solve conflicts raised by the spread and spread of sex antagonistic allele alleles, and that female-biased genes are enriched on autosomes. Our results suggest that the mechanisms of resolution and sexual antagonism lead to sex- biased gene expression, but argue hardly to explain the observed difference in X autosomes, and suggest that this study highlights the relevance of organisms displaying alternative mode of sex chromosome inheritance in understanding the forces shaping chromosome evolution."

The importance of chromatin remodelers in inducing structural changes to chromatin and, therefore, in controlling the expression of genes has recently resurfaced with the realization that several of them are mutated in human cancers. SNF5, which serves as the core subunit of the BAF remodeling complex, is one such remodeler. In this study, we identify the role of SNF5 induced chromatin remodeling in cell differentiation, the commitment of embryonic cells to a mature lineage-committed state. Importantly, we find that SNF5 establishes appropriate chromatin remodeling patterns during differentiation by controlling the levels of the OCT4 protein, the master determinant of the undifferentiated state. On receipt of differentiation cues, SNF5 opens the chromatin of repressed genes that are occupied by OCT4. SNF5 also induces the closing of genes that are being actively transcribed and OCT4 bound. Further, we show that SNF5 is necessary for cell survival during differentiation, highlighting its crucial role in the process. Together, our data shed novel insights on the importance of SNF5 in maintaining the balance between the embryonic and differentiated states.","Cell differentiation is a process in which the DNA is repressed by DNA regulatory regions, which is essential for cell survival and differentiation. Chromatin remodelers, BAF complexes, are responsible for establishing nucleosome occupancy patterns, which are key for epigenetic regulation of DNA methylation and histone modifications. In this study, we have assessed the roles of BAF complex subunits in stemness and differentiation in murine embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that SNF5, a core subunit of the BAFcomplex, negatively regulates OCT4 levels in pluripotent cells, and is critical for cell fate determination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this subunit is responsible for generating NDRs at regulatory sites of OCT4 repressed target genes, including PAX6 and NEUROG1, and crucial for gene fate determination in the cell. These results highlight the importance of SNFF5 in regulating the expression of genes activated by repressed OCT4."

Transmission of chikungunya virus in the U.S. is a major public health risk, especially in Florida where the environmental conditions are favorable for the two main mosquitoes involved in transmission. We measured susceptibility to infection and transmission for Florida Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes for two emergent strains of chikungunya virus (Indian Ocean and Asian strains). Both mosquito species showed high susceptibility to infection and rapid spread of the virus throughout the body of the mosquito, including the saliva for both emergent strains of chikungunya virus. Aedes albopictus had higher body infection and transmission of the Indian Ocean strain sooner after feeding on chikungunya virus infected blood than Ae. aegypti. Aedes aegypti had higher body infection and saliva infection later during infection with the Asian strain of chikungunya virus than Ae. albopictus. We also observed declines in body infection and transmission over time, suggesting that transmission risk declines with length of infection. The information here will be useful as parameters in models of risk of chikungunya virus transmission.","Chikungunya fever (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. In the United States, approximately 3,800 human cases of CHIKV have been reported in the last decade.

We found that the two mosquito species are more susceptible to infection and transmission of emergent lineages of chIKV, Indian Ocean (IOC) and Asian genotypes (AC) than the other two species. Viral dissemination of transmission of AC and AC was lower than that of the two species, suggesting that transmission risk declines over the length of infection. Interestingly, there was a reduction in transmission between AC and Ae. ae. albopsictus, suggesting older Ae.agypti females are relatively competent vectors similar to those of aged Ae. anbopictsus females. We also identified small-scale geographic variation in vector competence between Aedes and Ae. ane. and suggest that the differences in transmission risk between these two species may contribute to regional differences in the risk of CHikV transmission in Florida."

In support of this, we recently showed that chronic intestinal nematode infection resulted in reduced immune responses and higher mycobacterial burden at distal sites. How a gut-dwelling nematode modulate immune responses in skin-draining lymph nodes (LN) was not clear. We found a reduced expansion of LN draining the BCG injected footpad in worm-infected animals, but no evidence for a spread of regulatory cells or cytokines to the BCG-draining LN. Interestingly, we found that mice chronically infected with intestinal worms had significantly smaller skin-draining LN. We propose that the expansion of mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) occur at the cost of other LN, leading to atrophy of skin-draining LN. Expansion of the lymphocyte pool by IL-7, allowed worm-infected animals to maintain larger skin-draining LN while the mLN did not further expand. De-worming treatment of mice eventually restored the cellularity of skin-draining LN. This, however, took time indicating that effect of worms persisted long after the infection cleared. By de-worming and allowing time for the LN to recover, the cellular responses to BCG injection in the footpad were restored in the draining popliteal LN. Thus, paucity of lymphocytes at peripheral sites can explain impaired peripheral immune responses in worm-infected animals.","Intestinal nematodes suppress immune responses in the context of allergy, gut inflammation, and secondary infection. Several mechanisms have been proposed for suppression, including alterations in Th2 cell differentiation and increased Treg cell suppressive function. In this study, we found that chronic nematode infection leads to reduced peripheral responses to vaccination and a generalized reduction of the available responsive lymphocyte pool. We found that superficial skin-dwelling lymph nodes (LNs) in mice chronically infected with intestinal nematod Heligmosomides polygyrus, reach cellularity in worm-free mice and subsequent to BCG infection in skin. B cells and T cells, however, declined in skin-Dwelling LNs in H.polygyrus-infected mice, resulting in LNs atrophy and altered lymphocyte composition. Importantly, anti-helminthic treatment improved lymphocyte numbers in skin draining LNs, indicating that time de-worming is critical to regain-scale LN cellularity. De-wormming, when skin LN recover cellularity, mended responses to Bacille Calmette-Guin (BCG) at the LN draining footpad injection site. Our findings suggest that chronic parasitic nematoder infection may lead to a paucity of lymphocytes in peripheral lymph nodes, which acts to reduce efficacy of immune responses at these sites."

This increase correlates with a significant augment in the activity of HMGCoA reductase (the limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis), favoring a cholesterol-enriched cellular environment. The augment in the activity of the HMGCR observed in infected cells is caused by a decrease in the phosphorylation level of the HMGCR, associated with the inactivation of AMPK. In agreement, AMPK activation by metformin reduces HMGCR activity and affects viral replication. The role HMGCR and AMPK activity in DENV replicative complexes formation was confirmed by the co-localization of HMGCR and cholesterol with the viral proteins NS3, NS4A and E. Furthermore, metformin and lovastatin (HMGCR inhibitor) treatments altered this co-localization as well as replicative complexes formation supporting that active HMGCR is required for replicative complexes formation. The results show that during DENV infection, an increase in the HMGCR activity occurs through AMPK inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol levels in endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation.

Changes in lipid-related metabolites in the endoplasmic reticulum of dengue infected cells are associated with replicative complexes formation. Previously, it was reported that DENV infection inhibits HMGCR phosphorylation by generating a cholesterol-rich cellular environment in order to favor viral replication. In this work, enzymatic assays, ELISA, and WB found a significant increase in activity of HMG CR in DENV infected cells, associated with inactivation of the enzyme AMPK. AMPK activation and metformin declined HMGC activity, suggesting that AMPK inactivation mediates enhanced activity of the HMGR enzyme. Furthermore, the reduction of AMPK phosphorylated activity was observed in infected cells at 12 and 24 hpi. We also found that the increased activity of a protein called PP2A was mediated by the inhibition of the phosphatase, which is required for the formation of these complexes. These data suggest that DENVs infection increases HMGRC activity and AMPK activity leading to higher cholesterol levels in endoplasms and the formation and formation of the complexes. Our work provides new information about the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism and DENV replicative cycle and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication."

High DEK expression causes cancer related phenotypes such as increased cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Despite the well documented link between high DEK expression and cancer, the consequences of Dek overexpression in vivo are poorly understood. To determine if Dek contributes to carcinogenesis in vivo, we generated a Dek inducible transgenic mouse model wherein Dek can be overexpressed in specific tissues and inhibited with the drug doxycycline. We targeted Dek overexpression to keratinocytes, the cell of origin for squamous cell carcinoma, and exposed the mice to the chemical carcinogen 4NQO to induce oral cavity and esophageal carcinogenesis. We found that DEK overexpression was sufficient to increase gross esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence and caused a trend toward increased cellular proliferation in adjacent non-tumor tissue. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that Dek overexpression specifically targeted to basal keratinocytes is sufficient to promote cellular and squamous cell carcinoma growth in vivo.","Esophageal cancer is caused by squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma. ESCCs comprise 90% of cases worldwide, and recur 15% to 15% of the year survival rate despite the available treatments. The identification of new ESCC drivers and therapeutic targets is critical for improving outcomes. We report that the expression of a human DEK oncogene is strongly upregulated in esophagesal SCC based on data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). The DEK chromatin-associated protein plays important roles in many nuclear processes including gene transcription, epigenetics, DNA repair, and DNA repair. Our previous data utilized a murine knockout model to demonstrate that Dek overexpression in human keratinocytes, the cell origin of SCC, is sufficient to cause hyperplasia in 3D organotypic raft cultures that mimic human skin, linking high DEK expression to keratinocyte oncogenic phenotypes. However, the role of DEK-expression in ESCC development remains unknown in human cells and genetic mouse models. In order to define the consequences of Dek overexression in vivo, we generated a validated tetracycline responsive Dek transgenic mouse model referred to Bi-L-Dek. We show that high Dek expression induced a trend of hyperplasticity in the 3D raft cultures of human skin. Furthermore, high levels of Dek expression in keratin cells were associated with the trend of esophageaal hyperplasia in 4NQO treated mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate that high levels in Dek in cell origin and SCC are sufficient to promote the development of ESCC in vivo."

When placed in an evolutionary context, the details of the genotype-to-phenotype model can impact the maintenance of genetic variation for complex traits. Likewise, non-equilibrium demographic history may affect patterns of genetic variation. Here, we explore the impact of genetic model and population growth on distribution of genetic variance across the allele frequency spectrum underlying risk for a complex disease. Using forward-in-time population genetic simulations, we show that the genetic model has important impacts on the composition of variation for complex disease risk in a population. We explicitly simulate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and perform heritability estimation on population samples. A particular model of gene-based partial recessivity, based on allelic non-complementation, aligns well with empirical results. This model is congruent with the dominance variance estimates from both SNPs and twins, and the minor allele frequency distribution of GWAS hits.","The genetic component of complex disease risk in humans remains largely unexplained. Theoretical models relate population genetic processes and maintenance of genetic variation to quantitative traits, which suggest profitable avenues for future experimental design.

Furthermore, our model predicts considerable levels of unexplained variance associated with intralocus epistasis. These results suggest the need for improved statistical tools for region based genetic association and heritability estimation."

Accessory functions could serve as an arsenal enabling prokaryotes to develop adaptations to new niches. Therefore, prokaryotic core and accessory components are analogous to the operating system and applications (apps) of smartphones. However, it is puzzling how these accessory functions are linked with the core regulatory network in prokaryotes during niche adaptations. Here we address this question by investigating the adaptive regulation of hierarchical core/accessory subsets in the multipartite pangenome (chromosome, chromid and plasmid) of Sinorhizobium fredii, which is a facultative microsymbiont of soybeans. The level and variation of gene expression, and gene connectivity revealed in transcriptomes under free-living and symbiotic conditions are positively correlated with the gene conservation level, i.e. from strain-specific accessory genes to genus core. Replicon-dependent organization and adaptive regulation of hierarchical core/accessory subsets suggest distinct roles of different replicons not only in environmental adaptation but also intra- and inter-species differentiation. Among core and accessory genes with host-specific upregulation patterns, we experimentally identified novel symbiotic players involved in host-specific adaptation.","Prokaryotes benefit from having accessory genes, but it is unclear how accessory genes are linked to the core regulatory network in developing adaptations to new niches. We determined the hierarchical core/attribution components of the multipartite pangenome of the soybean microsymbiont Sinorhizobium fredii comparing the genomes of S.fredii strains in mid-log stationary growth phases and symbiotic conditions. The average level of gene expression, variation in expression, and gene conservation was positively correlated with gene conservation. We found that the pangensome subsets of shared strains were enriched for accessory genes and chromid genes. Proportionally chromid and plasmid genes were co-expressing chromosomal genes, plasmids genes were higher-replicon connectivity and expression of chromid ones, and the key nitrogen fixation genes in symbiosis with the Plasmid was characterized high connectivity within-re replicon analyses. These genes were also associated with host-specific upregulation patterns, and chromosomal znu mdt operons, encoding a conserved high-affinity zinc transporter and an accessory multi-drug efflux system, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of integrative regulation of hierarchical core and accessory components in multipartites in bacteria niche adaptation and shaping the prokaryotic pangeneome in the long run."

Some of the most studied ICEs belong to the SXT/R391 family, which are major drivers of multidrug resistance dissemination among various pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria. Transfer of SXT/R391 ICEs to a new host first requires its excision from the chromosome as a circular molecule, which may be lost if the cell divides. In silico analyses revealed several putative stabilization systems carried by R391, a prototypical member of the SXT/R391 ICEs family originally isolated from Providencia rettgeri. We discovered that, besides stabilization by integration into the chromosome, stability of SXT/R391 ICEs also depends on toxin/antitoxin systems and plasmid-like features including intracellular replication and active partition. Thus, although it has been known for a long time that ICEs and conjugative plasmids use similar strategies to transfer between bacterial populations, our work reveals additional unforeseen similarities in their mechanisms of maintenance in the host cell.","Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs) of the SXT/R391 family disseminate multidrug resistance to pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria Vibrio cholerae. ICEs are mobile genetic elements that reside on the chromosome of the host and eventually self-transfer to the bacteria through conjugation. Conjugation involves a transient extrachromosomal circular plasmid-like form thought to be a substrate for single-stranded DNA translocation to the recipient cell and mating pore. However, the plasmids are thought non-replicative and consequently expected to be highly unstable. We investigated the genetic determinants contributing to the stability of ICEs. We found that a hipAB-like toxin/antoxin system improves R391 stability and deletion of traI resulted in a tenfold increase in R391 loss. Furthermore, we uncovered a conserved locus coding for a distantly related type II (actin-type ATPase) parMRC partitioning system that contributes to the loss of conjugative transfer. These findings suggest that the partitioning systems usually stabilize low-copy plasmide ICEs, but srpMRC is reported to be active in reducing the loss."

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a biophysical technique that is the gold standard to reveal parameters governing biochemical and biophysical reaction. However, ITC requires large amount of proteins for analysis. As large quantities of full-length recombinant HIV Pr55Gag proteins have not been available in the past 30 years due to technical limitation, a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of full-length HIV Pr55Gag has not been possible. Here, we have generated sufficient amount of full-length recombinant HIV Pr55Gag protein for isothermal titration calorimetry analysis. Our analyses have shown that the major interactions amongst HIV proteins and RNA sequences during viral assembly are energetically favourable reactions. In other words, HIV Pr55Gag proteins and viral RNA have evolved to overcome the energy barrier for virus formation by utilising energy obtained from protein-RNA interactions in order to facilitate the viral assembly process. Furthermore, HIV also use the oligomeric states of HIV Pr55Gag proteins and the RNA sequences as means to regulate the viral assembly process.","Pr55Gag is an RNA polymerase that is required for the assembly of HIV genomes. In order to assemble HIV genomes, it is necessary to bind the RNA of the virus to the DNA of the host.

We showed that binding to RNA of HIV Pr55Gags is an energetically favourable reaction (ΔG<0) and enhanced oligomerization of Pr55gag. The change in enthalpy ( ΔH) widens sequentially: (1) RNA binding to the HIV genome selection; (2) RNA-Guanosine Uridine (GU)-containing RNA binding in the cytoplasm/ plasma membrane; and (3) RNA–Adenosine(A)-containing mRNA binding in immature HIV.

Based on the latest human genetic leprosy susceptibility research and mouse infection models, we generated a double knockout mouse strain (10NOS2−/−) which has deficiencies in two key immune factors, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2). We investigated the dynamics of the immune response to Mycobacterium leprae infection and chronicled the types of immune cells recruited to the site of infection. 10NOS2−/− mice developed a substantial induration in response to infection, as well as an increased interferon-gamma response to components of the leprosy bacillus. Interestingly, these animals also exhibited CD4+ T cell infiltration into the nerves, a phenomenon which has not been previously reported in leprosy mouse models.

Recently we identified a gene encoded by EBV, BNLF2a, that when expressed ectopically in cells inhibited their recognition by CD8+ T cells. To determine the contribution of BNLF2a to evasion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cell recognition and whether EBV encoded additional immune evasion mechanisms, a recombinant EBV was constructed in which BNLF2a was deleted. We found that cells infected with the recombinant virus were better recognized by CD8+ T cells specific for targets expressed co-incidently with BNLF2a, compared to cells infected with a non-recombinant virus. However, proteins expressed at late stages of the viral infection cycle were poorly recognised by CD8+ T cells, suggesting EBV encodes additional immune evasion genes to prevent effective CD8+ T cell recognition. This study highlights the stage-specific nature of viral immune evasion mechanisms.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that infects millions of people worldwide.

We have recently identified an immune evasion protein encoded by EBV, BNLF2a, which is expressed in the early phase of lytic replication and inhibits the peptide-ATP-binding functions of the transporter associated with antigen processing. Ectopic expression of EBV causes decreased surface MHC class expression and inhibits presentation of the indicator antigens of CD8 + T cells in EBV-transmitted cells.

Such expansion of a family of pathways requires two main evolutionary processes—acquisition of additional copies of the pathway's genes and divergence of interaction specificity to prevent cross-talk between pathways while preserving interactions within each copy of the pathway. In bacteria, acquisition can occur horizontally, by transfer between different lineages, or vertically, by duplication within the lineage. Interaction specificity is thought to diverge through a promiscuous intermediate component that prevents loss of interaction during the process. In this work, we study the mechanisms underlying the extreme expansion of the Rap-Phr cell–cell signaling family in the Bacillus genus. Specificity of Rap-Phr interaction is critical for guiding preferential action towards kin. We find that horizontal transfer and not duplication guides the acquisition of an already divergent Rap-Phr variant. Surprisingly, duplication still has a key role during expansion, as duplication and subsequent divergence of the signaling molecule gene provide the promiscuous intermediate state needed for divergence of specificity. We therefore identify two complementary roles for horizontal and vertical processes in the evolution of social bacterial pathways.","Evolutionary expansion of signaling pathway families underlies the evolution of regulatory complexity. This expansion requires acquisition of a novel homologous pathway and diversification of pathway specificity. This acquisition can occur vertically, duplication, horizontal transfer, and divergence specificity is thought to occur at a promiscuous protein intermediate. However, the way mechanisms that shape evolution of rapidly diverging signaling families remain unclear. Here, we examine the question of whether the highly diversified Rap-Phr cell–cell signaling system, which has undergone massive expansion in the genus Bacillus, has undergone a massive expansion within the genus. We show that this expansion occurred independently of multiple Bacilli lineages, and >80 different putative rap- phr alleles evolving in the Bacillius subtilis group have been experimentally demonstrated. Strikingly, horizontal gene transfer governs the acquisition of diverged rap-phr alleles, intralocus duplication and divergence of the phr gene to create an intermediate that is required for the divergence of specificity. These results suggest a novel role for transient gene duplication divergence and evolutionary shifts in specificity."

Addressing this question, we detect positive selection in the promoter regions of three tandem A. halleri HMA4 paralogs, which are uniformly cis-activated. The accompanying hard selective sweep, however, is segmentally eclipsed as a consequence of recurrent ectopic gene conversion among HMA4 protein-coding sequences, which undergo concerted evolution.

Compared to control loci flanking tandem HMA2 gene copies, gradual depletion of nucleotide sequences and excess of low-frequency polymorphisms hallmarks positive selection of HMA3 promoter regions, culminating in HMA-3-3. These findings constitute an unexpectedly complex profile of polymorphism resulting from natural selection and increased gene product dosage. We propose that these findings constitute a paradigmatic category of multi-copy genes in a broad range of organisms."

We have asked the question how these parasites actually manage to swim and manoeuver in an environment that is so amazingly crowded by blood cells and that reveals rapidly varying fluid flow speeds that are 50–20.000 times faster than the trypanosome's swimming speed. Our experiments suggest an astute mechanism by which trypanosomes have perfectly adapted to their hostile microenvironment. We found that the pathogens can readily adjust the beating direction of their single flagellum in response to purely mechanical cues. In the blood they exploit the spacing and shape of blood cells for very efficient forward movement that is required for host antibody clearance. When the parasites get trapped, i.e. in the extracellular matrix, they reverse the beating direction and consequently move backwards. The mechanism of flagellar beat switch is unique in nature and represents a genetically fixed trypanosome virulence factor. By introducing innovative technological advances, we have been able to quantify this complex cell behavior with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. These include the first numerical simulation of a cell of this complexity, extending the protozoans suitability as a model organism for the regulation of flagellar and ciliary motility.","African trypanosomes are strictly extracellular blood parasites, which evade the immune response system by antigenic variation and incessant motility. How these parasites actually swim in blood remains elucidated. In this study, we used high-speed fluorescence microscopy to study the mode of motility of the parasites in blood. We found that the mode dynamics of the parasite mode motility was adapted to the density of cells in the blood. The parasites were pulled forward by a planar beat of a single flagellum. The presence of particles shape, size, and spacing of blood cells required sufficient for the parasites to reach maximum forward velocity. The density of these obstacles, which increased resemble collagen networks in tissue spaces, caused parasites to reverse the flagella beat and consequently swim backwards, in a way avoiding getting trapped. In the absence of obstacles, the parasites reverse the beat and reversal occurs randomly resulting in irregular waveforms and apparent cell tumbling. This is a surprising example of micro-adaptation to life in low Reynolds numbers. The precise physical interpretation, compare high-resolution microscopic data results in a simulation technique that combines a method of multi-part collision dynamics and a triangulated surface model. The simulation produces a rotating cell body helical swimming path, providing a functioning simulation method for microorganism and a complex swimming strategy."

However, despite many clues, we understand little about how memory storage and retrieval is implemented in neural circuits. In particular, while many previous studies considered the amount of information that can be stored in synaptic connections under biological constraints on the dynamic range of synapses, how much of this information can be successfully recovered by neural dynamics during memory retrieval remains unclear. Here, we use a top-down approach to address this question: we assume memories are laid down in bounded synapses by biologically relevant plasticity rules and then derive from first principles how the neural circuit should behave during recall in order to retrieve these memories most efficiently. We show that the resulting recall dynamics are consistent with a wide variety of properties of hippocampal area CA3, across a range of biophysical levels – from synapses, through neurons, to circuits. Furthermore, our approach allows us to make novel and experimentally testable predictions about the link between the structure, dynamics, and function of CA3 circuitry.","Memories stored in the hippocampus are stored in a dynamical range of synapses. However, it is not clear how these synapses function in memory retrieval. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for memory storage in bounded synapses, which is based on the notion of metaplasticity. We use this framework to develop a probabilistic inference problem, and derive neural dynamics to implement approximate inference algorithms to solve the problem efficiently. In particular, we demonstrate that time memories efficiently read biologically plausible network dynamics and are completely constrained by the synaptic plasticity rule, and that statistics of stored patterns of the recall cue can be used to predict future memory retrieval events. Our theory organises a coherent framework for a wide range of existing data regulation, excitability, feedback inhibition, network oscillations, and area of CA3, and makes novel directly testable predictions to guide future experiments."

Identifying c-MYC target genes is one of the key steps to understand both the biological role and molecular mechanism of c-MYC action. Defining the complete list of c-MYC target genes and categorizing them as genes that are directly and indirectly modulated remains a challenge. Computational models also help us to understand the mechanisms modulating c-MYC function. We describe a method to predict where MYC will bind in the genome and which c-MYC binding sites will be biologically active. The method integrates multiple sources of data, including both genome sequence and functional annotations, to predict that 460 genes are direct c-MYC targets. These include many genes previously known to be c-MYC targets as well as 245 novel direct c-MYC targets. Using multiple, independent gene-expression datasets improves the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction and demonstrates significant tissue-specific variation in c-MYC action at different genes. Our study suggests that chromatin state plays an important role in modulating both c-MYC binding-site activity and the functional consequences of c-MYC binding.","C-MYC is a nuclear sequence specific –binding DNA-binding proteins that are pleiotropic regulators of cellular function. It has been deregulated and/or mutated in human cancers. Experimental studies of MYC binding to the genome have not been fully consistent. Here, we develop a computational model to predict c-myC binding sites in the human genome. We use a Bayesian network classifier to predict which genes are likely to be regulated by MYC in vivo. The classifier incorporates genomic sequence, experimentally determined genomic chromatin acetylation islands, and predicted methylation status in the computational model. We find that the predictions of the classifier are applicable to transcription factors, cAMP-response element-binding protein, and binding sites sensitive to DNA methylation. Second, our predictions are combined with gene expression profile data and independent microarray datasets from multiple tissues. Finally, we consider gene function annotations and Gene Ontology to predict the c-MYc targets. We assess the performance of our prediction results by comparing the results comparing c-Myc targets identified in the biomedical literature. Overall, we predict 460 likely c- MYC target genes to be expressed in the whole human genome, 67 reported to be bound to regulated MYC, 68 bound to MYC and 80 MYC-regulated.

The selection process entails a decision about which object is favoured by the available evidence over time. This period of time is typically in the range of hundreds of milliseconds and is widely believed to be crucial for decisions, allowing neurons to filter noise in the evidence. Despite the widespread belief that time plays this role in decisions and the growing recognition that the brain estimates elapsed time during perceptual tasks, few studies have considered how the encoding of time effects decision making. We propose that neurons encode time in this range by the same general mechanisms used to select objects for detailed processing, and that these temporal representations determine how long evidence is filtered. To this end, we simulate a perceptual decision by coupling two instances of a neural network widely used to simulate localized regions of the cerebral cortex. One network encodes the passage of time and the other makes decisions based on noisy evidence. The former influences the performance of the latter, reproducing signature characteristics of temporal estimates and perceptual decisions.","We show that local cortical circuits are inherently suited to relevant spatial temporal coding. We use a generic local-circuit model to encode time ‘climbing’ activity, as seen in cortex tasks with a timing requirement. We show that this model can be used to simulate pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, connected to conductance synapses. This simple learning rule enables the network to quickly produce new interval estimates, signature characteristics, and estimates of experimental subjects’ decision times. Analysis of network dynamics formally characterizes a generic, local-Circuit timing mechanism. In simulations of a perceptual decision task, we show that the timing network learns longer intervals, driving the rate of downstream decision processing and spatially non-selective input, as established by a form of gain modulation. Like timing network interval estimates and decision times, decision times have signature characteristics in experimental subjects. Overall, we propose, we demonstrate that the generic mechanism of timing, a generic mechanism for modulation of decision processing, and predictions of experimental verification are consistent with experimental verification."

Yet, a much larger group– 2 billion people–harbors latent TB infection (LTBI) without clinical symptoms, but at lifelong risk of reactivation. The physiological niches of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persistence remain incompletely defined and both pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites have been proposed. Adipose tissue constitutes 15–25% of total body mass and is an active production site for hormones and inflammatory mediators. The increasing prevalence of obesity, has led to greater incidence of type 2 diabetes. These patients suffer from three times higher risk of developing TB, pointing to a potential link between adipose tissue and TB pathogenesis. In individuals with LTBI, Mtb survives in a stressed, non-replicating state with low metabolic activity and resting macrophages serve as preferred habitat and become effectors after appropriate stimulation. Here we demonstrate that Mtb can infect and persist within adipocytes where it upregulates stress-related genes. In vivo, relative proportions of leukocyte subsets infiltrating adipose tissue varied under different conditions of infection. During natural aerosol Mtb infection, distinct leukocyte subsets, including mononuclear phagocytes, Mtb-specific CD8+ T cells and NK cells infiltrated adipose tissue and became activated. Thus, our study shows that adipose tissue is not only a potential reservoir for this pathogen but also undergoes significant alteration during TB infection.","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) primarily resides in the lung and can persist in extrapulmonary sites. Macrophages are considered the prime cellular habitat of Mtb. In this study, we demonstrate that Mtb resides inside adipose tissue and expresses stress-related genes. We show that perigonadal fat from Mtb-infected mice is disseminated during infection and transferred to uninfected animals. Adipose tissue harbors leukocytes in addition to adipocytes and cell types observed during Mtb infection. Mice infected with the aerosol showed infiltration of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1 (Arg1)-negative F4/80+ cells, despite recruitment of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

However, most of these studies are cross-sectional and lack a mechanistic understanding of this ecosystem's structure and its response to external perturbations, therefore not allowing accurate temporal predictions. In this article, we develop a method to analyze temporal community data accounting also for time-dependent external perturbations. In particular, this method combines the classical Lotka–Volterra model of population dynamics with regression techniques to obtain mechanistically descriptive coefficients which can be further used to construct predictive models of ecosystem dynamics. Using then data from a mouse experiment under antibiotic perturbations, we are able to predict and recover the microbiota temporal dynamics and study the concept of alternative stable states and antibiotic-induced transitions. As a result, our method reveals a group of commensal microbes that potentially protect against infection by the pathogen Clostridium difficile and proposes a possible mechanism how the antibiotic makes the host more susceptible to infection.","The gut microbiota is an important part of the human health system. Understanding how the microbiota confers resistance to enteric pathogens and how antibiotics disrupt resistance is key for the prevention and cure of intestinal infections. We present a novel method to infer microbial community ecology directly from time-resolution metagenomics. Our method extends generalized Lotka–Volterra dynamics to account for external perturbations. Data from recent experiments with antibiotic-mediated Clostridium difficile infection were analyzed to quantify microbial interactions, commensal-pathogen interactions, and the effect of the antibiotic on the microbial community. Stability analysis reveals that the microbiota is intrinsically stable, explaining why antibiotic perturbation can produce catastrophic shifts that persist after removal of perturbative perturbators. Importantly, our analysis suggests that a subnetwork of bacterial groups is implicated in protection against C. difficiles. Our generality, method extends to high-resolution ecological time-series data to infer community structure in response to external stimuli."

Yet, it has been repeatedly suggested, based almost exclusively studies in few model species, that such bacteria are less diverse and engage in fewer genetic exchanges. Here, we reverse the current paradigm and show that bacteria encoding capsules have larger and more diverse gene repertoires, which change faster by horizontal gene transfer and recombination. Our study alters the traditional view of the capsule as a barrier to gene flow and raises novel questions about the role of capsules in bacterial adaptation.","Capsules allow bacteria to colonize novel environments, withstand numerous stresses, and resist antibiotics. However, genetic exchanges between cells under adaptive circumstances, suggested that capsules have lower rates of homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer. We analysed pan- genomes of thousands of bacterial genomes and found evidence of an association between genetic exchanges (or lack thereof) and the presence of a capsule system. We found that bacteria encoding capsules have larger pan-genomes, higher rates of horizontal gene exchange, and higher rates for homologs and recombination in core genomes. Accordingly, genomes encoding capsules contain more plasmids, conjugative elements, transposases, prophages, integrons, and integrons. Furthermore, the capsular loci are frequent in plasmid-containing bacteria, and are found in prophage-producing bacteria. These results are valid for Bacteria, independently of their ability to be naturally transformable."

The first step in the transmission process consists of the mosquitoes seeking and finding a host. Mosquitoes use the wind direction and odors, such as carbon dioxide, emitted by the hosts in order to locate a host to bite. We present a spatial computational model of the host-seeking process in a region where hosts are heterogeneously distributed in clusters. The model is used to analyze the success in finding hosts once the mosquitoes are close to the host. We show that the number of mosquito-host contacts increases as hosts become more widely spaced within their clusters; that mosquito flight perpendicular to the wind leads to greater success in locating a host; and that the number of bites per host decreases when hosts aggregate into larger clusters.","Mosquito host-seeking behavior and heterogeneity in host distribution are important factors in predicting the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne infections such as dengue fever, malaria, chikungunya, and West Nile virus.

The model includes odor plumes generated by spatially distributed hosts, wind velocity, and mosquito behavior based on the prevailing wind odor plume. We compare the effectiveness of different plume-finding and plume tracking strategies that mosquitoes use to locate their host. Our results show that different models of mosquito behavior are capable of producing comparable results given appropriate parameter choices and host finding success. We also assess the impact of changing level of host aggregation on mosquito host-finding success near the end of host- seeking flight. We show that clusters of hosts are tightly associated with smaller patches, and the biting rate of the host decreased. These results suggest that the spatial arrangement of individuals is important for mosquito behavior."

In the process, it increases genetic diversity through recombination of homologous chromosomes from the parents. Genetic diversity constitutes an evolutionary advantage. Prior to finding their unique pairing partner (homolog), chromosomes associate non-homologously with other chromosomes through their centromeres, a process termed centromere coupling. Little is known about the nature and mechanism of centromere coupling. In this study, we present the first pairwise characterization of this process conserved amongst eukaryotes, using the budding yeast as a model. We quantitatively analyzed the interactions between centromeres for each pair of chromosomes. We observed an interaction pattern based on chromosome size, where centromeres from smaller chromosomes frequently associated with those from other small chromosomes, and a similar association for large chromosomes. This pattern appears ubiquitous, since recombination-defective diploid cells, haploid cells forced to undergo meiosis, and wild-type yeast early in meiosis, until homologous chromosomes become paired, all undergo non-homologous centromere coupling. Centromeres derived from a common ancestor, prior to genome duplication, do not associate more often, excluding ancestral homology as the mechanism. Data from mutants affecting the meiotic bouquet, where all chromosome ends become embedded and clustered in the nuclear envelope prior to coupling, suggest a potential mechanism to generate interactions. Deciphering the mechanisms for proper pairing of homologous chromosomes helps us to understand and prevent chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancy.","During meiosis, chromosomes undergo a homology search in order to locate a homolog and form stable pairs to exchange genetic material. Early in meiosis the chromosomes associate with non-homologous pairs, tethered to centromeres. This phenomenon, conserved in higher eukaryotes, is termed centromere coupling. In budding yeast, the initiation of recombination in the presence of homologs is dispensable. In haploid diploid yeast, a synaptonemal complex (SC) protein Zip1 is required. The nature of the mechanism of coupling is not elucidated. We present a pairwise analysis of the interaction pattern in S. cerevisiae to uncover the underlying rules that exist for the interaction of non-heterologous and centromeric chromosomes. We found that the size-dependent interaction pattern is established by establishing a size dependence on centromer coupling. Coupling spo11 and ndj1 follows telomere clustering preferences. We propose that chromosome size preference is a mechanism that helps establish efficient homolog recognition."

Most small molecules can interact with other macromolecules in the cell ‘nonspecifically,’ i.e., with significantly lower affinity. The extent to which these nonspecific interactions influence the availability and action of the drug for its specific target depends upon the relative concentrations of drug, the specific target, and nonspecific targets. The structure of the cell is quite crowded with a highly non-uniform distribution of macromolecules that can interact with the drug of interest both specifically and nonspecifically. Thus, some compartments or micro-domains within the cell may have a comparatively high concentration of nonspecific targets, sufficient to trap the drug and retard its diffusion toward the specific target. Here, using small-molecule binding to DNA and single cell monitoring, we demonstrate that this effect results in apparently anomalous small molecule-DNA binding kinetics in cells at rates that are 1000-fold slower than in a homogeneous, dilute, aqueous environment. This slow intracellular diffusion, however, has an advantageous consequence: it leads to virtually irreversible binding of the small molecule (drug) to specific DNA targets in cells. We study and quantify the effect of nonspecific interactions between small DNA-binding molecules, including known DNA-binding drugs, in different cellular compartments in order to identify factors that account for the variability in binding kinetics among individual cells.","Drug-target interactions in the microenvironment of a cell complex are generally defined as simple diffusion and intrinsic chemical reactivity. Non-specific interactions between drugs and macromolecules in cells are rarely considered in terms of formally assessing pharmacodynamics. Here, we show that non-specific interaction can lead to slow incorporation of the kinetics of DNA binding drugs into cells. We observe a rate of drug incorporation in cell nuclei orders of magnitude slower than in vitro anomalous drug diffusion in cells. This slow diffusion, however, is an advantageous consequence: it leads to virtually irreversible binding of drug specific DNA targets to cells. Our results provide a comprehensive model of intracellular diffusion of small-molecule drugs, target-seeking trajectories, and the consequences of the apparent kinetics and processes of drug-target interaction."

Although podoconiosis is one of the major causes of lower leg swelling worldwide, understanding of the geographical distribution of the disease is incomplete. In Cameroon, few studies have been conducted, and these have indicated varied and localized distribution of the disease. We conducted this countrywide mapping survey to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon. We undertook nationwide mapping of podoconiosis in Cameroon by surveying 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households, in 76 communities. During the survey, individuals with lymphedema underwent a rapid-format antigen antibody test, and a thick blood film (TBF) for microscopic examination, as a confirmatory tool for detecting W. bancrofti micro filarial. Peripheral night blood and parasite DNA detection was used to exclude lymphatic filariasis, and a clinical history and physical examination was conducted to diagnosis podoconiosis. The overall prevalence of podoconiosis was found to be  0.5%. At least one case of podoconiosis was found in every region of Cameroon except Adamawa, where in the two surveyed villages no cases of podoconiosis were identified. Our investigation has demonstrated low prevalence but almost nationwide distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon. Designing a podoconiosis control program is a vital next step. A health system response to the burden of podoconiosis is important, through case surveillance and morbidity management services.","Podoconiosis is non-filarial elephantiasis, which causes massive swelling of the lower legs and lower legs.

Understanding the functional roles, evolution, and population dynamics of TEs is essential to understanding genome evolution and function. Much of our knowledge about TE population dynamics and evolution comes from the studies of TEs in Drosophila. However, the adaptive importance of TEs in the Drosophila genome has never been assessed. In this work, we describe the first comprehensive genome-wide screen for recent adaptive TE insertions in D. melanogaster. Using several independent criteria, we identified a set of 13 adaptive TEs and estimate that 25–50 TEs have played adaptive roles since the migration of D. melanogaster out of Africa. We show that most of these adaptive TEs are likely to be involved in regulatory changes and appear to be involved in adaptation to the temperate climate. We argue that most identified adaptive TEs are destined to be lost from the D. melanogaster population but that they do contribute significantly to local adaptation in this species.","Transposable elements (TEs) are known to be potent sources of mutation, but their contribution to the generation of recent adaptive changes has not been systematically assessed.

They infect over 200 million people in more than 70 countries and cause severe and chronic disability. Snails naturally vary in resistance to this parasite even within species, so bolstering snail resistance in the wild would block transmission. We artificially selected snails for resistance and observed a rapid evolutionary response, with the greatest change occurring in the same genomic region in two independent trials. We subsequently confirmed that the selected haplotype conveys resistance to infection by schistosomes. The extraordinarily high sequence divergence among haplotypes in this region appears to be elevated due to ongoing natural selection, likely via host-parasite co-evolution. We observed the highest variation in genes encoding putative parasite recognition proteins, suggesting that these control the resistance phenotype in a manner reminiscent of immune gene complexes in other taxa. Thus, this gene cluster presents a potential new target to interfere with parasite transmission at the vector stage.","Schistosomiasis, a neglected global pandemic, is curtailed by blocking the transmission of the parasite to intermediate hosts, aquatic snails. Elucidating the genetic basis of snail-schistosome interaction is a key strategy to control transmission. Here, we map the natural parasite-resistance polymorphism in the Caribbean population of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata. Using independent experimental evolution lines, RAD genotyping shows that the genomic region responds to selection for resistance to the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. The dominant allele of the dominant allele conveys an 8-fold decrease in odds of infection. We also show that a <1Mb region, the Guadeloupe Resistance Complex (GRC), has 15 coding genes. Seven of these genes are single-pass transmembrane proteins that play putative immunological roles, and strikingly high nonsynonymous divergence (5-10%) in alleles. High linkage disequilibrium in intermediate-frequency ( >25%) haplotypes of GRC, a significantly non-neutral pattern, suggests that balancing selection maintains diversity in the GRC. This GRC resembles immune gene complexes seen in taxa likely involved in parasite recognition."

With support of international donors the country’s integrated Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) program has recently achieved 100% geographical coverage for mass drug administration in districts endemic for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. From 1975 to 1991 onchocerciasis control in Côte d’Ivoire was based on weekly aerial spraying of insecticide on targeted rivers. From 1992 to present, community directed treatment with ivermectin by community drug distributors was implemented in most endemic areas. Although the country experienced periods of civil disturbance that interrupted distribution of ivermectin for several years, significant progress was made during this time toward onchocerciasis elimination. There have been significant reductions in both microfilarial prevalences and community microfilarial loads in sentinel villages that had implementation of vector control and/or mass drug administration coverage rates of at least 65%. Although onchocerciasis persists in some areas, changes in management of the programme in 2015 together with improved political stability and increased support from key donors may lead to its elimination over the next 10 years.","Onchocerciasis control in Côte d’Ivoire started aerial insecticide spraying in 1974 and continued community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTi) from 1992 to 2016.

In an attempt to identify new potential drug targets, we focused our research on Leishmania donovani argininosuccinate synthase (LdASS), which is more highly expressed in the virulent form of the parasite. Using two cell lines that over expressed the wild type or a mutant form of LdASS, we demonstrated that LdASS has argininosuccinate synthase activity, which is absent in the mutant form containing the G128S point mutation. Infection of mice with the cell line over expressing a mutant LdASS had a negative dominant effect as indicated by the reduction in parasite load. LdASS is localized to large cytosolic complexes and a small portion is in a new vesicular subset different from the known glycosomes. Thus LdASS constitutes a new virulence factor that may be a potential drug target.","Leishmania donovani (Ld) is one of the most abundant amastigotes in the world. Ld is expressed in the urea cycle enzyme, argininosuccinate synthase, which is abundantly expressed in amastigen and promastigote. In order to characterize the detail of the newly identified protein in Leishmania, we determined its enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, and its ability to affect virulence in vivo. We found that LdASS is a mutant form of Ld that is associated with severe cases of citrullinemia in humans. In addition, we produced bacterially expressed recombinant forms of these proteins. Our results demonstrated that the enzyme is inactive and that the enzymatically activity of the enzyme was abolished by an ASS specific inhibitor (MDLA: methyl-D-L-Aspartic acid). Furthermore, the mutant form protein was inactive in BALB/c mice and demonstrated significant reduction in parasite load in the spleen and liver. Based on these observations, we propose that the active enzyme is a unique localization essential for parasite survival and growth in the mammalian host."

Even though neuroimaging techniques are helpful in determining the brain areas involved in speech recognition, there are rarely mechanistic explanations at a neuronal level. Here, we assume that songbirds and humans solve a very similar task: extracting information from sound wave modulations produced by a singing bird or a speaking human. Given strong evidence that both humans and songbirds, although genetically very distant, converged to a similar solution, we combined the vast amount of neurobiological findings for songbirds with nonlinear dynamical systems theory to develop a hierarchical, Bayesian model which explains fundamental functions in recognition of sound sequences. We found that the resulting model is good at learning and recognizing human speech. We suggest that this translated model can be used to qualitatively explain or predict experimental data, and the underlying mechanism can be used to construct improved automatic speech recognition algorithms.","The human brain uses computational principles to learn to recognize sound sequences, especially speech, but the exact means by which humans recognize speech is scarce in experimental findings at the neuronal, microscopic level. Here, we present a computational model of human speech learning. We show that the human brain can learn to decode complex auditory input, in an online fashion, by translating a birdsong model into a novel human sound learning recognition model. We find that the brain uses a Bayesian model hierarchy of nonlinear dynamical systems to learn speech samples and rapidly recognize robustly, under adverse conditions. In addition, the recognition performed by words spoken by different speakers and different accents—the everyday situation in which current state-of-the-art speech recognition models fail—to qualitatively explain behavioral data and derive predictions for future experiments."

It can lead to serious complications as well as many sequelae in young vulnerable patients and children. There are few works published in the literature concerning clinical, epidemiological, prognostic and therapeutic features of acute juvenile PCM. This study aims to describe a 9-year cohort study of patients with acute juvenile PCM from a reference center in the endemic area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Results demonstrate that early diagnosis can prevent poor outcomes and that a specialized medical structure is required to promote proper healthcare for these patients. Severe outcomes such as low adrenal reserve and a death occurred in 4 and 1 patients, respectively.

Due to their repetitive nature, LINEs are hard to grasp. In particular, we find that pervasive transcription is a major confounding factor in transcriptome data. We observe that, on average, more than 90% of LINE signal derives from pervasive transcription. To investigate this issue, we developed and validated a new method called TeXP. TeXP accounts and removes the effects of pervasive transcription when quantifying LINE activity. Our method uses the broad distribution of LINEs to estimate the effects of pervasive transcription. Using TeXP, we processed thousands of transcriptome datasets to uniformly, and unbiasedly measure LINE-1 activity across healthy somatic cells. By removing the pervasive transcription component, we find that (1) LINE-1 is broadly expressed in healthy somatic tissues; (2) Adult brain show small levels of LINE transcription and; (3) LINE-1 transcription level is correlated with tissue cell turnover. Our method thus offers insights into how repetitive sequences and influenced by pervasive transcription. Moreover, we uncover the activity of LINE-1 in somatic tissues at an unmatched scale.","Long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) is the primary source of genetic variation in humans and mammals. Despite its importance, LINE-1 activity remains difficult to study because of its highly repetitive nature.

In particular, we apportions multiple reads aligned with LINE-AP instances across genome categories. We found that LINE-A activity is associated with cell turnover, and tissues with low cell turnover rates are more likely to show more pervasive transcription.

Obesity is defined as having a body mass index of over 30 in adults or over the 95th centile in children. Both of these conditions are major public health concerns in Western countries. Genetic studies have shown that small missing pieces of chromosome (deletions, which remove many genes) and changes to the lettering of genes (which stop the gene from working, mutations) can cause intellectual disability or obesity. Here we identified 9 children with intellectual disability and obesity who have mutations in a gene called MYT1L. This gene is thought to give an important instruction for brain development. To find out what the effect of loss of MYT1L is on brain development we reduced the levels of MYT1L (using a special chemical) in an experimental zebrafish. This showed that loss of MYT1L in zebrafish causes a problem with the development of the hypothalamus, which may explain how MYT1L mutations cause obesity in humans. In the zebrafish there was also reduction of a brain hormone called oxytocin which is involved in thought processes, which may explain why MYT1L mutations cause intellectual disability. We have identified a new genetic condition caused by MYT1L mutations, further study of this gene will help us understand, and treat, intellectual disability and obesity.","Mental retardation (OMIM) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by intellectual disability and obesity.

We also identified transcriptomic consequences of MY T1L loss function in CRISPR-Cas9 knockout cells. Gene Ontology analysis of knockout cells demonstrated altered expression of genes that regulate gene expression in the nucleus. These differentially expressed genes were enriched in OMIM disease ontology terms “mental retardation”. Our study demonstrates that the developmental effects of MYt1L and loss function were created in zebrafish by knockdown of morpholinos. Knockdown of zebra fish manifested a loss of oxytocin expression in preoptic neuroendocrine area.

To increase the power of the tests for high dimensional association analysis of multiple phenotypes with next-generation sequencing data, a key issue is to develop novel statistics that can effectively extract informative internal representation and features from high dimensional data. However, the current paradigm of association analysis of multiple phenotypes does not efficiently utilize the rich correlation structure of the genotype and phenotype data. To shift the paradigm of association analysis from shallow multivariate analysis to comprehensive functional analysis, we proposed a new general statistical framework referred to as a quadratically regularized functional canonical correlation analysis (QRFCCA) for association test which explores rich correlation information in the genotype and phenotype data. Large-scale simulations demonstrate that the QRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the many existing statistics while retaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate the new approach, the QRFCCA are also applied to the TwinsUK study with 46 traits and sequencing data. The results show that the QRFCCA substantially outperforms the other statistics.","Pleiotropic effects of genetic variants increase statistical power, provide important information to achieve deep understanding of complex genetic structures and disease, and offer powerful tools for designing effective treatments with fewer effects.

In cyanobacteria, almost all the genes are rhythmically expressed with the same ∼24 h period yet exhibit a variety of phase relationships and waveforms. Remarkably, the core pacemaker ticks robustly via simple biochemical reactions carried out by three Kai proteins: KaiC undergoes circadian phosphorylation in the presence of KaiA, KaiB and ATP. In this work, we propose a reaction network modeling the Kai oscillator based on the differentiation of dual phosphorylation sites. We found a dynamic diversity in KaiC phosphorylation which may serve as a potential regulatory mechanism related to the diverse-phased genome-wide expressions in cyanobacteria. In addition, we deduce that each KaiC hexamer is a single oscillator in regulating its own phosphorylation and interactions with KaiA or/and KaiB. In complex organisms, a number of key clock components possess similar activities (e.g., phosphorylation) with multiple nonequivalent active sites, and they may also show some unusual dynamic features that are embedded in the proteins' own reaction networks. We hope our work could be helpful to study the correlations between gene expressions and circadian rhythm in prokaryotic cells, even in eukaryotic cells.","Circadian KaiC phosphorylation in cyanobacteria has recently been reconstituted in vitro and recently initiates a series of studies experimentally and theoretically to explore the mechanism. In this paper, we report the dynamic diversity of the hexameric KaiC subunit that phosphoforms a multi-layer reaction network based on nonequivalence of dual phosphorylating sites (S431 and T432) in the KaiA subunit. These diverse oscillatory profiles generate a kaleidoscopic phase modulation pattern probably responsible for genome-wide transcription rhythms directly and/or indirectly. Particularly, we show that a single KaiC hexamer energy-based, phosphorylated-dependent self-regulated circadian oscillator modulates KaiA and KaiB. We suggest that T432 is the main regulator of oscillation amplitude, while S431 is the major phase regulator. Robustness of the Kai network was examined by mixing samples from different phases, varying protein concentrations and temperature. Similar results were obtained regardless of the deterministic stochastic method employed. Thus, dynamic diversities and robustness of Kai oscillator qualified as a core pacemaker that controls cellular processes and cyanobacterial pervasively and accurately."

Genotype diversity, defined as the number of unique genotypes, and the interaction between genotypes, can strongly influence virulence and pathogen transmission. Understanding how genotypic diversity affects transmission of pathogens that naturally cycle among disparate hosts, such as vector-borne pathogens, is especially important as the capacity of the host and vector to sustain genotypic diversity may differ. To address this, we exposed Dermacentor andersoni ticks, via infected mice, to variably diverse populations of Francisella novicida genotypes. Interestingly, we found that ticks served as greater ecological filters for genotypic diversity compared to mice. This loss in genotypic diversity was due to both stochastic and selective forces. Based on these data and a model, we determined that high numbers of ticks in an environment support high genotypic diversity, while genotypic diversity will be lost rapidly in environments with low tick numbers. Together, these results provide evidence that vector population dynamics, vector-to-host ratios, and competition among pathogen genotypes play critical roles in the maintenance of pathogen genotypic diversity.","Pathogen genotypic diversity is an important determinant of pathogen phenotypes and transmissibility to virulence. In vector-borne pathogens, mammalian hosts act as ecological filters (the number of unique genotypes circulating in a circulating area) preventing infection by particular genotypes. Mammalian hosts act “ecological filters” to limit pathogen diversity, and novel variants are frequently eliminated by stochastic events such as fitness costs or fitness costs. Here, we show that a natural tick vector, Francisella novicida (Dermacentor andersoni), acts as a stronger ecological filter for pathogen genotype diversity compared to the mammalian host. In mice and ticks exposed to mixtures of F. novicIDA genotypes, significantly fewer genotypes were co-colonized in ticks compared to mice. Competition between genotypes contributed to the reduction in diversity of infection in the tick midgut, and genotypes recovered from ticks midguts mixed with genotype infections recovered from individual genotype infection. These results demonstrate that vector population dynamics, especially vector-to-host ratio, is strongly affected by pathogen and genotype population dynamics over time. Understanding the pathogen-genotypic population dynamics may aid identification of variables that strongly affect pathogen transmission and disease ecology."

Twin studies have demonstrated that inheritance plays a significant role in PCOS, and recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated 11 susceptibility regions. The mechanism by which these genetic loci cause PCOS has yet to be determined. We looked at DNA methylation and gene expression levels in these 11 loci in fat biopsies from women with and without PCOS. We identified differences in the expression of two receptors that bind hormones known to contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS–the receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin. We found increased expression of the LH receptor in non-obese PCOS women, while in the obese women with PCOS the insulin receptor was underexpressed. Both excess LH stimulation and elevated insulin levels, due to decreased receptor levels and resulting insulin resistance, can cause increased androgen production from the ovary. Our findings suggest the primary mechanism for elevated androgen levels in PCOS may differ between non-obese and obese women with PCOS and that the clinical heterogeneity seen in PCOS may have genetic underpinnings.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder in young women characterized by androgen excess and oligomenorrhea. The risk loci of PCOS are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the functional context. We measured DNA methylation and gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies to identify PCOS-specific alterations. We found that the LHCGR region, STON1-GTF2A1L, is overexpressed in non-obese PCOS women, whereas the INSR region is underexpressed among obese PCOS subjects. Alterations in gene expression of LHCG, RAB5B and INSR regions suggest that SNPs loci are functional and affect gene expression directly or indirectly through epigenetic alterations. These studies provide a genetic molecular basis for reported clinical heterogeneity in PCOS."

Nevertheless, observations suggested that patients experience pain during wound care dressings. This study explored views on pain, along with pain assessment and treatment practices. Medical records were reviewed on prescribed pain medication and health care professionals involved in BU treatment were invited for an interview to elicit their views on pain including current pain practices. Interviews were held in private locations, audio-taped, and analyzed qualitatively. In the majority of medical records, pain medication was prescribed. Mostly simple analgesics were prescribed, while health care professionals reported not being trained in the assessment of mild pain, and indications were often missing. Health care professionals indicated advanced BU might be painful, and that pain can increase after wound treatment, and after a skin graft at the donor site. They perceive the recognition of pain as difficult as patients suppress or exaggerate pain, and have different expectations regarding acceptable pain levels. Finally, they indicated a fear of side effects of pain medication, a shortage of, and irregularities in supply of pain medication, and limited time among medical doctors for pain management. These findings indicate pain during BU disease deserves attention and pain practices should be integrated in standard treatment.","Buruli ulcer (BU) is described as a relatively painless condition; however, clinical observations reveal patients do not experience pain treatment.

African trypanosomiasis is present in Sub-Saharan Africa and transmitted by infected tsetse flies. This devastating disease is lethal if untreated, making it important to understand and characterise the basic biology of the pathogen. During the T. brucei cell cycle, organelle positioning and segregation show a high degree of coordination and control. As such, T. brucei is a highly polarised cell with the transition zone of the flagellum present inside an invagination of the pellicular membrane called the flagellar pocket (FP). The FP is the main site of traffic into and out of the cell. At the exit point of the flagellum is a cytoskeletal structure called the flagellar pocket collar (FPC). One component of the FPC, BILBO1, has been characterised as essential for the FP biogenesis and cell survival. Here, we identify a new partner of BILBO1 called FPC4, and determine the domains involved in the BILBO1-FPC4 interaction. We further highlight the role of FPC4 in the segregation of the FPC and in the interplay between the FPC and other essential cytoskeletal structures.","Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a group of unicellular, flagellated parasites responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. The parasite is responsible for a large number of organelle remodelling, which occurs during the life cycle of the parasite and is accompanied by major changes in morphology and organelle positioning. The flagella originates from the basal bodies of the cell body and exits from cell body to the flagelar pocket (FP). The FP is attached to the cell surface flagesllum attachment zone (FAZ) and is the sole site of endo-exocytosis. The FAZ contains a large complex of cytoskeletal proteins, plus an intracellular set of specialised microtubules (MtQ) that elongate basal bodies in the anterior end of cell. The distal end of the FP, which is essential for the parasite pathogenicity, is surrounded by a small, extracellular, cytoskeleton collar (FPC) that circumvents the flangellum. Overlapping of the FPC hook complex (HC) (a sub-structured structure previously named bilobe) is essential thought to be involved in protein FP entry. In this study, we identify a new BILBO1 partner protein, FPC4, as a co-factor of FPC, HC, and MtQ. Our data suggest that FPC and HC have a tripartite association."

One kind of reproductive isolation, the sterility and inviability of species hybrids, is characterized by two of the strongest rules in evolutionary biology. The first is Haldane's rule: for species crosses in which just one hybrid sex is sterile or inviable, it tends to be the sex defined by having a pair of dissimilar sex chromosomes (e.g., the “XY” of males in humans). The second rule is the large X effect: the X chromosome has a disproportionately large effect on hybrid fitness. We dissected the genetic causes of these two rules of speciation by replacing many small chromosomal segments of the fruit fly Drosophila sechellia with those of a closely related species, D. mauritiana. Together, these segments cover 70% of the genome. We found that virtually all segments causing hybrid sterility or inviability act recessively and that hybrid male sterility is by far the most common type of hybrid incompatibility, confirming two leading theories about the causes of Haldane's rule. We also found that X-linked segments are more likely to cause hybrid male sterility than similarly sized autosomal segments. These results show that the large X effect is caused by a higher density of hybrid incompatibilities on the X chromosome.","Postzygotic reproductive isolation is characterized by striking empirical patterns. The Haldane rule — preferential inviability of sterility between species of hybrids and heterogametic (XY) sex—has been established. The second-called large X effect—the substitution of species on the X chromosome disproportionately has a large effect on hybrid fitness compared to a similar substitution of the autosome. While the first rule has been well-established, the second rule remains controversial. Here, we dissect the genetic causes of the X effect using genome-wide introgression analysis of Drosophila mauritiana chromosome segments from the D. sechellia genetic background. We find that recessive hybrid incompatibilities outnumber dominant ones and hybrid male steriles outnumber types of incompatibility, consistent with the dominance of faster-male theories and the Haldanes rule, respectively. We also find that X-linked and autosomal introgressions are similar in size, but that they cause hybrid sterility (60% and 18%) in autosomal and autosome genes. These results confirm the large X effects and identify the proximate cause: the higher density of X chromosome autosomes."

Thioredoxin has two ‘free’ cysteines in its active site, which are used to break disulfide bonds in oxidized substrate proteins. In the first step, an intermediate thioredoxin-protein complex is formed, which is broken in the second step, releasing the substrate protein in its reduced state. In other words, the disulfide is being transferred from the substrate protein to thioredoxin, or the electrons coming from thioredoxin are shuttled to the protein substrate. The exact reaction mechanism, i.e., the detailed succession of steps in which the reaction takes place, of how this mixed disulfide is broken is not known and has been debated over the last twenty years. With a multidisciplinary approach, combining computational and experimental work, we provide fresh insights into how conformational changes activate the catalytic cysteines with which this universal reduction mechanism is completed with the correct regioselectivity. This work illustrates the strengths of computational approaches in probing phenomena which are otherwise very difficult to investigate experimentally.","Thioredoxin (Trx) is a nucleophilic cysteine thiolate dissociation complex that has been debated for many years. In this study, we show that Trx is an endogenous substrate of the arsenate reductase (ArsC).

In addition, we observed conformational changes in the intermediate disulfide of Trx that bring Cys31Trx contact with Cys34Trx. In contrast, the Cys33Trx was found to be reactive to CYS82Arsc.

Recent studies indicate a role for MITF, a master regulator of melanocyte development and biogenesis, in melanoma progression. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor ATF2 negatively regulates MITF transcription in melanocytes and in about 50% of melanoma cell lines. Increased MITF expression, seen upon inhibition of ATF2, effectively attenuated the ability of BRAFV600E-expressing melanocytes to exhibit a transformed phenotype, an effect partially rescued when MITF expression was also blocked. Significantly, the development of melanoma in mice carrying genetic changes seen in human tumors was inhibited upon inactivation of ATF2 in melanocytes. Melanocytes from mice lacking active ATF2 expressed increased levels of MITF, confirming that ATF2 negatively regulates MITF and implicating this newly discovered regulatory link in melanoma development. Primary melanoma specimens that exhibit a high nuclear ATF2-to-MITF ratio were found to be associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis, further substantiating the significance of MITF control by ATF2. In all, these findings provide genetic evidence for the role of ATF2 in melanoma development and indicate an ATF2 function in fine-tuning MITF expression, which is central to understanding MITF control at the early phases of melanocyte transformation.","The transcription factor ATF2 has been shown to attenuate melanoma susceptibility to apoptosis and promote the ability to form tumors in xenograft models. To directly assess the role of ATF2 in melanoma development, we crossed a mouse melanoma model (NrasQ61K::Ink4a−/−) and mice expressing mutant ATF2 melanocytes. In contrast to 7/21 Nrasq61K and Ink4A−/+ mice, 1/21 mice expressing mutants of ATF 2 melanocytes developed melanoma.

Senescent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) residing in the joint may be a critical target for the prevention of osteoarthritis; however, the key regulators of MSC senescence are little known, and targeting aging regulatory genes for the treatment of osteoarthritis has not yet been reported. Here, we show that Yes-associated protein (YAP), a major effector of Hippo signaling, represses human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) senescence through transcriptional up-regulation of forkhead box D1 (FOXD1).

This interaction modulates several aspects of the viral cycle, including viral attachment, which in most cases depends on the host glycobiology dictated by the secretor and Lewis genotypes. The capacity to synthesize secretory type-I antigen H (fucose-α1,2-galactose-β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine; H1) at the mucosae, dictated by the presence of one or two functional copies of the fucosyl-transferase FUT2 gene (secretor status), has been clearly linked to infectivity in important enteric viruses such as the noroviruses. However, a big controversy existed about the contribution of H1 antigen to infection in the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in young children (rotavirus). It has not been until recently that epidemiological data evidenced a diminished incidence of rotavirus in non-secretor individuals unable to produce H1. In the present manuscript we offer the evidence that P[8] RV bind H1 via a binding site common for the P[II] RV genogroup and that the H1 precursor lacto-N-biose (galactose-β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine; LNB) is also bound to this pocket with diminished affinity. The P[8] VP8* structures show a marginal role for the L-fucose moiety from H1 in protein interaction. However, its presence provides conformational changes in the LNB moiety that increase the affinity of VP8* for the H1 ligand and would account for a stronger RV binding to mucosa in individuals expressing H1 (secretors). We thus offer a mechanistic explanation for the different incidence of P[8] RV infection in different secretor phenotypes.","Rotavirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in young children and young adults, with the P[8] genotype accounting for 80% of infections in humans. The molecular bases of the binding of the VP8* domain to the VP4 spike protein of the cellular receptor, the secretory H type-1 antigen (Fuc-α1,2-Gal-β1,3-GlcNAc; H1), and the precursor lacto-N-biose (LNB) have been determined. The resolution of the crystal structures of the complex H1 antigen LNB and site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that glycans bind to the P(8) VP8 * protein binding pocket shared with members of the two P[II] genogroup (i.e.: P[4] and P[6] P[19]. These results provide a molecular explanation for different susceptibility to rotavirus infection in secretor and non-secretor individuals."

We determine the characteristics of the pheromone plume which are best detected by the male reception system. We show that they are in agreement with plume measurements in the field, so providing quantitative evidence that this system also obeys the efficient coding principle.

The major source of infection is Lake Victoria; however, there is evidence of inland transmission especially within the informal settlements of Kisumu city. Schistosomiasis can be controlled using three key approaches which include improved sanitation, health education and mass treatment with praziquantel. Additional interventions for infection prevention include: promotion of hygiene, access to safe water, and sanitation improvement and environmental management. However, the success of control initiatives involving the community depend on the level of the communities' uptake of the program, which is hinged upon understanding the community knowledge and practices towards the disease. This study therefore collected information from the community to assess level of awareness of schistosomiasis. The findings revealed a low level of awareness in spite of a high prevalence of schistosomiasis. These findings are invaluable in the designing of appropriate education messages targeted at raising community awareness on schistosomiasis and relevant behavioural change required for a successful control programme.","Intestinal schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects more than 16 million people in 56 districts of Kenya.

We found that attitudes, health seeking behaviour, and environmental antecedents affect control. We also identified knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to strengthen schistoomiasis control interventions in informal and urban settings. This study was carried out in an informal urban settlement in Kisumu city. The study adopted a cross-sectional design and purposive sampling technique. The focus group discussions were conducted with adult community members and key informant interviews and opinion leaders.

However, moderate knowledge of risk factors were high risk groups in the study area. The attitudes of the community towards schistoscopy control were generally indifferent to the general belief that control of environmental circumstances will reduce transmission and reduce transmission. The findings suggest that the need for health education to raise community awareness about the presence, causes and transmission of schistotomiasis in urban settings in order augment prevention, control, and elimination efforts."

Here we reveal the interplay between the cellular protein mTOR, which functions in two distinct protein complexes, and influenza virus infection. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is activated during influenza virus infection through a cascade of specific modifications, or phosphorylation events, and by reducing the levels of another cellular protein termed REDD1, which is an mTORC1 inhibitor. Activation of mTORC1 results in additional phosphorylation events that together promote viral protein expression and replication. On the other hand, mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) phosphorylates AKT at a specific site during infection, which is a process mediated by the viral NS1 protein that is known to regulate viral-mediated cell death. Since these effects occur midway through the virus life cycle in the infected cell, mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation are likely important to regulate the cellular environment in order to facilitate the late stages of viral infection.","Influenza virus usurps host signaling factors to regulate replication and motility. The role of mTORC1 in viral infection has not been studied. In addition, the mechanisms that induce mTORc1 activation substrates are not well understood. In this study, we show that the protein PDPK1 differentially phosphorylates AKT during influenza virus infection. PdpK1-mediated phoshorylation of AKT at a distinct site is required for mTORA1 activation. In contrast, the viral NS1 protein promotes phosphorylation at a different site of m TORC2, which is known to regulate apoptosis. Influenza virus HA protein-regulatory mTOR1 inhibitor and the REDD1 virus M2 protein promote mTORI1 activity. Systematic phosphoproteomics analysis performed in cells lacking the mMTORC2 component Rictor in absence of Torin, an inhibitor of the mTORR1-dependent substrates regulated during infection revealed that mTORCs are regulated by several pathways. Members of the pathways that regulate mTORCI1 are also regulated by mTORCO1, including constituents of translation machinery that are activated to promote translation and replication. These results suggest that the early stages of influenza virus replication are optimal during the virus life cycle, and that the effects of viral protein expression likely support late stages of the virus replication in infected cells."

Such control systems can often operate in a surprisingly robust manner, in spite of constant perturbations from fluctuating internal conditions and a volatile external environment. What feature makes such control mechanisms robust? Is there a general way to achieve robustness? Here, we address these questions by investigating the wiring of interaction networks, which contains the most condensed information about the control mechanisms of biological systems. We suggest that one of the most important factors in the realization of biological robustness rests in the global coherency of the control strategy, i.e., the consistency of commands flowing through different routes in the network to the same destination. To implement this idea, we propose an order parameter termed ‘regulation entropy’ to quantitatively describe this control consistency of networks. We find that this order parameter correlates with the resistance of the system to external perturbations as well as internal fluctuations. Our results suggest that the self-consistency of the control strategy is important for the vitality and robustness of living organisms.","Biological regulatory networks are highly dynamic systems that regulate the behavior of biological systems. The topological characteristics of a biological control network largely determine their dynamic behavior, but the actual mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we define a novel structural feature of biological networks, termed ‘regulation entropy’, and quantitatively assess the influence of network topology on robustness in systems. We demonstrate that the quantity of dynamic stability in biological control networks is a significant association between the quantity and structural stability of these networks. We conclude that regulation entropy is an effective order parameter for evaluating the robustness of biological regulatory networks."

The main strategy to control schistosomiasis is to regularly treat school-aged children with the drug praziquantel. The frequency of praziquantel treatment depends on the average prevalence of schistosomiasis, which can be defined as low (prevalence <10%), moderate (10–50%), or high (>50%). However, it remains unclear at which geographical scale these prevalence levels should be considered to avoid unnecessary treatments but still comply with local needs. We investigated the effect of the geographical scale for an ensemble of 29 West and East African countries using previously published model-based schistosomiasis risk estimates obtained at high spatial resolution. These estimates allow spatial risk aggregation at different geographical scales (i.e., country, region, district, or pixel level). More than 70 million praziquantel treatments are required every year for school-aged children if countrylevel estimates are used. On a more refined geographical scale (i.e., province), annualized praziquantel treatments increase by 12%. Depending on the averaged schistosomiasis prevalence and the spatial risk variation across a country, the difference in the estimated amount of praziquantel between country-level aggregation and other geographical scales might be very important, as for example in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali.","Despite decades of neglect, schistosomiasis control is still going on at a large scale. The strategy of choice for preventive chemotherapy, repeated large-scale administration of praziquantel (a safe and highly efficacious drug) in high-risk populations is usually defined based on endemicity, usually defined by prevalence data summarized arbitrarily at an arbitrarily chosen administrative level. In this study, we determined the annualized treatment needs of the school-aged population, adhering to World Health Organization guidelines. Different administrative levels of prevalence aggregation were considered; country, province, district, pixel level, and country-level risk estimates. Previously published results from selected countries were employed to classify the area of distinct endemicity classes that govern the frequency and intensity of administration. We found that infection prevalence was adjusted for school-age population in 2010, and that countries classified as moderately endemic and highly endemic (≥50%) were highly endemic. The distribution of schistomiasis in Ethiopia, Liberia, Mauritania, Uganda, Zambia and Tanzania was uniform, but country-wide risk estimates were sufficient to calculate treatment needs."

It is caused by infection of the eyes with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. However, sometimes the clinical signs of disease can be present without infection being detected. Control efforts involve surgery, antibiotic treatment, face washing, and environmental improvement for better hygiene. Surveys of trachoma help countries to know whether and where they should implement control interventions. The Gambia is found in West Africa and has suffered from trachoma for decades. We conducted a survey of two Gambian regions to look at how much trachoma disease and C. trachomatis infection there is in the eyes. We found that although there was enough disease (≥10%) to warrant antibiotic treatment for everyone in the regions, there was nearly no infection (0.3%). This means that using clinical signs alone to make treatment decisions in low prevalence settings like The Gambia can lead to the waste of scarce resources. Our results also suggest that since less than 1% of children are infected with C. trachomatis, The Gambia is on course to achieve the World Health Organization's aim of eliminating blinding trachoma by the year 2020.","Trachoma has been endemic in the Gambia for decades. National trachoma control activities took place in the mid-1980s, and a mass antibiotic treatment campaign was carried out. However, the prevalence of active and actual ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection was measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The Gambian regions had the highest prevalence of the disease in a national survey conducted in 1996 prior to the planned national mass antibiotic and treatment distribution in 2006. A two stage random sampling survey was conducted in 61 randomly selected Enumeration Areas (EAs) in the North Bank Region (NBR) and Lower River Region (LRR) of Gambia. In LRR, swabs were taken to test for ocular C. trachomyatis infection. Unadjusted prevalences for active and active Trachoma were calculated, and the tracoma control programme was implemented in the LRR. This study shows a large discrepancy in the prevalence and clinical signs of ocular and ocular chlamydia infection in Gambian children aged 1–9 years. The prevalence of infection based on clinical signs may lead to unnecessary treatment, but the prevalence for active trachomas remains high. Assuming repeated infection is required for progression of blinding sequelae, blinding of trachyoma is the course of elimination in 2020."

Although the virus has been extensively studied with regard to epidemiology, virology, clinical features and other aspects, there are still no approved antiviral drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent infections of SARS-CoV. The spike (S) glycoprotein of the coronavirus, responsible for host cell attachment and mediating host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection, is key to the viral life cycle and a major target for antiviral drugs and vaccines. In this study, we report the structures of different conformational states of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein during virus entry. Specifically, we found that the S glycoprotein retains the prefusion trimer structure after trypsin cleavage and low-pH treatment. Additionally, binding with host cell receptor ACE2 promotes the release of S1 subunits from the S trimer and triggers the pre- to postfusion conformational transition. Our results provide new insights for understanding the mechanisms involved in coronavirus S glycoprotein-mediated virus entry.","The trimeric SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) surface spike (S) glycoprotein consisting of S1-S2 heterodimers binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the fusion of viral cellular membranes during the pre- and postfusion conformation transition.

We show that the receptor-binding domain of the trimeric S glycoproteins binds to ACE2 and adopts a protruding “” conformation. In addition, we studied the structures of SARS–CoV and S-coV surface spike complexes with ACE2 under different in vitro conditions, which mimic different conformational states of S-coprotein virus entry. Disassociation between S1 and ACE2 complex prefusion spikes was observed. We characterized rosette-like structures clustered in SARS and CoV S2 trimers in the post-fusion state observed in electron micrographs. Structural comparisons suggested that the S.

The repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, consists of a histone octamer around which DNA is wrapped into two superhelical turns. The nucleosome is a barrier for various nuclear processes which require access to DNA. To repair lesions on DNA, this barrier has to be overcome by either nucleosome remodeling or by histone eviction. Here we present evidence that FACT, a protein known to be involved in transcription, is also involved in BER, by boosting nucleosome remodeling. Upon in vivo oxidized DNA lesion induction, FACT exhibits a BER-like protein behavior, and it is recruited to the sites of DNA damages. In vitro experiments show that FACT boosts the remodeling activity of the chromatin remodeler RSC and is implicated in DNA repair. The presence of FACT greatly facilitates the removal of uracil from nucleosomal, but not from naked DNA, in a RSC-mediated reaction. Taken collectively, our in vitro and in vivo data reveal a role of FACT in BER by helping the remodeling of chromatin at the sites of lesions.","DNA double strand break repair (BER) is an important step in DNA repair. BER is the first step in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In this study, we present evidence that FACT is directly involved in Base Excision Repair and elucidate the chromatin remodeling mechanisms of FACT during BER. We found that oxidative stress induces FACT to release transcription related protein complexes that are associated with repair proteins of chromatin and remodelers of the SWI/SNF family. Interestingly, FACT facilitates the removal of uracil-DNA glycosylase from the nucleosomal DNA thanks to the enhancement of remodeling activity of RSC. Altogether, our data suggest that the FACT acts in concert with RSC to facilitate the excision of DNA lesions at the initial step of BER and that this is a novel property for FACT."

The origins of this colony are not clear and the extent to which it is genetically representative of the species is unknown. Using population genetics analyses to compare the current colony with two potential source populations we have shown that the colony is from the Kenya/Uganda border and that its foundation and establishment in the laboratory were associated with a genetic bottleneck, i.e. reduction of genetic variation due to increased genetic drift in a population of reduced size. As a consequence, the genetic diversity of the colony is lower than that of G. pallidipes field populations.","The African trypanosomiasis (IAEA) colony is available for mass rearing of Glossina pallidipes, a vector of human and animal African Trypanosoma, in eastern Africa. The IAEA colony is the source of Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) programs in East Africa. However, the source population of the colony is unclear and genetic diversity has not been previously evaluated compared to field populations. We examined the genetic variation of the population at the IEA colony in north Zimbabwe and the Kenya/Uganda border using 9 microsatellites loci to retrace the demographic history of the IA colony. We performed classical population genetics analyses combined historical genetic data and quantitative analysis with Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). ABC analyses revealed that the foundation establishment of colony was associated with a genetic bottleneck that resulted in loss of 35.7% of alleles and 54% of expected heterozygosity compared to source population. Furthermore, we found that tsetse control carried out in 1990 likely reduced the effective population size of the Kenya and Uganda border population. These analyses indicate that the area of origin of the AIAA colony in Kenya and the Uganda border is the genetic bottleneck associated with the foundation of colony. Genetic diversity associated with traits important for SIT could be potentially lost if the colony was lost from the field and lead to suboptimal competitiveness in the colony males in the field."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continuously monitor the amount of influenza that is present in the American population and compiles this information in weekly reports. However, because it can take a long time to collect and analyze all of this information, the data that is being reported each week is typically between 1–2 weeks old at the time of publishing. For this reason, we are interested in developing new techniques to determine the amount of influenza in the population that are accurate, can return results in real-time, and can be used to supplement traditional monitoring. We have created a method of estimating the amount of influenza-like illness in the American population, at any time of year, by analyzing the amount of Internet traffic seen on certain influenza-related Wikipedia articles. This method is able to accurately estimate the percentage of Americans with influenza-like illness, in real-time, and is robust to influenza seasons that are more severe than normal and to events that promote much media attention, such as the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.","Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a major public health problem in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Here, we introduce a novel method for estimating, near-real time, the level and intensity of influenza-related Wikipedia articles on a daily basis. We calculated the number of times certain influenza-health-related articles were accessed on a day in December 2007 and August 2013 compared to data from the official ILI and activity levels provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In previous work, we and others have shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is important in protecting from severe fungal infections. We now show that, in addition to the NLRP3 inflammasome, a different inflammasome containing NLRC4 is also important in protecting against infection with Candida albicans, and appears to be functioning in the mucosal lining of the mouth and intestines, rather than in immune cells. Our research explains a new mechanism of mucosal immunity to fungal infections and has broad implications for developing new treatments against fungal infections, which are a serious cause of illness and death, particularly in immunocompromised persons. Additionally, this research may also lead to new ways to identify those individuals who are at the highest risk for serious fungal infections.","Candida sp. is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that colonizes the skin of the oral cavity, causing inflammation and disease.

Furthermore, we reveal the tissue specific roles of NLR4 in anti-fungal defenses against mucosal infection, which impacts inflammatory cell recruitment and infected tissues, and protects systemic dissemination of infection. Deficiency of NLRC2 and NLRP 3 results in severely attenuated pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial peptide responses in the mucosal cavity. In bone marrow and chimeric mouse models, in contrast to NLRP1, NLRP2 limits the severity of infection present in the hematopoietic and stromal compartments.

In order to gain insight into some factors behind this crisis, we have analyzed statistical information extracted from thousands of cognitive neuroscience and psychology research papers. We established that the statistical power to discover existing relationships has not improved during the past half century. A consequence of low statistical power is that research studies are likely to report many false positive findings. Using our large dataset, we estimated the probability that a statistically significant finding is false (called false report probability). With some reasonable assumptions about how often researchers come up with correct hypotheses, we conclude that more than 50% of published findings deemed to be statistically significant are likely to be false. We also observed that cognitive neuroscience studies had higher false report probability than psychology studies, due to smaller sample sizes in cognitive neuroscience. In addition, the higher the impact factors of the journals in which the studies were published, the lower was the statistical power. In light of our findings, the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic, and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.","The distribution of published effect sizes is estimated by analyzing 26,841 statistical records from 3,801 cognitive neuroscience psychology papers published recently.

In the chordate phylum, only colonial ascidians (invertebrate chordates also known as sea squirts) have the documented ability to wholly regenerate. Once separated from the colony, any minute fragment of peripheral blood vessel (about 1 mm in length, containing 100–300 blood cells) of the colonial ascidian Botrylloides leachi regenerates an entire functional adult within one to three weeks. By following cellular and molecular events in Botrylloides WBR, we revealed that this system proceeds differently from regeneration events in other model organisms by several fundamental criteria. This is, for example, to our knowledge the first documented case of WBR initiating from circulating blood cells that restore not only the body tissue, but also the germ line. We found that retinoic acid (RA) signaling, previously reported in the regeneration of specific vertebrate tissues and organs, plays a major role in WBR via RA receptor expression throughout the entire regenerating animal. This suggests that RA signaling may have had ancestral roles in body restoration events. Elucidating the processes involved in this WBR system will improve our understanding of the nature of regeneration and the reduced regeneration capabilities represented in so many vertebrates.","Regeneration of adult chordates is confined to model cases and terminates in restoration of restricted tissues. In this study, we show that a unique phenomenon of body regeneration (WBR) in the colonial urochordate Botrylloides leachi is induced in a miniscule blood vessel fragment. In contrast to documented cases, regeneration is induced systemically in blood vessels. Multiple buds appear simultaneously in newly established regeneration niches in vasculature fragments, stemming from composites of pluripotent blood cells terminating in the functional zooid. We found that retinoic acid (RA) regulates diverse developmental aspects of WBR, including epimorphosis formation and blastema induction. We also found that the RA receptor retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-related gene is expressed specifically in blood cells and is expressed in the regeneration niche of bud development. In addition, RA inhibitors and RNA interference knockdown experiments resulted in WBR arrest and bud malformations. Our findings suggest that RA signaling may have ancestral roles in body restoration events."

A hallmark of infection with Schistosoma mansoni is the immune response to parasite eggs trapped in the liver and other organs. This response involves an infiltration of cells that surround the parasite egg forming a “granuloma.” In mice deprived of T-cells, this granulomatous response is lacking, and toxic products released by eggs quickly cause liver damage and death. Thus the granulomata protect the host from toxic egg products. Only one hepatotoxic molecule, omega-1, has been described to date. We set out to identify other S. mansoni egg hepatotoxins using liver cells grown in culture. We first showed that live eggs, their secretions, and pure omega-1 are toxic. Using a physical separation technique to prepare fractions from whole egg secretions, we identified the presence of IPSE/alpha-1, a protein that is known to strongly influence the immune system. We showed that IPSE/alpha-1 is also hepatotoxic, and that toxicity of both omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 can be prevented by first mixing the proteins with specific neutralizing antibodies. Both proteins constitute the majority of hepatotoxicity released by eggs.","Schistosoma mansoni is a blood fluke parasite that infects the liver of humans and causes severe liver damage.

We also demonstrate that the plasma-derived protein, soluble-egg antigen (SEA), is a dose-dependent hepatotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of the omega-1 monoclonal antibody abolished toxicity and the pure and diluted toxicity of ESP and SEA 47 and 33%, respectively. Anion exchange chromatography of ESP yielded the predominant hepatotoxic fraction. Proteomics of ESP revealed the presence in IPSE and alpha-1 (IL-4 inducing principle of S. spp. and IL-4, a known activator of basophils inducer Th2 type responses. Our results indicate that IPSE /alpha-2 and IPSE-1 are the major contributors to the majority of the liver damage secreted from S. menoni eggs in vitro, and suggest that the parasite may also be a major contributor to liver damage in mice."

In this work we concentrated on the effect of 3′ end sequences. For this, we constructed a library of yeast strains that differ only by a native 3′ end region integrated downstream to a reported gene driven by a constant inducible promoter. Thus we could attribute all differences in reporter expression between the strains to the different 3′ end sequences. Interestingly, we found that despite being driven by the same strong, inducible promoter, our library spanned a wide and continuous range of expression levels of more than twelve-fold. As these measurements represent the sole effect of the 3′ end region, we quantify the contribution of these sequences to the variance in mRNA levels by comparing our measurements to endogenous mRNA levels. We follow by sequence analysis to find a simple sequence signature that correlates with expression. In addition, single cell analysis reveals distinct noise dynamics of 3′ end mediated differences in expression compared to different levels of promoter activation leading to a more complete understanding of gene expression which also incorporates the effect of these regions.","The 3′ end is a region of the genome that regulates gene expression. The 3′ ends are located downstream of the main promoter and affect gene expression, but the scale of effect encoded by DNA is limited. To measure the effect of native genes on expression, we constructed a library of 85 fluorescent reporter strains that differ in expression. Notably, despite being driven by a strong promoter, the library spans a continuous-fold range of expression values. These measurements correlate with endogenous mRNA levels, suggesting that the 3′ region contributes to constitutive differences in mRNA levels. Furthermore, we used a deep sequencing map of 3′UTR ends to determine the polyadenylation sites intrinsic to the local 3′-end sequence. We found that increased/T content upstream of a main polyadenylealation site correlates with higher expression, and the library is genome-wide, suggesting native genes differ in their encoded efficiency of processing. Finally, using single cells and fluorescence measurements, we show that different promoter activation levels, and different expression dynamics, modulate protein expression dynamics differently from promoters, predominantly affecting the size of protein production bursts as opposed to frequency bursts. Altogether, our results lead to a complete understanding of gene regulation by demonstrating that the three′ end regions are unique in their sequence dependent effect on gene expression and that their function is dependent on their expression."

Functionally important protein regions are typically more conserved than other regions because mutations in these regions are more likely to be deleterious. A number of phylogenetic models have been developed to identify conserved sites or regions in proteins by comparing protein sequences from multiple species. However, most of these methods treat amino acid sites independently and do not consider the spatial clustering of conserved sites in the protein tertiary structure. Therefore, their power of identifying functional protein regions is limited. We develop a new statistical model, GP4Rate, which combines the information from the protein sequences and the protein tertiary structure to infer conserved regions. We demonstrate that GP4Rate outperforms Rate4Site, the most widely used phylogenetic software for inferring functional amino acid sites, via simulations with a case study of B7-1 genes. GP4Rate is a potentially useful tool for guiding mutagenesis experiments or providing insights on the relationship between protein structures and functions.","The identification of functionally important amino acid sites in proteins is a critical question in biology. While functionally important sites are stronger purifying selection, site-specific substitution rates tend to tend to be lower than usual sites. A large number of phylogenetic models have been developed to estimate site-level substitution rates in proteins. However, most of these models assume that site-type substitution rates are independent of the protein’s structure. In this study, we developed a new model, GP4Rate, that incorporates a Gaussian process model and a standard phylogenetic model to identify slowly evolved regions of protein in protein tertiary structures. We show that this new model can be used to estimate the spatial correlation between sites and their evidence of function. Our results suggest that GP4R can potentially be used as a tool to predict functionally important regions of proteins in known structures."

PEL is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that usually develops in a hypoxic environment. There is no standard treatment for PEL and it carries a poor prognosis. Previous studies have revealed that certain KSHV-encoded genes are activated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), an intracellular factor that mediates much of the cellular response to hypoxia. KSHV in turn can upregulate HIF-1, suggesting HIF-1 might play a substantial role in PEL oncogenesis. Here, we report for the first time the effects of suppressing HIF-1α, an oxygen-sensitive subunit of HIF-1, in PEL tumor cells. We demonstrate that suppressing HIF-1α can dramatically affect the oncogenic metabolic signature of PELs, replication of KSHV, expression of KSHV-encoded oncogenes, and the growth of PEL cells. Findings presented here not only provide new insights into the role of HIF-1α in KSHV-induced tumors but also provide a rationale for using anti-HIF-1α agents as a therapeutic strategy for PEL and potentially other KSHV-associated malignancies.","Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma with poor prognosis caused by Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

The soil bacterium B. subtilis becomes “competent” for the uptake of environmental DNA, thus acquiring new genetic information. About 15% of the cells are chosen for expression of the competence genes by stochastic fluctuations in the transcription of comK. When the concentration of ComK exceeds a critical threshold, it activates its own expression, a molecular switch is thrown, and competence ensues in that cell. Here we ask why all of the cells do not eventually throw the switch. We show that the basal level expression of comK increases and then decreases as nutrients are exhausted, so that the number of cells exceeding the ComK threshold rises and falls, opening and closing a window of opportunity for competence. Two factors responsible for this “uptick” in comK expression are: 1) a global increase in transcription as cell division slows, and 2) a continual rise in the concentration of the master regulatory protein Spo0A-P, which activates and then represses comK as it accumulates. The global increase transmits growth rate information and the increase in Spo0A∼P encodes multiple signals, including the nutritional, replication, and population density status of the culture.","ComK transcriptionally controls competence uptake by transforming DNA into DNA in Bacillus subtilis. In a clonal population randomly selected for competence, ComK activates the promoter, and cells exceeding the threshold of ComK trigger a positive feedback loop, transitioning into a competence state. The transition rate increases as the maximum approach to the stationary phase decreases, but cells remaining remain. The average basal rate of comK transcription increases transiently, defining a window of opportunity for transitions accounting for heterogeneity in the competent populations. The concentration response regulator Spo0A∼P increases the entry into stationary phase, which induces comK promoter activity and represses direct binding. The activation of the antagonizing repressor, Rok, amplifies the inherent increase in the basal level of the ComK promoter, which takes place at the approach to stationary phase. This is a general feature of core promoters, serving as a couple of the probability of competence transitions and the growth rate. Competence transitions are regulated by a set of temporally controlled complex mechanisms that govern the formation of the spindle and the fate-determining noise of competence intrinsic to the comK promoters. The overall mechanism is stochastically simulated and has been shown to be plausible. However, the deterministic mechanism modulates the inherently stochastic process."

This gap in knowledge prevents an assessment of the potential for these parasites to infect humans and production animals and is largely due to the difficulty of conducting standard diagnostic tests on wildlife. To address this gap, we adapted a standard diagnostic assay to be used with dried urine samples. We used urine from geladas, primates endemic to Ethiopia, which are frequently infected with the larval stage of a taeniid tapeworm and exhibit protuberant cysts during advanced infection. The use of this diagnostic test in a wild gelada population allowed us to detect that individuals can be infected without exhibiting observable cysts, and that some individuals may control infection in its early stages. This tool provides information about how a neglected tapeworm functions in a wildlife system and opens the door to the non-invasive identification of tapeworm reservoir hosts that may threaten humans.","Taenia tapeworms are a mosquito-borne parasite that infects rodents and lagomorphs. The larval stage of Taenia serialis commonly parasitizes rodents, primates and primates endemic to Ethiopia. Geladas exhibit protuberant larval cysts indicative of advanced T. serialis infection and are associated with high mortality. However, non-protuberant larvae develop in the deep tissue of the abdominal cavity, leading to underestimates of the prevalence based solely on the presence of cysts. We adapted a non-invasive monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect circulating TaenIA spp. antigen in dried gelada urine. We found that ELISA was highly accurate in detecting TaENia antigen, with 98.4% specificity, 98.5% sensitivity, area curve 0.99. We also found that the prevalence of infection was substantially widespread in the wild gelada population, with a substantially widespread occurrence of visible T.serialis cysts (16.4%, 6% of the population exhibited cysts) and a significant sex bias in the cyst presence. Contrary to the female-biased bias observed in Taenias-host systems, we found no sex bias between cyst and antigen presence (older individuals were more likely to have cysts), and no age bias in antigen presence. We interpret this finding to indicate that T. seris infects individuals early in life and may result in visible disease later in life."

Parasite genetic diversity is related to geographical distribution and transmission cycles and might play a role in clinical manifestations as well as in anti-parasitic chemotherapy response. T. cruzi has been classified into six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs), after consensus reached among experts in the field. In order to effectively use this standardized nomenclature, a reproducible genotyping strategy is needed. Available typing schemes are usually applied to cultured parasite stocks, because they are not sensitive enough to be used in biological specimens. Only nested PCR procedures could directly type biological samples, but are prompt to contamination and require a high number of reactions. Thus, we developed a multiplex Real-Time PCR using TaqMan probes (MTq-PCR) for DTU typing in a single or a second round of amplification. It proved useful to determine DTUs in cultured stocks, vector and reservoir specimens, as well as in patients´samples, especially in those from individuals with acute, congenital infection or Chagas reactivation.

The use of the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia has become a potential biocontrol approach against dengue virus for two reasons. First, Wolbachia spreads rapidly through populations by manipulating host reproduction to its advantage. Second, Wolbachia limits viral replication in the mosquito by competing with the virus for essential host resources. Following field release in Cairns, Australia in 2011, the wMel strain of Wolbachia has successfully invaded wild mosquito populations, infecting nearly all individuals. To test whether limited dengue replication in wMel mosquitoes translates to a reduction in dengue transmission potential, we used a non-destructive assay to repeatedly quantify dengue virus in mosquito saliva. We found that wMel significantly delayed the time it took for mosquito saliva to become infectious, reduced the frequency of dengue virus that was expectorated by mosquitoes and lowered the virus titer in mosquito saliva. We also showed that wMel infection suppresses saliva production in mosquitoes that may, in part, explain our findings. The saliva-based nature of the work provides a more accurate assessment of Wolbachia’s ability to limit disease transmission and suggests that Wolbachia may have positive impacts on transmission not only by reducing the number of infectious mosquitoes in a population but also delaying the arrival of virus in the saliva.","Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most prevalent arthropod-borne diseases in the world. Approximately 40% of the world population is at risk of infection annually. Wolbachia pipientis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, has developed a biocontrol strategy to limit the replication of the virus in the mosquito. The virus is introduced into the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, and has been shown to invade the mosquito and spread near fixation field releases. Here, we use a non-destructive assay to quantify the length of the EIP, the time taken for the virus to arrive in saliva following consumption of DENV viremic blood. The EIP is key determinant of mosquito ability to transmit DENVs, and earlier virus appears to be saliva opportunities for the mosquito to infect humans and subsequent bites. We show that the length and duration of EIP can be determined by the concentration of the DENV in the saliva of mosquitoes. This lengthening EIP highlights means that, in addition to the reduction in infection frequencies and DENV titers in mosquitoes, Wolbachias operate to reduce DENV transmission in the field."

In particular, establishing proper connectivity at the midline is critical for the orchestration of rhythmic behaviors. Conserved genetic programs that instruct axon guidance at the midline have been characterized in multiple model systems, but the signaling mechanisms underlying axon guidance are not well understood. Slits and Robos comprise conserved families of axon guidance cues and receptors that control midline guidance by preventing inappropriate midline crossing. Here, we identify a novel mechanism that is required for Robo receptor activation and Robo-dependent axon repulsion in vivo. Using a combination of molecular genetic and cell biological approaches, we define a role for Slit-dependent trafficking of Robo from the plasma membrane to the early and late endosomes that contributes to Robo activation and signaling. In previous work, endocytic trafficking has been shown to modulate axon guidance responses by regulating surface levels of guidance receptors. In contrast, our observations indicate that endocytosis of the Robo receptor itself is required for receptor activation and precedes the recruitment of a key downstream signaling effector to the Robo receptor cytoplasmic domain.","The axon guidance receptor is activated by extracellular ligands that regulate growth cone motility and critical for proper wiring established during development. The Roundabout (Robo) guidance receptor mediates repulsion of the ligand Slit in invertebrates and vertebrates. Endocytic trafficking of the Robo receptor is essential for Slit-binding and repulsive signaling output. Dose-dependent genetic interactions in vitro and in vitro Robo activation assays support the role of Clathrin-dependent endocytosis, entry into early late endosomes and positive regulators of Slit and Robo signaling. We identify conserved motifs in Robo cytoplasmic domain that are required for the activation of Robo in vitro; gain function in genetic rescue experiments and provide strong evidence for trafficking events required for Robo repulsive guidance activity in vivo.

The proper function of the primary cilium relies on a cell's ability to target and concentrate specific receptors to the ciliary membrane – a unique subdomain of the plasma membrane yet little is known about how receptors are trafficked to the primary cilium. Mutations affecting the ciliary localized receptor fibrocystin (PKHD1) cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, which affects approximately 1∶20,000 individuals. Previously we identified a motif located in the cytoplasmic domain of fibrocystin that is required for its ciliary localization. In this work we demonstrate that the ciliary targeting sequence (CTS) of fibrocystin interacts with the small G protein Arf4 and this interaction is important for the efficient delivery of the CTS to cilia in cultured cells. Disruption of Arf4 in mice results in defects in the non-ciliated visceral endoderm and death at mid-gestation indicating Arf4 has vital functions in addition to ciliary protein trafficking.","The primary cilium is the sensory organelle, which is responsible for a wide range of human diseases including retinal degeneration, polycystic kidney disease, and birth defects. The sensory functions of cilia require specific receptors to be targeted to the ciliary subdomain of the plasma membrane. Arf4 is a protein that is essential for ciliary protein trafficking. In this work, we show that Arf 4 binds to fibrocystin, a key regulator of ciliary proteins trafficking. We also observe that the delay in delivery of newly synthesized CTS Golgi complex to cilia is reduced. We show that the delayed delivery of CTS to cilia is due to defects in the cilia cell structure and apical protein localization. Our work suggests that the disruption in ciliary assembly, important for the efficient transport of fibrotic cilia, plays critical roles in non-ciliary processes."

Gene shuffling can create genetic diversity that facilitates adaptation to new environments, but theory shows that this effect is highly dependent on how different genes interact in determining the fitness of an organism. Using a large data set of fitness values based on HIV-1, we provide evidence that shuffling of genetic material indeed raises the level of genetic diversity, and as a result accelerates adaptation. Our results also propose genetic shuffling as a mechanism utilized by HIV to accelerate the evolution of multi-drug-resistant strains.","Recombination can facilitate adaptation. In spite of substantial body theory of the impact of recombination on the evolutionary dynamics of adapting populations, empirical evidence to test theories are scarce. In this study, we examined the effect on recombination adaptation on the large-scale empirical fitness landscape of HIV-1 based on in vitro fitness measurements. We found that recombination substantially increases the rate of adaptation across a wide range of parameter values, including population size, mutation rate and recombination rate. We also found that the accelerating effect of recombinating on stronger intermediate mutation rates increases the monotonic way in which recombination rates increase in population sizes. We estimated that the fitness effects of individual mutations on epistatic fitness interactions cause recombination to accelerate adaptation and that the estimated epistasis for adapting populations is significantly negative. These results highlight the importance of recombin evolution in HIV-I."

X-chromosome inactivation is a chromosome-wide epigenetic gene silencing mechanism regulated by long non-coding Xist RNA. Mouse Xist RNA is commonly organized into 7 exons, with the extensively studied and known important domains of Xist residing within exon 1. However, the function of exon 7 of Xist RNA, which is the second longest exon, remains poorly understood. Our objective was to clarify the role of this exon in X-inactivation through the use of Xist truncation mutant female ES cells. Here, we provide evidence that Xist exon 7 is required for the stable localization of Xist RNA and X-linked gene silencing on the inactive X-chromosome.","In mammals, X-linked gene dosage varies between sexes. In mammalian females, Xist RNA inactivates the X-chromosome (Xi). In this study, we report the crucial function of Xist exon 7 in X-inactivation. Xist is the second-largest exon- conserved repeat in E eutherian mammals, and its role has been overlooked for X- inactivation. In female ES cells, we found significant differences in Xist expression levels and RNA stability in control cells expressing wild-type Xist, which compromised the localization of the Xist mRNA and incomplete silencing of X- linked genes on the inactive X- chromosome (Xi) in mutant cells. Furthermore, we show that interaction with mutant Xist and hnRNP U is required for the localization and localization of XIST RNA in Xi. Our results suggest that exon7 Xist plays an important role in stable Xist gene localization and silencing by silencing X-related genes on Xi."

To elucidate the disease-specific pathophysiology, we examined a mouse model harboring the mutation D801Y, which was originally found in a patient with Rapid onset Dystonia Parkinsonism, but recently, also in a patient with Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood. We found that this model exhibited motor deficits and developed dystonia when exposed to a drop in body temperature. Cerebellar in vivo recordings in awake mice revealed irregular firing of Purkinje cells and their synaptic targets, the deep cerebellar nuclei neurons, which was further exacerbated and evolved into abnormal high-frequency burst firing during dystonia. The development of specific neurological features within the ATP1A3 mutation spectrum, such as dystonia, are thought to reflect the functional consequences of each mutation, thus to investigate the consequence of the D801Y mutations we characterized mutated D-to-Y Na+/K+-ATPases expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These in vitro studies showed that the D-to-Y mutation abolishes pump-mediated Na+/K+ exchange, but still allows the pumps to bind Na+ and become phosphorylated, trapping them in conformations that instead support proton influx.","Dysstonia and Parkinsonism are two closely related movement disorders that are closely related to Parkinsonism and Alternating Hemiplegia. In this study, we identified a heterozygous hot spot disease mutation in the α3 isoform of Na+/K+-ATPase, D801Y (α3+/D801Y), which causes abrupt hypothermia-induced dystonia in mice. Single-neuron and in vivo recordings of awake mice revealed irregular firing of Purkinje cells in synaptic targets, deep cerebellar nuclei and neurons, and exacerbated dystonias evolved into abnormal high-frequency burst-like firing. Biophysically, the D--Y mutation abolished pump-mediated Na+ andK+ exchange, which allowed pumps to bind to Na+ phosphorylated. Our findings implicate aberrant cerebellary activity of α3 and other severe mutations in α3- isoform-related disorders, and add a functional understanding of scarce severe mutations of α4 isoform Na+ or K+-ATAPase."

Bacteria in the environment and in host organisms likely use networks of competitive mechanisms to survive and to shape the composition and function of diverse communities. In this study, we cultured two species of soil bacteria to observe the outcome of competition and to identify competitive functions that dictate the outcome. We show that one organism, Streptomyces sp. Mg1, produces antibiotic linearmycins that cause cellular lysis and degradation of a competing colony of Bacillus subtilis. In turn, the B. subtilis activate a resistance mechanism, either transiently or through mutation of a two-component signaling system. Activation of the signaling system produces a suite of identified responses, which include resistance to linearmycins, altered colony morphology that resembles biofilms, and enhanced motility of B. subtilis. This work identifies a unified, multifaceted survival response that is induced by a subpopulation of bacteria to escape lethal consequences of antibiotic-mediated competition.","Bacteria have diverse mechanisms of competition, including biosynthesis of extracellular enzymes and antibiotic metabolites, changes in community physiology, biofilm formation and motility. Considered collectively, networks of competitive functions in an organism determine success or failure of competition. In this study, we studied the competitive interaction between two soil bacteria: Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces sp. Mg1 (S.Mg1). We found that when S.mg1 is cultured at the agar surface, colonies of B. subtilises suffer cellular lysis and progressive degradation caused by S. MG1 cultured at a distance. We also found that the lytic degradative activity (LDA) of linearmycins, produced in the absence of LDA, is sufficient to cause lysis in B.tilis. We identified a missense mutation in yfiJK, which encodes a previously uncharacterized-component signaling system. We confirmed that the gain-of-function alleles of yfJK and yfiLMN are necessary for LDA resistance. Downstream yfiLN genes encode an ATP-binding cassette transporter, which is necessary for lysis. These developmental phenotypes suggest that these competitive functions are distinct, but regulated by a single-component system. Our findings suggest that a subpopulation of bacteria in the soil can activate an array of defensive responses to counter lytic stress imposed by competition. Coordinated regulation of development of antibiotic resistance is a streamlined mechanism to promote competitive fitness in bacteria."

Recent studies using microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies have demonstrated that beside annotated genes, a large proportion of the human genome can be transcriptionally active. Little is known, however, about the extent and the conservation of human brain transcripts located outside of the known genes' boundaries. Here, we use high-throughput transcriptome sequencing to characterize the non-ribosomal transcriptome of the human cerebellum and compare it to the transcriptomes of chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. Our results show that close to 40% of all transcripts expressed in the human brain map within repetitive elements. By contrast, less then 10% of the human brain transcriptome corresponds to non-repetitive intergenic regions. Nonetheless, within these regions we identify more than a thousand novel highly transcribed evolutionary conserved locations. Some of the intergenic transcripts show distinct human-specific expression and may have contributed to evolution of human-specific phenotypic traits.","The expression of annotated genes in the human brain has been characterized extensively, but the scope of conservation of transcripts located outside known genes' boundaries is limited.

This large proportion of transcripts (20%) represents 3′UTR extensions of known genes that play roles in alternative microRNA-directed regulation. Finally, transcriptome divergence between species increases over evolutionary time, and the intergenic transcripts expression differences between species and exons are uncharacterized.

These organelles have various important functions both in motility and sensing the environment. Motile cilia are essential for moving cells as well as moving fluids across a surface. The waveform of motile cilia requires large macromolecular motors; these are the ciliary dyneins. These dynein complexes are assembled in the cytoplasm in a pathway called preassembly, and then transported into cilia. Defects in this process cause a heterogeneous human disease called primary ciliary dyskinesia that results, for example, in the disruption of the motility of respiratory tract cilia, sperm and nodal cilia during development. The mechanisms of the preassembly pathway are not fully understood. In this study, we use a mutation in the well-conserved DYX1C1/PF23 gene of the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Loss of a conserved domain (DYX) reveals a failure to assemble most ciliary dyneins. Preassembly of inner arm dyneins is particularly affected. We find that if dynein arms are not assembled, dynein subunits in the cytoplasm are unstable. We suggest that DYX1C1 may play a role as a scaffold for other preassembly factors and the dynein subunits.","Cytoplasmic assembly of ciliary dyneins, a process known as preassembly, requires numerous non-dynein proteins, whose identities and functions are not fully elucidated.

We show that this protein is essential for the assembly of the majority of the ciliary inner dynein arms (IDA) and a fraction of the outer dyneine arms (ODA). We also show that DyX1c1 is required for the proper assembly of a subset of these ciliary IDAs. The C-terminal truncation of this protein results in a reduction of the subset of the IDAs that are preassembled. Sucrose gradients of cytopleasmic extracts from preassembled ciliary ciliary dyes are reduced compared to wild-type, suggesting an important role for DYx1C2 in dyneic complex stability."

Myelin production is extremely costly from the energetic point of view, and oligodendrocytes that are synthesizing myelin are particularly susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the function of mitochondria in mature oligodendrocytes, after myelination is completed, has been poorly explored using genetic models. Here, we have generated and characterized mouse models expressing different levels of the m-AAA protease, a proteolytic complex preserving proteostasis of the inner mitochondrial membrane and respiratory activity. We show that oligodendrocytes are capable to cope with reduced levels of the complex, but undergo rapid death upon complete ablation of the m-AAA protease. Thus, the m-AAA protease is essential for cell survival, but oligodendrocytes are less vulnerable than neurons to a deficiency of the complex.","M-AAA protease is a conserved protease that protects the inner mitochondrial membrane from degradation by mitochondria. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of m- AAA protease have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases in humans, hereditary spastic paraplegia and spinocerebellar ataxia. However, the essential functions of the m-Apa protease in neuronal survival remain enigmatic. Here, we show that deletion of a highly expressed subunit of the mitochondrial protein AFG3L2 in mature mouse oligodendrocytes provokes early-mammalian fragmentation and swelling, which is previously shown in neurons, and causes late-onset motor defects and myelin abnormalities. In contrast, total ablation of the protein m-AA protease, deleting the Afg3l2 paralogue of AfG3l1, triggers progressive motor dysfunction and demyelination, owing to rapid neuronal death. Surprisingly, mice with premature hair greying, caused by progressive loss of melanoblasts, share a common developmental origin with Schwann cells targeted in these experiments.

Here, we report that the lytic activity of LysGH15 and its CHAP domain is dependent on calcium ions. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we determined the structures of three individual LysGH15 domains using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The crystal structure unexpectedly reveals an “EF-hand-like” calcium-binding site near the Cys-His-Glu-Asn quartet active site groove in the LysGH15 CHAP domain. Furthermore, the calcium ion plays an important role as a switch that modulates the lytic activity of the CHAP domain. Additionally, structure-guided mutagenesis also confirms that both E282 and the zinc ion play an important role in maintaining the lytic activity of the LysGH15 amidase-2 domain. Moreover, the NMR structure and titration-guided mutagenesis identify residues in the LysGH15 SH3b domain that are involved in the interactions with the substrate.

We provide evidence that a surface protein present in several staphylococcal species forms functional amyloid aggregates to build the biofilm matrix in response to specific environmental conditions. Under low Ca2+ concentrations and acidic pH, Bap is processed and forms insoluble aggregates with amyloidogenic properties. When the Ca2+ concentration increases, metal-coordinated Bap adopts a structurally more stable conformation and as a consequence, the N-terminal region is unable to assemble into amyloid aggregates. The control of Bap cleavage and assembly helps to regulate biofilm matrix development as a function of environmental changes.","Biofilms are communities of bacteria that grow encased in an extracellular matrix that contains proteins.

Specifically, Bap processed fragments containing N-terminus protein aggregation-prone self-assembly-prone structures at acidic pHs and low concentrations of calcium. The molten globule-like state of Bap fragments was stabilized by binding to cation, hindering self-Assembly of the aggregates.

Increasing sequence data has made it possible to utilize related genomes, but this is not as straightforward as it may seem, as the evolution of noncoding regulatory regions is relatively poorly understood. In this work we describe a modeling framework and software implementation for aligning multiple DNA sequences to each other while simultaneously predicting functional regions in that DNA (such as the locations where proteins bind to the DNA for the purpose of regulating genes). Those functional regions may or may not be evolutionarily conserved across the sequences. Our framework allows for explicit modeling of evolutionary change across sequences in both the individual nucleotides making up the sequences and in the functional significance of the sequences (functional versus nonfunctional). While most competing frameworks and implementations are limited to a maximum number of sequences and their lengths, ours is scalable. We demonstrate the value of our system by using it to align a set of complex regulatory regions across ten Drosophila species and to predict protein-binding sites in those sequences.","In eukaryotic genomes, the binding sites of regulatory elements are often located at specific locations in the genome. In this study, we describe a new flexible framework for modeling binding site evolution in multiple related genomes, based on a phylogenetic pair of hidden Markov models that explicitly model the gain loss of binding sites in the phylogeny. We demonstrate the value of the framework for alignment of regulatory regions in inference of precise binding-site locations in regions of the DNA. Our implementation is scalable in terms of numbers of species sequence lengths and can produce alignments with binding- site predictions with accuracy rivaling that of current systems that specialize in alignment with binding site prediction. We also demonstrate the validity of the power of the model components and extensive simulations of realistic sequence data to apply specific models to study Drosophila enhancers related to the presence of gain loss binding sites. Different models can be easily specified, providing an invaluable tool for exploration of biological hypotheses that drive improvements in understanding the mechanisms of evolution and gene regulation."

How humans process and represent information associated with objects is thus a fundamental question in neuroscience. Here, we examine the representation of the mechanical properties of objects which define the mapping between the forces applied to an object and the motion that results. Knowledge of this mapping, which can change depending on the orientation with which an object is grasped, is essential for skillful manipulation. Subjects performed a virtual object manipulation task by grasping the handle of a novel robotic interface which simulated the dynamics of a familiar object which could be presented at different orientations. Using this task, we show that adaptation to the properties of a particular object is extremely rapid, and that such adaptation is confined to the specific orientation at which the object is experienced. Moreover, the pattern of adaptation observed when the orientation of the object and its mechanical properties were changed from trial-to-trial was reproduced by a model which included multiple representations and a generalization function tuned for object orientation. These results suggest that the skillful manipulation of objects with familiar dynamics is mediated by multiple context-specific representations.","Motor learning has been extensively studied in dynamic (force-field) perturbations, which can induce movement errors that result in adaptive changes in motor commands. However, the mechanisms by which motor learning adapts to these changes are not well understood. Here, we use state-space models to explain how trial-to-trial errors can drive progressive adaptation observed in studies of motor learning. We apply these models to an adaptation involving novel dynamics, which typically occurs over tens of thousands of trials, which appears to be mediated by a dual-rate adaptation process. In contrast, manipulating objects with familiar dynamics, subjects adapt rapidly over hundreds of trials. Our model predicts that exposure to an object with multiple orientations, the degree of independence of adaptation in de-adaptation in context, and states associated with contexts slowly de-Adapt exposure to a particular context can confirm predictions of new experiments. Our current study highlights similarities between the processes engaged in exposure to novel versus familiar dynamics. In both cases, adaptation is mediated by multiple context-specific representations. In the case of familiar object dynamics, representations engaged based on visual context, the updated single-rate process mediates adaptation."

This was not foreseen by Gause’s seminal competitive exclusion theory, which predicted that simple single niche environments cannot support diversity. We now know that cross-feeding interactions can be a major driver of diversity maintenance in simple environments. Cross-feeding, a relationship wherein one organism consumes metabolites excreted by another, is a ubiquitous feature of natural and clinically-relevant microbial communities and even tumour cell populations. However, it remains unclear how readily such relationships form, and therefore our ability to predict their emergence is limited. Here we developed a mathematical model of cross-feeding and find that this system can display complex dynamics including multi-stable behaviour separated by a critical point. Therefore, the emergence of cross-feeding depends on complex interplay between density and frequency of competitors. Moreover we predict that small changes in environmental conditions can cause abrupt and irreversible shifts from cross-feeding permissive to cross-feeding prohibitive states. We argue that mathematical models are essential tools for disentangling the complexities of cross-feeding interactions.","Cross-feeding, the relationship between an organism and its metabolites excreted, is a ubiquitous feature of natural and clinically-relevant microbial communities and a key factor promoting diversity in extreme and/or nutrient-poor environments. However, it remains unclear how readily cross-feeding interactions form, and the ability to predict their emergence is limited. In this paper, we developed a mathematical model that accurately captures the short-term dynamics of competitors observed empirically and use it to systematically explore the stability of cross-filling interactions in a range of environmental conditions. We find that cross-fed interactions form depends on complex interplay between density frequency and competitors concentration and resources in the environment. We also find that subtly different environmental conditions lead to dramatically different results in establishment and cross- feeding, and explain apparently unpredictable-population differences in experimental outcomes. We argue that mathematical models are essential tools for disentangling the complexities of cross–feeding interactions."

Absence of safe and cost effective anti-leishmanial drugs, together with emergence of drug resistance and HIV co-infection have posed a serious challenge to the disease containment. Given the urgent need to prevent approximately 0.2 to 0.4 million new VL cases annually worldwide, all reasonable efforts to achieve a safe and effective Leishmania vaccine should be made. We have previously reported the protective properties of the rA2 protein against experimental L. infantum infections both in mice and canines. To further evaluate the efficacy of A2 in a more relevant animal model to human disease, we used the primate Macaca mulatta. Primates vaccinated with different rA2-based prime-boost regimes displayed varying degrees of protective immunity, as indicated by a marked reduction of symptoms and parasite burden in the liver. In particular the vaccination approach with non-replicative adenovirus vector expressing A2 (rAd5-A2) and boosted with the rA2 protein resulted in a more efficient control of parasites as well as resolution of hepatic immune granulomas at 24 weeks post-infection. The clinical efficacy provided by A2 in an animal model that is evolutionary close to humans qualifies this antigen as a promising candidate vaccine against human VL.","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe vector-born disease in humans and dogs caused by Leishmania donovani complex parasites. Approximately 0.2 0.4 million new human VL cases occur annually worldwide. In this new world, alarming numbers are primarily due to the impracticality of current control methods based on vector reduction and dog euthanasia. Therefore, a prophylactic vaccine appears essential for VL control. The current efforts to develop an efficacious vaccine include use of animal models close to human and macaque infection models to determine vaccine candidates worthy of development. Here, we show that a recombinant A2 (rA2) protein protects against experimental L. infantum infections in mice and dogs. Primates were vaccinated with rA2-based prime-boost immunization regimes: doses of recombinant human interleukin-12 (rhIL-12) and adsorbed alum (RA2/rhIL12/ alum) followed by doses of non-replicative adenovirus recombinant vector encoding A2, followed by boosts of rA5-A2+rA1/rhil12/alum. Protection correlated with hepatic granuloma resolution, reduction in clinical symptoms, particularly in primates vaccinated with Ad5- A2+RA1+Ad5-a2 protocol.

Using the fruit fly as an in vivo model system, we reveal that LKB1 kinase activity is critical for lipid storage and controls the lipolysis pathway in the fat body, which is equivalent to mammalian adipose and liver tissue. We find that the lipolytic defects of LKB1 mutants are rescued by the expression of constitutively active SIK3 in the fat body. We show that LKB1 and SIK3 regulate lipid storage by altering the gene expression of brummer, the Drosophila homolog of human adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a critical lipolytic gene. We also identify that LKB1-SIK3 signaling controls the nuclear and cytosolic localization of the class IIa deacetylase HDAC4 via SIK3-dependent phosphorylation in feeding and fasting conditions, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that the LKB1-SIK3-HDAC4 pathway plays a critical role in maintaining fly lipid homeostasis in response to dietary conditions.","LKB1 plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis by regulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPPK) and AMPK-related kinases, including salt-inducible kinases (SIKs). However, the roles of LKB1 in lipid metabolism are poorly understood. Here, we show that Drosophila SIK3 mutants display decreased lipid storage and increased gene expression in brummer, a member of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) family. These phenotypes are consistent with the expression of a constitutively active SIK1 in the fat body, suggesting that SIK4 is a key downstream kinase of Lkb1. Furthermore, we identify HDAC4, a class IIa histone deacetylase, as a lipolytic target of the LKB 1-SIK3 pathway. Interestingly, we found that the activity of this pathway was modulated by dietary conditions. We also found that short-term fasting, adipokinetic hormone (AKH) pathway, related to the mammalian glucagon pathway, inhibits kinase activity of the lipid storage pathway. These data suggest that fasting stimuli specifically control the kinase activities of the lipolysis pathway and that this pathway may establish a converging point between feeding and fasting signals to control lipid homeostostasis."

However, the determination of atomic structures for all these states with conventional high-resolution approaches can be very challenging due to inherent difficulties in high yield purification of functional membrane transport proteins. Various complementary structural information of proteins in their native states can be obtained by a variety of biophysical and biochemical methods with site-directed mutations. Here, a novel restrained molecular dynamics structural refinement method is developed to help derive a structural model that is consistent with experimental data by incorporating all the experimental constraints simultaneously through the use of non-interacting all-atom molecular fragments. The method can be easily and effectively extended to incorporate many kinds of structural constraints from a variety of biophysical and biochemical experiments, and should be very useful in generating and refining models of proteins in specific functional states.","Understanding the function of multiple conformational states is a prerequisite to understand the function and function of membrane transport proteins. Unfortunately, determination of detailed atomic structures of functionally important conformational state in conventional high-resolution approaches is difficult. In some cases, biophysical biochemical approaches provide important complementary structural information that can be exploited to help advance computational methods to derive structural models of specific conformations. In particular, functional spectroscopic measurements of a combination of site-directed mutations constitute an important source of information to obtain mixed-resolution structural models. A common problem in this strategy is the difficulty to simultaneously integrate information from multiple independent experiments involving different mutations in chemical labels to derive a unique structural model consistent with the data. To resolve this issue, a novel restrained molecular dynamics structural refinement method was developed to simultaneously incorporate multiple experimentally determined constraints (e.g., engineered metal bridges and spin- labels) and treated individual molecular fragment atomic details. The internal structure of molecular fragments is treated realistically, and interaction between different molecular fragments avoids unphysical steric clashes. The information of the molecular fragments exploited simultaneously constrain the backbone of the backbone to refine a three-dimensional model of the conformational status of the protein. This method illustrated the feasibility of refining the structure of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of the Kv1.2 potassium channel in the resting state by exploring the distance of histograms of spin-labels attached to T4 lysozyme."

Expression of different Lewis or ABO blood group types has been shown to be associated with risk of different enteric infections. For example, individuals of blood group O have a higher risk of severe illness due to V. cholerae compared to those with non-blood group O antigens. In this study, we have determined the relationship of the Lewis blood group antigen phenotypes with the risk of symptomatic cholera as well as the severity of disease and immune responses following infection. We show that individuals expressing the Le(a+b−) phenotype were more susceptible to symptomatic cholera, while Le(a–b+) expressing individuals were less susceptible. Individuals with the Le(a–b−) blood group had a longer duration of diarrhea when infected, required more intravenous fluid replacement, and had lower plasma IgA antibody responses to V. cholerae LPS on day 7 following infection.

One of these lipids, C16:0 platelet activating factor (PAF), is specifically elevated in brains of Alzheimer's patients. As elevated exposure to C16:0 PAF ultimately leads to neuronal death, it is crucial to identify underlying mechanisms that mitigate the toxic effects of this lipid. In this study we exploit the conserved biology between humans and baker's yeast to identify key genes that are essential to buffer the toxic effects of C16:0 PAF. We found that Srf1, or Spo14 Regulatory Factor 1, the previously uncharacterized protein Ydl133w, is essential for mitigating the toxic effects of C16:0 PAF in yeast. We determine that Srf1 interacts with yeast phospholipase D (PLD) Spo14 and is required for PLD activity in mitotic cells. Hence we discovered a novel regulator of PLD in yeast. Further, we extend our studies to higher eukaryotes demonstrating that PLD is required to buffer the neurotoxic effect of C16:0 PAF.

They propagate by forming a complex consisting of the catalytically active intron RNA and an intron-encoded reverse transcriptase (which converts the RNA to DNA, which can then be reinserted in the host genome). The Ll.LtrB group II intron-encoded protein (LtrA) was found previously to localize to bacterial cellular poles, potentially accounting for the preferential insertion of Ll.LtrB in the replication origin (oriC) and terminus (ter) regions of the Escherichia coli chromosome, which are located near the poles during much of the cell cycle. Here, we identify E. coli genes whose disruption leads both to more diffuse LtrA localization and a more uniform chromosomal distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites, proving that the location of the LtrA protein contributes to insertion-site preference. Surprisingly, we find that LtrA localization in the disruptants is affected by the accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate, which appears to bind basic proteins and delocalize them away from the cellular poles. Thus, polyphosphate, a ubiquitous but enigmatic molecule in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, can localize proteins to different sites of action, with potentially wide physiological consequences.","Mobile group II introns consist of the catalytic intron RNA and intron-encoded protein reverse transcriptase activity, which act as a ribonucleoprotein particle to promote DNA integration into intron mobility.

In this study, we use a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model of Shigella infection to discover new roles for the cytoskeleton in inflammation and infection control. Septins, a poorly understood component of the cytoskeleton, are important in numerous biological processes including cell division and host-pathogen interactions. Here, we show that zebrafish septins can restrict inflammation and Shigella infection in vivo. In the absence of septins, larvae infected with Shigella exhibit increased mortality and bacterial burdens associated with increased Caspase-1 activity and neutrophil death. Pharmacological suppression of Il-1β signaling rescues septin-deficiency in vivo by reducing neutrophil death and preventing larval mortality.

The parasite is typically spread through the feces of a blood-sucking ‘kissing bug’ insect. Despite many documented cases in dogs across Texas, there are few population-level research studies investigating canine Chagas disease in multi-dog kennels in Texas. We sampled a total of 86 dogs from three kennels in south central Texas. We found 58% of the dogs had antibodies indicating they had been exposed to the parasite, and 17% of the dogs had parasite DNA circulating in their blood. We found that over 80% of kissing bugs collected from the kennels were infected. Further, using a bloodmeal analysis technique, we detected that all tested bugs had recently fed on dog blood. Our findings indicate that dog kennels can serve as an environment where kissing bugs and dogs interact, and that outdoor, multi-dog kennels in areas with kissing bugs are high risk areas for Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in dogs.","Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease in the Americas.

We also found that dogs harbored parasite DNA in blood, including seronegative seropoitive dogs. Molecular screening of organs opportunistically sampled from seroposed dogs revealed that parasite DNA was present in the heart, uterus, and mammary tissues. Strain- typing showed parasite discrete typing units (DTU) TcI and TcIV present in dog samples, including co-occurrence of DTUs with individual dogs. Bloodmeal analysis of Triatoma gerstaeckeri and Triatomatoma sanguisuga insects collected from the kenneling revealed exclusively dog DNA. Vector infection with the parasite was 80.6%. Vector infection of T.cruzi was associated with an unmeasured and undoubtedly significant financial consequences for working dogs highly trained and highly valued."

A key mechanism for global switches of the transcriptional program depends on alternative sigma factors that bind the RNA polymerase core enzyme and direct it towards the appropriate stress response genes. Competition of different sigma factors for a limited amount of RNA polymerase is believed to play a central role in this global switch. Here, a theoretical approach is used towards a quantitative understanding of sigma factor competition and its effects on gene expression. The model is used to quantitatively describe in vitro competition assays and to address the question of indirect or passive control in the stringent response upon amino acids starvation. We show that sigma factor competition provides a mechanism for a passive up-regulation of the stress specific sigma-driven genes due to the increased availability of RNA polymerase in the stringent response. Moreover, we find that active separation of sigma factor from the RNA polymerase during early transcript elongation weakens the sigma factor-RNA polymerase equilibrium constant, raising the question of how their in vitro measure is relevant in the cell.","Sigma factors control global switches in the genetic expression program of bacteria. Different sigma factors compete for the binding of a limited pool of RNA polymerase (RNAP) core enzymes, providing a mechanism to cross-talk genes and gene classes sharing the expression machinery. To analyze the contribution of sigma factor competition to global changes in gene expression, we develop a theoretical model that describes the binding and non-specific binding of core RNAPs, transcription, non-binding DNA and modulation of the availability of molecular components. Our model validated a comparison of in vitro and in vitro competition experiments, excellent agreement was found. Transcription affected modulation concentrations of different types of holoenzymes, whereas saturated promoters were weakly affected by sigmafactor competition. In the case of overlapping promoters, the saturated promoters are more strongly affected by these types of factors. Active transcription effectively lowers the affinity of the Sigma factor for the core enzyme, resulting in complex cross- talk effects. Our theoretical analysis provides support for a significant role for passive control of the global switch in the gene expression program."

This study addresses the mechanism of nucleosome positioning by NoRC and the functional role of the non-coding RNA, which is termed pRNA because it corresponds to the promoter sequence. NoRC recognises the promoter nucleosome in a chromatin array with high affinity and uses a release mechanism to position the nucleosome over the transcription initiation site. The pRNA binds specifically to NoRC and inhibits its ATPase activity. We suggest that the RNA retains NoRC at the gene promoter after remodeling, linking its chromatin modification and scaffolding activity to inactive rDNA copies.","Active repressed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are characterised by specific epigenetic marks on differentially positioned nucleosomes and promoters. Repression of rRNA genes requires the non-coding RNA (pRNA) presence of the nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC). ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes are essential regulators of DNA-dependent processes, and regulation occurs through modulation of DNA accessibility to chromatin. Here, we demonstrate that NoRC binds to the promoter of the rRNA gene promoter; the mechanism of nucleosome positioning, nucleosomal placed at the transcription initiation site; and the functional role of pRNA. We demonstrate that pRNA is capable of recognising the binding of the promoter to the nucleosomer, and that it binds to higher affinity of the DNA positioned at non-repressed positions. NoRC also recognises the promoter and the chromatin array positions of the two sites. Our results suggest that pRNAs play a key role in the regulation of chromatin modification activity."

We discovered genes that confer resistance to a number of neglected antibiotics, expanding our knowledge of gene function and antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli K-12. Starting from this large-scale screen, we then investigated how two antibiotics with a common history, kasugamycin and blasticidin S, enter bacterial cells. Both mimic naturally occurring nutrients to trick E. coli into actively bringing them inside. Kasugamycin is used to control microbes that cause agricultural diseases and mutations that reduce uptake like those we describe here may be an underappreciated factor in the development of resistance to kasugamycin.","Antibiotic resistance is a major public health problem in the developing world.

One important cause of infant mortality worldwide is infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the pneumococcus. All pneumococcal disease begins with asymptomatic colonization of the upper respiratory tract. Infants are also more likely to carry pneumococci, and on average each carriage event has a longer duration. Here, we used an infant mouse model of pneumococcal colonization to study the mechanisms underlying delayed clearance of carriage. We found that infant mice were unable to recruit the effector cells of clearance, macrophages, into the lumen of the upper airway, and that this delay was accompanied by an inability to produce a macrophage chemoattractant in the nasopharynx. We attribute this defect to a dysregulation in the expression of these chemokines and show this effect results from the commensal bacterial flora of infants. Our findings provide an explanation for why infants are more susceptible to being colonized with and infected by pneumococci.","Infections are a common cause of infant mortality worldwide, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae. Colonization is a prerequisite for invasive pneumococcal disease, particularly in prolonged children. However, the mechanisms underlying susceptibility are unknown. Here, we show that infant mice exhibit prolonged pneumococc carriage, delayed recruiting macrophages, effector cells for clearance, and in the nasopharyngeal lumen. The lack of macrophage recruitment paralleled a failure to upregulate chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2 (Ccl2 Mcp-1) in adult mice, which is required for clearance. Baseline expression of Ccl2 and related chemokines is higher in infant compared to the adult upper respiratory tract, and this effect requires the infant microbiota.

Here, we developed a novel tool: MTB antigen-specific tetrameric CD4+ T-cell receptor (TCR) complexes that can detect MTB peptide-specific antigen presenting cells (APCs) in blood and local tissues. We found that a relatively low level of antigen-specific monocytes (i.e., APCs) was detected in peripheral blood (PBL) samples from untreated TB patients, and then increased to their peak levels during the first month after treatment, which probably had something to do with the decrease in APC apoptosis. Our research provides a new method for tracking dynamic changes in APCs that are associated with TB infection and latent TB infection, and an additional tool for the studies of TB immunity and its pathogenesis.","Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in patients with advanced convalescent tuberculosis (TB) have been characterized.

Studying the DNA repair machinery of this parasite could provide us with good insights about T. cruzi biology and virulence. We focused on the 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) DNA lesion and its repair system. This lesion is considered particularly deleterious because it can generate DNA double strand breaks if inserted during the DNA replication. Our approach to investigating the importance of the 8-oxoG repair system in T. cruzi was to generate a parasite population expressing the Escherichia coli MutT enzyme, which is responsible for removing 8-oxo-dGTP from the nucleotide pool. Different parameters such as growth curves, cell infection experiments, antioxidants, enzymes expression, and DNA lesion quantification were used to study this modified parasite in comparison with a control WT population. We also characterized a gene in T. cruzi that has functional homology with the E. coli MutT gene. The overexpression of this gene in T. cruzi caused the same phenotypes observed when we expressed the heterologous gene. Overall, the results indicate the importance of this DNA repair enzyme for T. cruzi resistance to oxidative stress and improving its proliferative ability in the vertebrate host.","Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi causes DNA lesions, which result in genomic instability and lead to cell death. Guanine base is susceptible to oxidation, low redox potential, and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is a common lesion. The characteristics of 8-oG are a good cellular biomarker to indicate the extent of oxidative stress. When repaired, 8-OxoG is inserted into DNA replication, which can generate double-strand breaks, which makes the lesion particularly deleterious. To address oxidative stress situations, the mammalian intracellular environment of the triatomine insect gut replicates. We focused on the MutT enzyme, which is responsible for removing 8-OXoG from the nucleotide pool. MutT is expressed in T. cruzi parasites and is heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and MutT overexpressing the TcMTH enzyme. In epimastigote form, recombinant wild-type parasites displayed similar growth under normal conditions, but MutT-expressing cells were resistant to hydrogen peroxide treatment. In addition, the recombinant parasite displayed significantly increased growth in 48 hours after infection in fibroblasts and macrophages compared to wild-types cells, and increased parasitemia in Swiss mice. These results indicate that, in western blotting experiments, MutT heterologous expression can influence parasite antioxidant enzyme protein levels."

During wound healing epidermal keratinocytes become migratory to close the wound. The transition of keratinocytes between these three different states—progenitor, differentiation and migration-requires the activation of distinct gene expression programs whose regulation is poorly understood. Our study demonstrates how regulatory chromatin domains like typical enhancers and super enhancers interact with transcription factors, resulting in complex layers of regulation with specific transcription factors regulating distinct stages of the epidermal differentiation process. Specifically, the epidermal transcription factor GRHL3 regulates both possible transitions of progenitor epidermal cell: differentiation and migration. We found that both GRHL3 chromatin binding and enhancers relocate as keratinocytes move between functional states. In addition, we show reciprocal regulation between GRHL3 and enhancers: chromatin domains, including a super enhancer, regulate GRHL3 expression, while GRHL3 regulates the formation of a subset of epidermal super enhancers and typical enhancers.","Transcription factor binding, chromatin modifications, and large scale chromatin- organization underlie progressive, irreversible cell lineage commitments to differentiation. We know little about how chromatin changes in cells as they enter transient, reversible states of migration. We show that the human progenitor of keratinocytes differentiate and migrate in a unique state. These super-enhancers are enriched in skin disease sequence variants. GRHL3, a transcription factor that promotes differentiation and migration, binds preferentially to super- enhancers differentiating from keratinocyte, migration, and binds to the promoters of REST, repressing expression of migration inhibitors. We also show that chromatin relocates to GRHL 3 binding enhancers and represses the formation of a number of non-keratinocyte super-enriched enhancers. These results suggest that the irreversible commitment of progenitors to their differentiation is reversible."

HPVs that infect mucosal epithelia cause infectious lesions in the anogenital tract and oral cavity. HPV infections are normally cleared by the immune system; however, in rare cases, infections can persist for years. Persistent infections by certain HPVs place one at a high risk of developing carcinomas of the cervix, other anogenital tissues, and the head/neck region. These HPVs are responsible for over 5% of all human cancers. For an HPV infection to persist, the viral circular genome must be maintained, i.e. replicated and inherited during cell division. In this study we define the mechanism by which the viral gene E6 contributes to the maintenance of the HPV genome. We demonstrate that E6 must inactivate the cellular factor, p53, for the viral genome to be maintained. Significantly, p53, is inactivated in many types of human cancers and because much research has been done on p53, promising new drugs have been identified that can re-activate p53. If such drugs can re-activate the p53 that has been inactivated by E6, then we hypothesize that these drugs could be used to cure patients with persistent HPV infections and thereby reduce their risk of developing HPV associated cancers.","The human papillomavirus genome undergoes three distinct stages of replication: establishment, maintenance and amplification. The HPV16 E6 protein is required for the maintenance of the HPV16 DNA genome in the extrachromosomal, nuclear plasmid of the natural host cell, the human keratinocyte. Based on mutational analyses, we found that inactivation of p53 E6, necessarily E6-mediated degradation by p53, did not correlate with the ability of E6 to support maintenance of HPV16. Inactivation of the dominant negative p53 rescued the ability to replicate HPV16 and E6STOP E6SAT mutant genomes and replicate their extrachromeosomal genomes, but not to the degree observed with HPV16 or E6 in the wild-type (WT) genome. We conclude that inactivating p53 is necessary for maintaining HPV16, 18 and 31 genomes in the context of persistent infections."

Telomeric DNA is maintained though the action of both conventional and non-conventional DNA replication mechanisms. To ensure that chromosome ends are fully protected and fully replicated, telomeres dynamically oscillate between a closed (non-extendable) and an open (extendable) conformation throughout the cell cycle. The telomerase reverse transcriptase engages telomeres when they are in an extendable conformation. How this conversion occurs, how telomerase is recruited to the chromosome terminus and how telomerase action is terminated are unanswered questions. Here we provide evidence that POT1a, a telomerase accessory protein from the flowering plant Arabidopsis, helps to convert the telomere into a telomerase-extendable state through dynamic interactions with a critical telomere binding protein complex, and through stimulation of telomerase enzyme activity. The results of this study provide new insight into the regulation of telomeric DNA replication.","Protection of Telomeres 1 (POT1) is a conserved nucleic acid binding protein implicated in telomere replication and chromosome end protection.

In this paper, we administered a monoclonal antibody that blocks the common type I IFN signaling receptor to mice at different times after WNV infection to dissect the temporal functions of IFN. Administration of the blocking antibody at day -1 resulted in a massive increase in viral replication and the number of WNV-specific -CD8+ T cells. In contrast, treatment with a single dose of antibody at day 4 had limited effects on viral dissemination, but instead promoted development of dysfunctional CD8+ T cells that produced lower levels of cytokines and expressed proteins implicated in T cell exhaustion. Thus, we show a stage-specific effect of type I IFN in optimal maturation of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses. Our study provides new insight as to how and when innate immune signals affect maturation of antiviral CD8+ T cells after the initial priming event with viral antigen.","West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne viral pathogen that infects millions of people worldwide.

In addition, PRL1 is an RNA-binding protein, binds pri-miRNAs in vivo and positively influences the levels of pri-miRNAs levels without affecting the promoter activities of genes encoding pri-miRNAs. These results suggest that PRL1 may also stabilize pri-miRNAs. We further show that RPL1 and its interactor CDC5 (a DNA-binding protein) synergistically regulate pri-miRNA levels, resulting in enhanced effects on miRNA accumulation, although they function together as a complex to facilitate DCL1 activity.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are required for the production of microRNAs.

In the visual system, high-level auditory neurons represent behaviorally relevant signal range in listening conditions. We found that neurons in the secondary area of the avian auditory cortex exhibit noise-invariant responses in terms of responses modulations of the temporal spectral envelope of sound, and that noise invariance is partly achieved by selectively responding to long sounds with sharp spectral structure. Finally, we demonstrate that a biologically inspired noise- filtering algorithm performs state-of-the-art de-noising algorithms for clinical and consumer oriented applications.

The ability of L. pneumophila to invade and proliferate within macrophages and protozoa is dependent on the translocation of specific proteins into the invaded cell via a specialized secretory device, and these proteins modulate various host cell processes. Of these translocated proteins, AnkB is indispensable for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila within macrophages and protozoa. Here we show that AnkB is essential for establishing a favorable intracellular replicative niche by promoting the decoration of the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV) with polyubiquitinated proteins. The AnkB effector achieves this by mimicking the action of host cell F-box proteins, a highly conserved component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that is found in both unicellular organisms and mammalian cells. Our study provides new insights into the ability of intracellular pathogens to hijack evolutionarily conserved host cell processes through molecular mimicry to establish a favorable replicative niche within various hosts and to cause disease in mammals.","The ability of Legionella pneumophila to proliferate in the aquatic environment of macrophages indicates a remarkable evolution of microbial exploitation and evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic processes. Ankyrin B (AnkB) is a non-canonical F-box-containing protein, known as Dot/Icm-transocated effector, that is essential for intra-vacuolar proliferation in protozoan hosts. AnkB is a conserved domain of the F-Box domain of AnkB that is required for intracellular bacterial proliferation and rapid acquisition of polyubiquitinated proteins from Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) macrophage, Dictyostelium discoideum, Acanthamoeba. Interestingly, translocation of AnkBs to macrophaging and Acthamoebas rapidly triggered extracellular bacteria within 5 min of bacterial attachment. Ectopically expressed AnkB in mammalian cells localized to the periphery of cell co-localizes with host SKP1 and recruits polyubsiquitination proteins, which results in restoration of intracellar growth in ankB mutant. In contrast, the ectopically expressing AnkB-9L10P/AA variant localized to cell periphery, which fails to trans-rescue ankB- mutant intracelellular growth defect. In vivo interaction with AnkB with the AnkB AnkB and the K-terminal SKP-1 variant of the K/A variant of L. pneumoniae showed that the expression of the protein is non-permissive for intraculmonary bacterial proliferation in the mouse model of Legionnaires' disease.

Shotgun “metagenomic” sequencing can be used to sample millions of short DNA sequences from such communities directly, without needing to first culture its constituents in the laboratory. Using these data, researchers can survey which functions are encoded by mapping these short sequences to known protein families and pathways. Several tools for this annotation already exist. But, annotation is a multi-step process that includes identification of genes in a metagenome and determination of the type of protein each gene encodes. We currently know little about how different choices of parameters during annotation influences the final results. In this work, we systematically test how several key decisions affect the accuracy and speed of annotation, and based on these results, develop new software for annotation, which we named ShotMAP. We then use ShotMAP to functionally characterize marine communities and gut communities in a clinical cohort of inflammatory bowel disease. We find several functions are differentially represented in the gut microbiome of Crohn’s disease patients, which could be candidates for biomarkers and could also offer insight into the pathophysiology of Crohn’s. ShotMAP is freely available (https://github.com/sharpton/shotmap).","Metagenomic DNA sequencing is a widely applicable tool for characterizing the functions encoded by microbial communities.

We apply ShotMAP data obtained from the clinical microbiome investigation of inflammatory bowel disease. Our analysis finds that gut microbiota collected from Crohn's disease patients and patients with ulcerative colitis are functionally distinct from healthy controls. This differential abundance of metabolic pathways related to host-microbiome interactions may serve as putative biomarkers for disease."

While current genotyping techniques based on MLVA (multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis) can identify within-host diversity, standard methods for classifying the mechanism driving this diversity have limitations. We present ClassTR, a novel approach for classifying these types of complex infections. ClassTR uses optimization to resolve complex strains into simple strains and explicit models of tandem repeat evolution to classify the infections as clonal (due to within-host diversification) or mixed (due to reinfection). We illustrate ClassTR and validate its findings in the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. We construct simulated datasets to identify the best-performing variant of our method and find that it is significantly more accurate than the standard method of classification. We apply ClassTR to data from a study in South Africa and find substantial differences in the classifications produced by ClassTR and the standard method, demonstrating the real-world relevance of this approach.

Regulation of Bim is uniquely important in the pathogenesis of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), since in this human childhood cancer the Myc gene is deregulated by chromosomal translocation and Myc can induce pcd via Bim. Latent EBV represses Bim expression, and here we have discovered that this involves mechanisms that reprogramme B cells and their progeny. EBV does not significantly alter Bim protein or RNA stability, but relief of EBV-mediated repression by specific inhibitors suggested it involves modifications to chromatin. Consistent with this, reduced histone acetylation and increased levels of DNA methylation on the Bim promoter were found after latent EBV infection. Further analysis suggested that the DNA methylation is preceded by repression mediated via a polycomb protein repressive complex targeting the Bim gene. By initiating the heritable suppression of Bim, EBV increases the likelihood of B lymphomagenesis in general and BL in particular. This reprogramming of B cells by EBV may also play a role in the development of other chronic disorders such as autoimmune disease and suggests a general mechanism that could contribute to the pathogenesis associated with other microorganisms.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL). EBV-infected B cells express the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-family member Bim to enhance cell survival. However, EBV nuclear proteins are predominantly directed at regulating Bim mRNA synthesis, whereas post-transcriptional regulation of Bim has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic mechanisms involved in Bim-mediated repression by EBV in latently infected B cells. We found that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes were involved in the expression of the Bim promoter. We also confirmed the methylation of CpG dinucleotides located at the 5′ end of the promoter, suggesting that Bim was initially associated with a repressive epigenetic histone mark that gradually followed DNA methylation and CpGs dinucleotideides. We conclude that latent EBV initiates a chain of events that leads to epigenetic repression of the tumour suppressor gene Bim in B cells and progeny. This reprogramming of B cells may have important implications for understanding EBV persistence and pathogenesis in the pathogenesis of BL."

They are known as complex networks and statistics exist to characterize their structure. Until recently, such networks have primarily been analyzed as fixed structures, which enable interaction between their components (nodes). The present work is one of the first empirical studies investigating the adaptation of complex networks [1]. Network evolution is particularly important for applying complex network analysis to biological systems, where the evolution of the network reflects the biological processes that drive it. Here, we characterize the functional networks obtained from neurons grown in vitro. Network properties are described at seven day intervals during the neurons' maturation period. Initially, neurons formed random networks, which spontaneously reorganized to a ‘small-world’ architecture. The ‘small-world’ concept derives from the study of social networks, where it is referred to as ‘six-degrees of separation’: the connection of any two individuals by as few as six acquaintances. In brain networks, this translates to rapid interaction between neurons, mediated by a few links between locally connected clusters (cliques) of neurons. This architecture is considered optimal for efficient information processing and its spontaneous emergence in cultured neurons is remarkable.","Neurons exhibit complex network properties similar to those found in vivo. Starting random seeding, neurons undergo a significant reorganization during the initial period of development, despite providing an ideal platform for observing developmental changes in neuronal connectivity. However, little is known about how the complex functional network evolves in isolated neurons. In this study, we show that the evolution of functional connectivity in cultured neurons is estimated by correlations between spontaneous activity and network properties. Network properties are quantified by complex measures of graph theory. Networks obtained from young cultures (14 days in vitro) exhibited random topology, evolved small-world topology and increased age. The topology change was accompanied by an increased presence of highly connected areas ( hubs) and network efficiency increased with age. Small-World topology balances integration of network areas and segregation of specialized processing units. The emergence of network structure in cultured cells, despite lack of external input, points to complex intrinsic biological mechanisms. Moreover, functional network cultures mature at ages that are highly suited to complex processing tasks."

Aflatoxins are the most potent naturally occurring carcinogens known and aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus show extensive genetic and mycotoxin diversity. Population genetic studies and experimental matings in the laboratory have revealed the underlying genetic mechanisms and adaptive processes that create and maintain aflatoxin diversity. These studies provided unequivocal evidence of meiosis, crossing over, and aflatoxin heritability, but whether these processes directly influence genetic diversity in nature with respect to aflatoxin formation is not clear. Here, our work with A. flavus, A. parasiticus and A. minisclerotigenes from fields in different continents shows that populations with higher mean recombination rates exhibit less variability in aflatoxin profiles due to genetic intermixing, whereas populations with lower recombination rates have greater variability in aflatoxin profiles due to increased fixation of specific toxin chemotypes. Therefore, sexuality generates novel toxin chemotypes but tends to equalize toxin differences in populations. Our study highlights how an understanding of variation in mating-type frequency, fertility and recombination in these fungi is crucial for the selection of nontoxigenic biocontrol strains for long-term reduction of aflatoxins in target regions.","Aflatoxins are produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus in oil-rich seed grain crops. They are a carcinogenic natural compound known as aflatoxin B1. Sexual reproduction occurs between individuals belonging to different vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs). We examined natural genetic variation in 758 isolates of A. flavus, A. parasiteus and a. minisclerotigenes sampled from a single peanut field in the United States (Georgia), Africa (Benin), Argentina (Córdoba), Australia (Queensland), and India (Karnataka). We found that genetic recombination rates were significantly different between VCGs. We also found that the proportions of MAT1-1 and MAT-2 were highly variable in populations fixed to specific toxin chemotype classes, suggesting asexual sexual reproduction fixation and maintenance. We tested the null hypothesis that an equal number of mating-type individuals were associated with a sexually recombining population. Our results suggest that the reproductive nature of the population (sexual versus asexual) is predictive of aflatoxoxin chemotype diversity in agriculturally important fungi."

Cells employ a remarkable diversity of processes to maintain its homeostasis at all levels of gene expression, including chromatin remodeling, mRNA expression and degradation, translation and protein degradation. Each of these processes shapes cell response at different time scales. In this study, we analyzed the cellular response to oxidative stress at the level of translation. Translation, as one of the most downstream processes in gene expression, provides the necessary plasticity for immediate changes of cellular activities. Using high-sensitive approaches to probe the structural integrity of cellular tRNAs, we show that upon exposure to oxidative stress tRNAs are rapidly deactivated by a cleavage within their ubiquitous, single-stranded 3′-CCA termini by oxidative stress-activated nuclease, angiogenin. The CCA-ends deactivation is reversible and quickly repairable by a ubiquitous enzyme, CCA-adding enzyme, whose natural function is to attach post-transcriptionally the CCA overhang to the 3′-termini of all tRNAs in an mRNA template-independent manner. We propose that this is a mechanism to dynamically repress and reactivate translation at low metabolic costs.","Stress-induced changes in gene expression are crucial for the survival of eukaryotic cells.

Thus, different tissues within an organism must develop specific immune systems for survival. The epidermis acts as a physical barrier and represents a first line of defense against infection and physical injury in a variety of animals. Natural nematophagous fungi, such as Drechmeria coniospora and Clonostachys rosea, infect the epidermis of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans by producing conidia. Here we demonstrated that the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in the epidermis has a direct role in C. elegans defense against fungal infection and physical injury. We found that the EGL-30/EGL-8/IP3/ITR-1 signaling pathway triggers epidermal Ca2+ release through IP3 and its receptor ITR-1 after fungal infection. Ca2+ release induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating a dual-oxidase BLI-3. ROS in turn mediate DAF-16 activation in a Ste20-like kinase-1/CST-1-dependent manner. Thus, DAF-16 could act in a cell-autonomous way in the epidermis as an active regulator of immune responses to fungal infection and physical injury.","The Caenorhabditis elegans DAF-16 transcription factor is critical for many diverse biological processes, particularly longevity and stress resistance. Disruption of the Gαq signaling cascade promotes Daf-16 activation, confers resistance to killing pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Here, we show that daf-15 mutants exhibit similar sensitivity to bacteria in wild-type animals, suggesting that DAF is normally activated by bacterial pathogens. In addition, we demonstrate that the Ca2+ release of Ca2+, a dual-oxidase, leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS.

First, we systematically studied the biological roles of eight histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) genes in the phytopathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We investigated their roles, especially focusing on their involvement in infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity. The results showed that the eight KMTs were involved in various infection processes to varying degrees, and that MoSET1, one of the KMTs catalyzing methylation at histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), had the largest impact on the pathogenicity of the fungus. Second, we focused on the role of MoSET1 in global gene regulation. H3K4 methylation is generally believed to be an epigenetic mark for gene activation in higher eukaryotes. However, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SET1 was originally characterized as being required for transcriptional silencing of silent mating-type loci. We addressed this apparent discrepancy by examining genome-wide gene expression and H3K4 methylation during infection-related morphogenesis in M. oryzae. RNA-seq analysis of a MoSET1 deletion mutant revealed that MoSET1 was indeed required for proper gene activation and repression. ChIP-seq analyses of H3K4 methylation and MoSET1 suggested that MoSET1 could directly play a role in gene activation while MoSET1-dependent gene repression may be caused by indirect effects.","Magnaporthe oryzae is a phytopathogenic fungus that infects wheat and other plants.

The parasites that cause African sleeping sickness are transmitted between humans and livestock by the tsetse fly. Controlling the spread of the parasite by tsetse flies has been proposed as a promising strategy for reducing the incidence of sleeping sickness. One potential control method relies on releasing genetically modified tsetse that are resistant to carrying the sleeping sickness parasite. For this strategy to be successful, resistant tsetse must be able to invade the susceptible tsetse population. Here, we used a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of such a strategy and the implications for sleeping sickness prevalence in humans and livestock. We found that the strategy has the potential to eliminate sleeping sickness, provided that the genetic modification is effective at protecting against trypanosome transmission and provided that the target tsetse species comprises a large majority of the tsetse population in the release location.","African trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Sodalis, which is transmitted by the tsetse, a vector of the disease.

We provide here the first in-depth characterization of a network composed of ~600 GIs within signaling and metabolic pathways of a multicellular organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We characterize the structure of this network, and the function of GI classes found in this network. We also discuss how these GI classes contribute to the genomic robustness and the adaptive evolution of multicellular organisms.","Genetic interaction (GI) is defined as a mutation in a gene that modifies phenotypic expression associated with the mutation of a second gene. Genome-wide efforts to map GIs in yeast have revealed the structural functional properties of the GI network. This study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the robustness of yeast genetic and environmental insults, and links the existing genotype phenotype to the underlying phenotype. The significant conservation of GIs and GI network structure has been reported in distant yeast species, but the conservation is not clear in unicellular multicellular organisms. In this study, we present the first in-depth characterization of ~1.5 K GIs of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We identify a wide-range of structural and functional properties in the genes network, including co-expression, phenotypical manifestations, relationship between protein-protein interaction and dense subnetworks (PDS) pathways, molecular biological functions, and gene essentiality and pleiotropy. Our study provides a model to understand better how GIs control system robustness and evolution."

In the present study, we identified regions of common methylation variation in five cell types, observing that these show enrichments for functional genomic features. Surprisingly, we found that these epigenetic variations can form biologically relevant networks that are specific to each cell type, often occurring near genes that have functional relevance to the cell type. Further these regions show reduced heritability, suggesting they may be responsive to environmental cues. We confirmed this by subjecting isogenic fibroblast cultures to different environmental stress. Our study provides insight into patterns of normal epigenetic variation in the human population.","Epigenetic variation in humans is characterized by high inter-individual epigenetic variation, termed Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs). VMRs occur preferentially in enhancers of 3’ UTRs and are highly correlated with variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks of low and high heritability. In this study, we identified a network of 95 co-regulated genes that enriched genes for roles in transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways of functional relevance in tissue. We found that fibroblasts and neurons networks were enriched for genes that play roles in T-cell activation; and neurons network was enriched for the expression of HOX gene clusters. We experimentally demonstrated that VMR networks were responsive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels at loci changing in coordinated fashion in a coordinated fashion to trans dependent cellular growth. Intriguingly, environmentally-responsive VMCs showed strong enrichment at imprinted loci (p<10−80), suggesting particularly sensitive environmental conditions. Our study provides a detailed map of common epigenetic variations in the human genome, showing that genetic environmental causes underlie variation."

If performance drops, we need to change our behaviour. We do this by adjusting cognitive control, an ensemble of processes through which behaviour is adapted to suit the task. In this study, we first used chronic recordings in the frontal lobe of macaque monkeys to characterise neurophysiological markers that reflect these processes: a brain potential reflecting performance monitoring and a sustained oscillatory signal reflecting cognitive control. It has been suggested that cognitive control, performance monitoring, and their neurophysiological markers are under the influence of dopamine. To understand how the input of dopamine is critical, we followed changes in the markers and performance during slow dopaminergic depletion. This protocol doubles up as a study of the early phase of Parkinson’s disease, when dopaminergic cells are dying but motor symptoms have yet to emerge. Whilst the performance monitoring potential attenuated at the end of the depletion, the performance itself did not. The oscillatory signals showed only subtle changes in comparison, despite the depletion. Together these results bring into question the simple idea that dopamine directly modulates frontal cortex, which in turn directly modulates cognition. We consider how the brain may compensate for a dopamine lesion, and whether the markers measure what we think they do. Our results question a current idea that neurophysiological markers can be directly used to predict dopamine loss in patients with conditions like Parkinson’s disease.","Dopamine is thought to directly influence the neurophysiological mechanisms of performance monitoring and cognitive control— processes critically linked to the production of adapted behaviour. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that changing dopamine levels in the frontal cortex may modify neurophysiology mechanisms of markers of frontal cortex, which in turn leads to cognitive changes. This causal chain needs to be verified. We use longitudinal recordings of frontal neurophysiologic markers for months after a progressive dopaminergic lesion in non-human primates, and provide data that fail to support the simple interaction between dopamine, frontal function, and cognition. Feedback potentials, performance-monitoring signals thought to drive successful control, ceased to differentiate between feedback valence at the end of lesion, and the clinical motor threshold. In contrast, cognitive control performance was driven by oscillatory markers of cognitive control unimpaired by the lesion. These results suggest a complex non-linear set of mechanisms engaged in the brain response to the progressive dopamine lesion and suggest that the direct causal chain of dopamine and frontal physiology is not directly predictive of dopamine loss."

The junctions observed at rearrangements typically show only a few base pairs in common between the partners, suggesting that they were formed by the end-to-end joining process, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). However, there is uncertainty about the mechanisms that actually create mutated junctions. DNA ligase IV catalyzes restorative double-strand break (DSB) joining in the canonical NHEJ pathway, but increasing evidence suggests that distinct NHEJ pathways that use DNA ligases I and/or III might be more important for mutations. We used yeast to study the in vivo consequence of having DNA ligase IV that was catalytically inactive but that nonetheless accumulated at DSBs normally. We detected mutated junctions in some assays that required DNA ligase IV protein but not its catalytic activity. This pattern suggests that DNA ligase I creates many mutated junctions when DNA ligase IV is present and that this can become a predominant mode of repair when DNA ligase IV activity is inefficient. Our yeast ligase IV mutations have properties similar to those observed in the human ligase IV syndrome, underscoring the relevance of these observations.","DNA ligase IV (Dnl4) is a specialized ligase for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Dnl4 has been implicated in many human diseases, but its role in DSB repair has been mainly examined in gene deletions. In this study, we show that dnl4 catalytic point mutants generated severely defective auto-adenylation and in vitro NHEJ activity in vivo, despite hyper- recruited DSBs supporting wild-type levels of Lif1 interaction with the assembly of Ku- and Lif1-containing complexes. Interestingly, the residual levels were especially imprecise in the mutant mutants, suggesting a role for DSB-bound Dl4 in the supporting mode of NHEJA catalyzed by a different ligase. Similarly, generation of repair joints from a distinct single-DSB assay showed that a mutation conferred significantly different imprecised joining profile than the one observed in mutant mutants. These findings suggest that Dnl 4 may promote mutagenic end joining independently of its catalytic activity, a likely mechanism involves Cdc9."

As a result, statistical inference has to rely on massive, time-intensive, simulations. The main idea of our method is to avoid the redundancy of similar computations that typically occur when different researchers independently fit the same model to their particular dataset. Instead, we propose to pool computational resources across the researchers interested in any given model. The prepaid method starts with an extensive simulation of datasets across the parameter space. The simulated data are compressed into summary statistics, and the relation to the parameters is learned using machine learning techniques. This results in a parameter estimation machine that produces accurate estimates very quickly (a 23,000 to 100,000-fold speed up compared to traditional methods).","In many fields, statistical models are of interest because they are analytically intractable and usually performed by a simulation-based method. However, these elegant methods, painstakingly slow convergence, are difficult to assess. As a result, statistical inference is greatly hampered by computational constraints. For example, given a statistical model, different users, different data sets, likely perform similar computations. Computations of the user are potentially useful for users of different datasets. We propose pooling resources of researchers to capitalize on this advantage. Specifically, we preemptively chart the entire space of possible model outcomes in a prepaid database. Using advanced interpolation techniques, the individual estimation problem is solved on the spot. The prepaid method can easily accommodate different priors and constraints on parameters. We created prepaid databases with challenging models and demonstrate that the prepaid method outperforms state-of-the-art estimation techniques in speed (23,000 to 100,000-fold speed) and accuracy, able to handle previously quasi inestimable models."

One potential solution to reduce toxicity is to use the nematicide at a lower concentration in combination with a second compound that together will produce a synergistic killing effect. That is, the use of either molecule alone at low concentrations is non-lethal, but when used together at these same concentrations, the cocktail is lethal. This strategy has two benefits. First, the killing effect is concentrated at the site of use and as the two molecules diffuse from the targeted site, toxicity is negated. Second, less of the toxic molecule is needed and therefore less is dispersed into the environment. Here, we describe our use of a model nematode called C. elegans to search for molecules that interact with aldicarb, which is one of the nematicides being phased out by environmental agencies. We identified 20 compounds that interact with aldicarb and describe how one of these, called wact-86, functions with aldicarb to kill worms. Our work provides proof-of-principle that C. elegans is a useful model for identifying compounds that positively interact with industrial nematicides and for understanding the nature of such interactions.","Parasitic nematodes are a major threat to human and animal health worldwide. The market withdrawal of nematicidal agents from unfavourable toxicities has limited available treatment options. In this study, we screened new small molecules that interact with aldicarb, a highly effective treatment for plant-transmitted nematode C. elegans. We found that 20 of these molecules interact positively with the nematicides called wact-86, a novel nematicide that can kill arrest of the growth model of the elegans worm. We also found that the carboxylesterase enzyme GES-1 hydrolyzes and inhibits the production of wact. Our work demonstrates the utility of the C. nemans platform to search for new molecules that positively interact with industrial nematicids, and provides proof-of-concept for prospective discovery efforts."

This group includes major pathogens of humans and animals as well as symbionts of protists. Unlike most other bacteria, chlamydiae alternate between two distinct developmental stages. Here we provide novel insights into the infective stage, the elementary body (EB), which has been described almost a century ago and is commonly referred to as an inert spore-like particle. Our analyses of EBs of the amoeba symbiont Protochlamydia amoebophila provide a detailed overview of their metabolism outside of, and independent from, their natural host cells. We demonstrated that these EBs are capable of respiration and are active in the major routes of central carbon metabolism, including glucose import, biosynthetic reactions, and catabolism for energy generation. Glucose starvation resulted in a rapid decline of metabolic activity in P. amoebophila EBs and a concomitant decrease in their potential to infect new host cells. The human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis was also dependent on nutrient availability for extracellular survival. The extent of metabolic activity in chlamydial EBs and its consequences for infectivity challenge long-standing textbook knowledge and demonstrate that the infective stage is far more dependent on its environment than previously recognized.","Chlamydiae is a highly successful group of obligate intracellular bacteria, members of remarkably diverse, ranging from major pathogens in humans and animals to symbionts that are ubiquitous protozoa.

In this current study, we performed in-depth characterization of metabolic capabilities of the EBs of the amoeba symbiont Protochlamydia and the prokaryotic protozoan Chlamydia trachomatis. We used a combined metabolomics approach, including fluorescence microscopy-based assays, isotope- ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), ion cyclotron resonance and Fourier transform mass spectroscopy (ICR/FT-MS), and ultra-high-throughput liquid chromatography mass spectreetry (UPLC-MS) to analyze the metabolic activity of these EBs. In addition, we identified a major route for D-glycine catabolism in the host-independent activity of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. These data strongly suggest that anabolic reactions of P. amoekophila EBs demonstrate that D-glucose availability is essential to sustain metabolic activity."

This strategy is called intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy (ISTp).Our team conducted a two-arm, open-label trial to compare the effect of the new ISTp with DP (ISTp-DP) strategy against the existing IPTp with SP (IPTp-SP) strategy (the control arm) in 1,873 pregnant women in southern Malawi, where almost all of the malaria parasites were highly resistant to SP.We found that the rate of malaria infection was high in both groups and that the new ISTp-DP strategy was not any better than the existing IPTp-SP strategy in terms of reducing malaria infection or improving pregnancy outcomes; in fact, women in the ISTp-DP arm had more malaria than women in the IPTp-SP arm.ISTp-DP with the current generation of rapid diagnostic tests is not a viable alternative strategy to replace IPTp-SP in malaria endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the high levels of resistance to SP.IPTp with SP should still be used as one of the interventions against malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa.Further studies to explore alternative drugs that can replace SP for IPTp will be required in these areas of high SP resistance.","Plasmodium infections in pregnancy remain asymptomatic, associated with maternal anemia and low birthweight. The World Health Organization recommends intermittent preventive therapy for pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) as an alternative strategy. However, the efficacy of this treatment is threatened by high-level parasite resistance. We conducted a trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of scheduled intermittent screening of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for treatment of RDT-positive women with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) as a alternative strategy for IPTp and SP. This was an open-label,-arm individually randomized superiority trial in HIV-seronegative women at sites in Malawi with high SP resistance. The intervention consisted of scheduled visits to the second trimester, 4 6 wk apart. Women in the IPTP-SP arm received a SP visit. Women who received an SP visit were screened for malaria and treated with DP. The prevalence of adverse live birth outcome was similar to those in the ISTp-DP arm (29.9%) but was higher in the Paucigravidae arm (28.8%) and in the multigravids arm (27.8%). We found that the prevalence of malaria delivery was similar in both arms (risk difference = 1.08% [95% CI −3.25%–5.41%) but that the risk difference was greater in the women with lower malaria transmission than in those with higher malaria transmission."

It is widely used for parasite control in livestock. Moxidectin (MOX) is being evaluated against Onchocerca volvulus in humans and is also widely used in veterinary medicine. Both anthelmintics are macrocyclic lactones (MLs) that act on ligand-gated chloride channels and share similar spectra of activity. Nevertheless, there are marked differences in their pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity. Usually, both MLs are remarkably safe drugs. However, there are reports of severe adverse events to IVM, in some humans with high Loa loa burdens, and IVM can be neurotoxic in animals with defects in P-glycoproteins (P-gp) in the blood-brain barrier. We have compared the in vivo neurotoxicity of IVM and MOX in P-gp-deficient mice and their accumulation in brain. We also investigated their effects on mammalian GABA receptors. We show that MOX has a wider margin of safety than IVM, even when the blood-brain barrier function is impaired, and that the neurotoxicity in vivo is related to different effects of the drugs on GABA-gated channels. These observations contribute to understanding ML toxicity and open new perspectives for possible MOX use in humans.","Anthelmintics ivermectin and moxidectin (MOX) display differences in toxicity in the host species.

We analyzed drug concentrations obtained at Day-2 and Day-4 and compared them to the targeted concentrations. At Day-2, favipiravir concentrations were significantly below but still close to the targeted concentration. At Day-4, a significant and unanticipated drop of concentrations as compared to Day-2 was observed. The origin of the lower-than-targeted concentrations and the unexpected drop could be due to severe sepsis conditions and/or to intrinsic properties of favipiravir metabolism. No significant correlation was found between the drug exposure and the virological response, indicating that it is possible that the favipiravir concentrations in the JIKI trial were not sufficient to strongly inhibit the viral replication. These findings suggest the necessity of performing dose-ranging studies with high doses of favipiravir in healthy volunteers to inform any further development of favipiravir for treatment of EVD.","Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we assessed the tolerance of favipiravir for EBOV in patients with EVD in Guinea (JIKI trial). We used a pharmacokinetic model to predict the concentrations of the drugs needed to achieve antiviral efficacy against EBOVs and to propose a relevant dosing regimen. We found that the drug concentration was significantly lower than predicted in JIKI compared to the predicted model. Moreover, the drug concentrations were slightly lower in the predicted models than in the expected model. The drug concentration experienced an unanticipated drop in Day-2 and Day-4, suggesting that the origin of the drop was due to severe sepsis conditions and/or intrinsic properties of the favipiralavir metabolism. Dose-ranging studies were performed in healthy volunteers to assess concentrations of tolerance achieved at high doses."

Epidemics of chikungunya fever have occurred in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Not until December 2013 were there reports of chikungunya virus infection occurring in the Americas. Since then, it has involved most countries in the Western Hemisphere with >1.1 million cases reported by the end of 2014. Previous data from the Réunion Island outbreak demonstrated that older patients and patients with certain chronic medical conditions may have a higher risk of severe disease. The Veterans Health Administration is the largest health care system in the United States and has facilities in U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, which has been heavily affected by this epidemic. Among Veterans in Puerto Rico, we investigated risk factors for severe disease and described all chikungunya-associated deaths. Risk for hospitalization increased with age, and for patients of the same age, was increased among those with congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or chronic lung disease. Further work is needed to determine whether prevention strategies targeted to those who may be at greatest risk for severe disease could help decrease morbidity and mortality among these populations.","Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes and transmitted by humans. The disease is rarely fatal, but the risk of severe disease increases with age and medical comorbidities. To describe the characteristics of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients with CHIKV infection, infections diagnosed in Puerto Rico, we investigated risk factors for hospitalization and hospitalization. We queried VHA national electronic medical records to identify patients who were hospitalized and who died in 2014. Demographics, clinical history, laboratory results, and outcomes were abstracted. We found that patients hospitalized and died had a higher risk of hospitalization than patients with laboratory-confirmed CHIKVs, and that patients who died had an increased risk of CHikV infection. We also found that older patients with chronic kidney disease were more likely to be hospitalized. Overall mortality rates were low, and clinicians in affected areas were aware of older patients and patients with comorbities and increased risk for severe disease."

However, variants loci explain a small proportion of familial aggregation, and likely additional variants are associated with CRC susceptibility. Genome-Wide studies of gene-environment interactions can identify variants detected by GWAS that have marginal gene effects. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of interaction between genetic variants of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking data from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics Epidemiology and Colorectals Consortium (GECCO). Interactions were tested using logistic regression. We identified an interaction between CRC risk and alcohol consumption variants in 9q22.32/HIATL1 (Pinteraction = 1.76×10−8; permuted p-value 3.51x10-8) region.

Studies in both mammalian and insect cell lines have shown that virus infection can be suppressed through inhibition of host factors by chemical compounds that therefore could be developed into transmission blocking agents. However, similar studies have not been conducted in adult mosquitoes. Here we investigated the effect of four chemical compounds (bafilomycin, mycophenolic acid, castanospermine, and deoxynojirimycin), known to inhibit the host factors vacuolar H+-ATPase (vATPase), inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and glucosidases, on dengue virus replication in adult mosquitoes. We found that bafilomycin and mycophenolic acid suppressed dengue virus replication in adult mosquito guts when they were injected prior to dengue virus infection; however, castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin did not. Ingestion of bafilomycin and mycophenolic acid also inhibited virus replication. We showed that the predicted target genes of bafilomycin and mycophenolic acid function as virus host factors in adult mosquitoes through RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Inhibition of vATPase also decreases mosquito longevity and fecundity, thereby further compromising vector capacity. Our study demonstrated that chemical compounds or double stranded RNAs (dsRNA) can be used to suppress virus infection through inhibition of host factors in adult mosquitoes, thereby rendering such approaches interesting for the development of novel transmission-blocking strategies.","Dengue virus host factors (DENV HFs) are essential for the completion of the infection cycle of the mosquito vector and vertebrate host and represent potent targets for transmission and blocking.

Paradoxically , high - risk tumors responsive effective vaccine therapy apparent lack adaptive immune resistance .","Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor found in children, and high-risk disease continues to have a poor prognosis despite multimodal therapy.A key feature of neuroblastoma tumors is their heterogeneity and the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that helps evade antitumor immunity.Checkpoint inhibitors put “the brakes” on the immune system, thus dampening the host’s immune response.The role of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a checkpoint inhibitor, in generating immune resistance that adapts to immune conditions in neuroblastoma is not well studied.Early studies of checkpoint inhibition in neuroblastoma have not been successful; thus, the benefit of blocking the programmed cell death 1 (PD1)/PD-L1 axis for enhanced immunotherapy needs to be better understood.The checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 is expressed on mouse and human neuroblastoma and is up-regulated in response to interferon gamma (IFNγ) exposure or infiltration of T cells into the tumor.Inhibiting PD-L1 in the context of tumor vaccination combined with another checkpoint inhibitor, anti-CTLA-4, cures established mouse neuroblastoma tumors.In a nonimmunogenic, aggressive mouse neuroblastoma model (AgN2a), PD-L1 expression is neither significant nor up-regulated in response to IFNγ and T-cell infiltrates, making the tumor more susceptible to vaccine therapy.Tumor infiltration of T cells and PD-L1 expression are associated with risk stratification in human tumors in which high-risk disease is lacking both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression in pretreatment tumor biopsies.PD-L1 is a nonredundant checkpoint in tumor vaccine therapy, and blocking this checkpoint in combination with whole cell vaccination and CTLA-4 inhibition enables enhanced antitumor T-cell killing.Combining appropriate checkpoint inhibitors with tumor vaccine therapy can overcome immune resistance in immunogenic neuroblastoma tumors.The use of checkpoint inhibitors alone in the treatment of nonimmunogenic (high-risk) neuroblastoma will most likely have little benefit.","Adaptive immune resistance induces an immunosuppressive tumor environment that enables immune evasion. This phenomenon results in tumor escape and progression to metastasis. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in tumors thought to inhibit tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death (PD1) by enabling adaptive immune resistance. In this study, we investigated the role of PD-l1 in mouse and human neuroblastoma immunity. We found that PD- L1 expression was associated with tumor cell killing and that the inflammatory environment in mouse neuroblastomas mimicked human disease PD-L2 expression. We also found that the immune response in high-risk tumors was associated directly with PD-LS1 expression. These findings suggest that PD–L1 plays a role in neuroblastomatous immunity and that it is a nonredundant effect of combination checkpoint inhibition and vaccine therapy."

MicroRNA deregulation is a common feature of human cancers, and numerous miRNAs have oncogenic or tumor suppressive properties. Members of the miR-34 family (miR-34a, miR-34b, and miR-34c) have been widely speculated to be important tumor suppressors and mediators of p53 function. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting this hypothesis, previous studies on miR-34 have been done in vitro or using non-physiologic expression levels of miR-34. Here, we probe the tumor suppressive functions of the miR-34 family in vivo by generating mice carrying targeted deletion of the entire miR-34 family. Our results show that the miR-34 family is not required for tumor suppression in vivo, and they suggest p53-independent functions for this family of miRNAs. Importantly, the mice generated from this study provide a tool for the scientific community to further investigate the physiologic functions of the miR-34 family.","MicroRNAs belonging to the miR-34 family have been proposed to be critical modulators of the p53 pathway and potential tumor suppressors in human cancers. To formally test these hypotheses, we generated mice carrying targeted deletion of members of the microRNA family. We found that the complete inactivation of miRNA-34 function is compatible with normal development in mice. Surprisingly, p53 function appears to be intact in the majority of the cells in the mice. However, loss of miR–34 expression leads to a slight increase in cellular proliferation in vitro, and impair p53-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, in contrast to p53–deficient mice, the mice display increased susceptibility to spontaneous, irradiation-induced, c-Myc–induced tumorigenesis. These findings suggest that miR34 plays a redundant function in p53 signaling, and suggest additional roles in the family of miRNAs."

ZC3H30 is a protein which was shown to bind to mRNAs; when it is attached to an mRNA, that mRNA is degraded. Procyclic-form trypanosomes that lack ZC3H30 grow normally under standard conditions, but were susceptible to various stresses: heat shock, and treatment with ethanol, a reducing agent, or arsenite. ZC3H30 interacts with one other protein, and both proteins migrate to RNA-protein granules after heat shock or starvation. These results, combined with others, suggest that ZC3H30 is involved in mRNA protection after stress. The conservation of the ZC3H30 gene in related parasites, including those that infect only arthropods, combined with the increased stress susceptibility of cells lacking it, suggests that ZC3H30 confers a selective advantage in the wild, where the parasites are subject to temperature fluctuations and immune attack in both the insect and mammalian hosts.","Trypanosomes rely on post-transcriptional mechanisms to control gene expression. Trypanosoma brucei ZC3H30 is an mRNA-binding protein that is expressed in the bloodstream form (which grows in mammals) and procyclic form (that grows in tsetse fly midgut). Attachment of this protein to the mRNA causes degradation of the mRNA, which is a growth defect in normal culture conditions; susceptible to wild-type cells with heat shock, starvation, or treatment with DTT, arsenite ethanol, or ethanol. Transcriptomes of the un-hyperturbed bloodstream form of trypanosomiasis lacking ZC 3H30 were indistinguishable from those of the uninfected bloodstream forms. We found that the expression of this mRNA was specific to the stress granule protein, Tb927.8.3820, and RNAi targeting the protein did not affect the expression or expression of ZC2H30.

These traits evolve rapidly in natural populations as animals seek to maximize their fitness in a given environment. For example, in mammals, lifespan, size, and fecundity vary over two order of magnitude. A key observation of evolutionary life history theory is the recognition that there are limited amount of resources available, which creates tradeoffs between competing life functions. By studying a domesticated strain of C. elegans, we identify a beneficial mutation that regulates a number of life history tradeoffs. This mutation affects a subunit of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex. Our work suggests that NURF is a master regulator of life history tradeoffs through epigenetic regulation, and a target of evolution.","Evolutionary life history theory seeks to explain how reproductive survival traits are shaped by selection and allocation of individual resources to competing life functions. However, little is known about the genetic mechanisms that control these couple tradeoffs. Here, we show that laboratory-adapted strains of C. elegans descended from a single common ancestor lived in the 1950s with differences in the number of life-history traits, including reproductive timing, lifespan, dauer formation, growth rate, and offspring number. We identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that controls 24%–75% of the total trait variance across reproductive timing and timepoints. Using CRISPR/Cas9-induced genome editing, we identified a 60 bp deletion of the 3’ end of the nurf-1 gene, an orthologous human gene encoding the BPTF component of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex. We found that the deletion of nurfs-1 is a pleiotropic regulator of the life history trade-offs underlying evolution of multiple traits in different species."

Phylogeny characterized the DENV-2 as belonging to the Southeast Asian genotype, however a distinction of two Lineages within this genotype has been identified. Furthermore, all strains presented an asparagine in E390, previously identified as a probable genetic marker of virulence. The results show a temporal circulation of genetically different viruses in Brazil, probably due to the introduction of a new viral lineage from the Caribbean, which lead to the re-emergence of this serotype after 2007, causing the most severe epidemic already described in the country.","Dengue virus (DENV) is a major public health problem in Brazil since its introduction in the 1980s.

The virulence strategy of EPEC revolves around a conserved Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) which translocates bacterial effector proteins directly into host cells. EPEC is considered to be a non-invasive pathogen which intimately adheres to host cells and polymerizes actin rich pedestals on which extracellular bacteria rest. Recently we have identified the T3SS effector EspT which activates the mammalian Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, resulting in the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia. In this study we dissect the signaling pathway utilized by EspT to nucleate membrane ruffles and demonstrate that these ruffles can promote EPEC invasion of host cells. Furthermore, we show that internalized EPEC are bound within a vacuole. We also report for the first time the ability of a bacterial pathogen to form actin comet tails across a vacuole membrane. In addition to providing novel insights into the subversion of cellular signaling by invasive pathogens, our study also breaks the long held dogma of EPEC as an extracellular pathogen and will have implications on how future EPEC infections are diagnosed and treated.","Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains are defined as extracellular pathogens that nucleate actin rich pedestal-like membrane extensions that intestinal enterocytes intimately adhere to.

One strategy to combat antibiotic resistance is the use of synergistic antibiotic pairs that, when combined, have activity that is considerably greater than the sum of each individual drug’s activity on its own. Synergistic combinations can even inhibit the growth of bacteria that are resistant to the individual treatment drugs. However, synergistic pairs are rare and difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic pairs is challenging due to scale: 1 million different pairs are possible for a relatively small collection of 1,000 small molecules. Here, we describe a high-throughput method for rapid identification of synergistic small-molecule pairs, termed the overlap2 method (O2M), that dramatically speeds up the screening process. First, we identify mutants that show the same phenotype when treated with each individual molecule in a synergistic pair, then use this information to guide screens for additional synergistic pairs. As a proof of concept, we studied the synergistic antibiotic pair trimethoprim and sulfamethizole, and we identified several additional synergistic molecules. Among these is the antiviral drug azidothymidine (AZT), which blocks bacterial DNA replication. Trimethoprim and sulfamethizole both inhibit folate biosynthesis, which is necessary for the proper synthesis of nucleotides for DNA replication and repair. We found that reduced nucleotide levels sensitize E. coli cells to AZT. When we substitute trimethoprim with other small molecules that also reduce nucleotide levels, we find that these small molecules also act synergistically with AZT. Indeed, AZT in combination with trimethoprim substitutes inhibits the growth of trimethoprim-resistant clinical isolates more potently than trimethoprim and AZT or trimethoprim and sulfamethizole. This work demonstrates that when we resolve the pathways that underlie synergistic interactions, we can then identify additional small molecules that act by similar mechanisms, providing a means to bypass antibiotic resistance.","Antibiotic-resistant infections kill approximately 23,000 people each year in the United States, despite widespread use of small-molecule antimicrobial combination therapy. Antibiotic combinations typically have an additive effect: the efficacy of a combination matches the sum of the efficacies of the antibiotic. Small molecules act synergistically with the antibiotic to produce greater additive efficacy. However, synergistic combinations are rare and historically difficult to identify. High-throughput identification of synergistic pairs has limited the scale of potential combinations: a modest collection of 1,000 small molecules involves 1 million pairwise combinations. Here, we describe a high-throughthroughput method to identify synergistic small molecules, the overlap2 method (O2 M). O2 M extracts patterns of chemical-genetic datasets, and creates a collection of mutants grown in the presence of hundreds of different small molecules. The identification of mutants that can be treated with known synergistic molecules allows us to pinpoint additional molecule combinations that can bypass drug resistance."

The loss of Filamin B, a protein component of the cell’s cytoskeletal structure, gives rise to Spondylocarpotarsal Synostosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by fusions of the vertebral bodies. Similarly, mice lacking the Filamin B protein show fusions of the vertebral bodies. We found that these fusions are caused by the early degeneration and eventual ossification of the IVDs. Our study demonstrates that this degeneration is caused by the increase in TGFβ and BMP activity, developmental pathways essential in bone and cartilage formation. These findings represent a significant step forward in our understanding of the molecular basis of IVD degeneration. as well as revealing filamin B’s role in TGFβ/BMP signaling regulation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the study of the rare disease spondylocarpotarsal synostosis in a model organism can uncover mechanisms underlying more common diseases. Finally, our findings provide a model system that will facilitate further discoveries regarding disc degeneration, which affects a significant proportion of the population.","Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions caused by loss of function of mutations in Filamin B (FLNB). FLNB acts as a signaling scaffold linking actin and cytoskleteon signal transduction systems, but the disease mechanisms and mechanisms of SCT remain unclear. Using a knockout mouse model, we found morphologic and molecular evidence that intervertebral discs (IVDs) of Flnb–/–mice undergo rapid progressive degeneration during postnatal development and result in abnormal cell fate changes in the IVD, particularly in the annulus fibrosus (AF). Furthermore, AF cells lose typical fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire a molecular phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes. This change is characterized by hallmarks of endochondral-like ossification including alterations in collagen matrix, expression of Collagen X, increased apoptosis, and inappropriate ossifying of disc tissue. Our findings indicate that FLNB is involved in attenuation of TGFβ/BMP signaling and sustained activation of canonical noncanonical target genes p21 and Ctgf."

Furthermore their genomes encode functions not supposed to be in a virus, such as components of the protein translation apparatus. Since Lwoff in 1957, viruses are defined as ultimate obligate intracellular parasites from their need to hijack the peptide synthesis machinery of their host to replicate. We looked at the Mimivirus and Megavirus proteins that recognize the stop codons, the translation termination factors. We found that these genes contain two internal stop codons, meaning that their translation bypasses two distinct stop codons to produce a functional translation termination factor. These types of autoregulatory mechanisms are found in bacterial termination factors, although it involves only a single internal stop codon and not two, and are absent from their eukaryotic and archaeal homologs. Despite these bacterial-like features, giant viruses' termination factors have sequences that do not resemble bacterial genes but are clearly related to the eukaryotic and archaeal termination factors. Thus, giant viruses' termination factors surprisingly combine elements from eukaryotes/archaea and bacteria.","Mimivirus Megavirus is one of the most important representatives of the expanding new family of giant viruses infecting the Acanthamoeba. Despite its distinctive features, megabase-sized genomes carried particles of size comparable to small bacteria, fill the gap between the viral and cellular worlds. The presence of genes, thought hallmarks of cellular organisms, revived fundamental interrogations of the evolutionary origin of viruses and their link to the emergence of eukaryotes. In this work, we focused on the Mimivirus-encoded translation termination factor gene, which has a detailed primary structure and is elucidated by computational and experimental approaches. We demonstrated that the translation protein proceeds from internal stop codons to distinct recoding events: frameshift and readthrough, combined with the occurrence of unique viruses. Unexpectedly, the viral gene carries an autoregulatory mechanism exclusively encountered by bacterial termination factors, whereas the viral sequence is not related to any of the other bacterial termination factor genes. This finding provides a hint that virally encoded translation functions are strictly redundant provided to the host. Lastly, a perplexing occurrence of a bacterial-like regulatory mechanism and an ekaryotic/archaeal homologous gene oddity brought to the study of the giant viruses."

To better understand how age impacts behavior, we have assessed more than 3,400 people aged 4 to 91 years old. Each participant performed a series of online tasks that assessed their ability to behave randomly. The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would “look random to somebody else,” guessing which card would appear when selected from a randomly shuffled deck, and listing the hypothetical results of 10 rolls of a die. We analyzed the participants’ choices according to their algorithmic randomness, which is based on the idea that patterns that are more random are harder to encode in a short computer program. After controlling for characteristics such as gender, language, and education. We have found that age was the only factor that affected the ability to behave randomly. This ability peaked at age 25, on average, and declined from then on. We also demonstrate that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior. A similar approach could be then used to study potential connections between the ability to behave randomly, cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases and abilities such as human creativity.","Random Item Generation tasks (RIGs) are commonly used to assess high cognitive abilities, such as inhibition and sustained attention. However, little is known about the developmental curve of cognitive complexity in RIGs.

The main finding is that the evolutionary curve estimated by algorithmic complexity responses is similar to the expected measure of higher cognitive abilities. The performance peak at 25 decline starting at 60, suggesting that RIG-based tasks yield good estimates of cognitive abilities in the future. Our study illustrates short strings, i.e., 10 items, sufficient complexity to reliably estimate cognitive abilities and allow documentation of age-dependent decline."

Action potential propagation recruits tissue for contraction over short distances, but a single action potential sweeping through the uterus cannot explain organ-level function. Multiple action potentials seem to arise simultaneously, and apparently spontaneously, in different “regions” of the uterine wall. We interpret the existence of regions as a consequence of there being a maximum distance a single action potential can travel. To explain the synchronization of regional contractions, we use a second mechanism: initiation of contractions by stretch. Because the uterus is pressurized, contraction of the first region raises the intrauterine pressure slightly, which stretches the entire uterine wall. The stretch recruits another regional contraction, which generates more pressure. This positive feed-back recruits most regions into simultaneous activity. With this mechanism we simulate the contraction patterns of human labor, and show how contractions emerge from complex interactions. We explain why the decades-long search for the uterine pacemaker has failed, and why drugs that stimulate or inhibit tissue contractions have enigmatic effects at the organ-level. This simulation, for the first time, successfully links tissue experiments to clinical obstetrics.","The mechanisms that coordinate uterine contractions are not well understood. We develop a new model based on the proposal that the maximum distance of action potentials propagate through the uterine wall is the maximum. This model establishes “regions”, where action potential burst rapidly recruit tissue. Regions are recruited to the organ-level contraction by a stretch- initiated contraction mechanism (myometrial myogenic response). The uterine contraction begins with regional contraction, which slightly increases intrauterine pressure. Higher pressure raises tension in the uterus wall, and initiates contractions in regions that increase pressure. This positive feedback synchronizes the regional contractions with organ-levels contraction. Cellular automaton (Computational automaton) simulations are performed in Mathematica. The “cell” region is assigned the action potential threshold. The anatomy sensitivity factor converts intrauterines pressure to regional tension. The dynamics of the contraction occur when regional tension exceeds the regional threshold. We propose a new classification system for biological CAs that parallels the 4-class system of Wolfram."

We investigated the three-dimensional organization of the complex endomembrane system in the planctomycete bacterium Gemmata obscuriglobus. We reveal that the G. obscuriglobus cells are neither compartmentalized nor nucleated, contrary to previous claims, as none of the spaces created by the membrane invaginations is topologically closed; instead, they are all interconnected. The organization of cellular space is similar to that of a classical Gram-negative bacterium modified by the presence of large invaginations of the inner membrane inside the cytoplasm. Thus, the membrane organization of G. obscuriglobus, and most likely all PVC members, is not fundamentally different from, but is rather an extension of, the “classical” Gram-negative bacterial membrane system.","Plantomycetes, Verrucomicrobiae, Chlamydiae, and other bacterial superphylum, are the most common members of the Gram-negative bacterial membrane system.

Th2 cells are commonly associated with allergies, asthma and helminth infections. A common helminth infection that infects over 120 million people worldwide is lymphatic filarial infection caused by filarial parasites. We show here data that filarial infection is associated with the expansion of two types of Th2 cells, one which produces IL-4 and IL-13 alone without IL-5 and the other which produces all three cytokines. Interestingly, while the former subset is associated with the levels of antibodies - IgG4 and IgE; the latter is associated with the presence of eosinophilia in filarial infected individuals. In addition, these subsets appear to be modulated differently by the immunoregulatory cytokines - IL-10 and TGFβ. Therefore, our study highlights a novel regulation of Th2 cells and suggests that the Th2 compartment is quite heterogeneous in phenotype with possible functional consequences.","Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a chronic, tissue invasive parasitic infection that is characterized by a wide range of immune responses.

Finally, blockade of IL-10 and/or TGFβ demonstrated that these 2 regulatory cytokines exert opposite effects on different Th2 subsets.

During a viral infection, important pattern recognition receptors include the endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and a second set of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors known as the RNA helicases. Many studies have highlighted the importance of TLR3, TLR7/8 and the RNA helicases in providing robust anti-viral immunity via interferon induction and inflammation. Both endosomal TLR and cytoplasmic RNA helicase mediated pathways are believed to exist as separate yet non-redundant entities; however, little thought is given to why both systems exist, and few studies also consider how both pathways together contribute to anti-viral immunity. Using models of rhinovirus infection in primary bronchial epithelial cell culture in vitro and experimental infection in mouse and human models in vivo, we show that the RNA helicases are preferentially induced early in the infection cycle via TLR3 mediated signaling events, and work in a co-ordinated, systematic manner. The results help understand the complex events that determine effective innate immunity to rhinovirus infection and how these processes contribute to virus induced exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Rig-MDA5 is an intracellular RNA helicase that is expressed in primary bronchial epithelial cells.

In contrast, in vitro and in vivo, we found that the expression of TLRs3 and TRIF in vivo was increased at day 4 post infection. These findings suggest that the recognition of receptor by the receptor is co-ordinated with the induction of the intracelellular RNAs. Furthermore, IFNAR1 deficient mice exhibited increased levels of RV1B infection in an interferon independent manner. These results suggest that anti-viral defense of the bronchia epithelium requires co-conordinated recognition of receptors by the receptors."

Neurofilaments are cargoes of intracellular transport that move along microtubule tracks, and they accumulate abnormally in axons in many neurotoxic and neurodegenerative disorders. Intriguingly, it has been reported that neurofilaments and microtubules, which are normally interspersed in axonal cross-sections, often segregate apart from each other in these disorders, which is something that is never observed in healthy axons. Here we describe a stochastic multiscale computational model that explains the mechanism of this striking segregation and offers insights into the mechanism of neurofilament accumulation in disease.","The axon, a long thin projection of the neuron, is a key determinant of normal function of the axon. Under normal conditions, the axonal cytoskeletal polymers, microtubules and neurofilaments, align longitudinally to axons interspersed with axonal cross-sections. However, in neurotoxic neurodegenerative disorders, the microtubule-neurofilaments segregate apart, with microtubul membranous organelles clustered centrally in the axons and displaced to the periphery. This striking segregation precedes abnormal excessive neurofilament accumulation in diseases, which in turn leads to focal axonal swellings. Neurofilaments accumulation suggests that the underlying mechanism of segregation is poorly understood. To address this question, we developed a stochastic multiscale model of the cross-sectional distribution of microtubular and neurofilmaments in axons. Our model describes the dynamics of the transport of neurotubules to and from axons over time scales of seconds. The model incorporates longitudinal transport of the neurofilades into the organelle domain allowing stochastically the arrival and departure of cargoes from microtubuli mediated by molecular motors. Simulations of the model demonstrate that in the absence of neurofilmament transport, the mechanism gradually segregates microtubula and neurofilaraments at a time scale of hours, similar to those observed in toxic neuropathies. This model generates experimentally testable prediction of the rate of extent of segregation dependent on the sizes of the moving organelle and density of traffic."

We previously observed cells in microfluidic channels and studied their polarization and motility in a simplified (nearly 1 dimensional) geometry. There, precise gradients of chemically-inducible molecular probes were presented to elicit gradients of active Rac, independent of the upstream signaling. Here we develop a set of spatio-temporal mathematical models to account for the observed polarization behaviour of those cells, and their threshold response to induced Rac activity. These reaction-diffusion models for the interactions of signaling proteins (GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42) and membrane lipids (phosphoinositides PIP, , ) are analyzed by a new method (‘Local Perturbation Analysis’) that explores the effect that pulses of stimuli have on local (global) variables, i.e. those intermediates that have slow (fast) rates of diffusion. Together, the models and experiments suggest that (1) spatially uniform stimulation makes the cells more sensitive to applied gradients. (2) Feedback between phosphoinositides and Rho GTPases sensitizes a cell. (3) Cell lengthening/flattening accompanying polarization can increase the sensitivity of a cell and stabilize an otherwise unstable polarization.","The small GTPase Rac is an important regulator of cell polarization, cytoskeletal reorganization, motility, and motility in mammalian cells. In recent microfluidic experiments, HeLa cells were endowed with appropriate constructs and subjected to gradients of small molecule rapamycin leading to the synthetic membrane recruitment of Rac activator and direct graded activation of membrane-associated Rac. Rac activation was triggered by independent upstream signaling mechanisms responsible for transducing activating gradient signals. The response of cells to stimulation depended on exceeding the threshold of activated Rac. We develop a minimal reaction-diffusion model of the GTPases network and the interaction between Rac and phosphoinositide crosstalk consistent with experimental observations of polarization in cells. Our modeling suggests that mutual inhibition of Rac activation is likely to be the mode for cell polarization and that positive feedback from Rac activation may stabilize unstable polarization. We use a new analytical tool, Local Perturbation Analysis, to approximate partial differential equations of ordinary differential equations and local global variables. Our method helps to analyze parameter space and behaviour of proposed models. Our experiments suggest that spatially uniform stimulation serves to sensitize cell to applied gradients."

In this article, we describe a biologically motivated discrete stochastic model that shows that the patterns of spots and stripes of tightly packed cells observed in cultures derived from the embryonic vertebrate limb can occur by a mechanism that uses only cell–cell signaling via diffusible molecules (morphogens) and cell substratum adhesion (haptotaxis). Moreover, similar-looking patterns can arise both from stable stationary dynamics and unstable transient dynamics of the same underlying core molecular–genetic mechanism. Simulations also show that spot and stripe patterns (which also correspond to the nodules and bars of the developing limb skeleton in vivo) are close in parameter space and can be generated in multiple ways with single-parameter variations. An important implication is that some developmental processes do not require a strict progression from one stable dynamic regime to another, but can occur by a succession of transient dynamic regimes tuned (e.g., by natural selection) to achieve a particular morphological outcome.","The development of the limb is a complex process that involves the formation of “cell condensations” that are tightly packed at the sites of cartilage.

To find genetic factors that may be involved, we used GAP1 mRNA as a marker of this post-transcriptional regulation and developed a method for estimating mRNA abundance using a combination of mRNA FISH, FACS, and Barcode sequencing. We identified the Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex as having large differences in GAP1 mRNA regulation, and further work identified that the decapping modulators EDC3 and SCD6, the translation initiation factor eIF4G2, and the 5’ UTR of GAP1 have defects in rapidly clearing GAP1 mRNA during this transition. Our study suggests that changes in the translational status of specific mRNAs may impact their stability in response to environmental signals.","Cellular responses to changing environments frequently involve rapid reprogramming of the transcriptome. Regulated changes in mRNA degradation rates accelerate reprogrammed and clearing of extant transcripts. Here, we measured the mRNA stability of 4-thiouracil labeling of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found 78 mRNAs subject to destabilization. These transcripts include Nitrogen Catabolite Repression (NCR) and carbon metabolism mRNAAs, suggesting that the mRNA destabilization mechanism is targeted by the reprogrammer transcriptome in response to changes in the environment. We used a SortSeq approach to screen a pooled collection of library of trans factors that mediate rapid GAP1 mRNA repression. We combined low-input multiplexed Barcode sequencing with branched-DNA single-molecule mRNA FISH Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BFF) to identify the Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex as a general mRNA decay machinery. We find that decapping modulators of EDC3 SCD6, translation factor eIF4G2, and 5’ UTRGAP1 factors mediate the rapid repression of GAP 1 mRNA, suggesting translational control of the post-transcriptional fate of mRNA as response to environmental changes."

Although believed to be endemic in the Philippines, little is known of the epidemiology and geographic distribution of this disease in the country. We reviewed data from clinical studies, prevalence surveys and animal studies since the 1950s. Based on this review, JEV is an important cause of encephalitis and febrile illness in all three major island groups of the country. The majority of cases were seen in children younger than 15 years and males were more often affected than females. The national laboratory initiated testing of referred cases in 2009 and surveillance for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with laboratory confirmation of a subset of cases was established in 2011. From 2011 to 2014, there were 1,032 cases of suspected JE. Of 497 cases with specimens tested, 73 (15%) had laboratory-confirmed JE.

KS is particularly prevalent amongst HIV-positive populations in Africa and is a major health concern. Virus productive replication, in addition to latency, is important for maintaining viral load within the host and also for KS pathogenesis. Essential to HHV-8 and other virus replication is the control of innate host defenses, which comprise stress-sensing cellular signaling pathways that result ultimately in programmed cell death (apoptosis). Here we identify a novel mechanism whereby a viral protein, viral interferon regulatory factor-1 (vIRF-1), mediates inhibition of a stress sensor and initiator of apoptosis, Bim, by inducing its translocation to the cell nucleus and thereby sequestration away from the cytoplasmic compartment where it exerts its pro-death activity. We show that vIRF-1:Bim interaction is necessary for efficient HHV-8 productive replication and that it can be blocked using a cell-permeable antagonist of vIRF-1:Bim binding. Our data not only identify previously unsuspected mechanisms of Bim inactivation and vIRF-1 function, but suggest that inhibitory targeting of vIRF-1 interaction with Bim may be of therapeutic benefit.","Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) uses a variety of strategies to block host innate antiviral defenses by interference with interferon and apoptotic signaling.

It is well known that robust activation of innate immunity is essential to achieve an efficient vaccine response, and that poxviruses have developed numerous strategies to block the innate immune response. Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying innate immune sensing of MVA are poorly characterized. Toll-like receptors (TLR), RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) and NOD-like receptors (NLR) are families of membrane-bound and cytosolic sensors that detect the presence of microbial products and initiate host innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, we report the first comprehensive study of MVA sensing by innate immune cells, demonstrating that TLR2-TLR6-MyD88, MDA-5-IPS-1 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways play specific and coordinated roles in regulating cytokine, chemokine and interferon response to MVA poxvirus infection. Delineation of the pathways involved in the sensing of MVA by the host could help designing modified vectors with increased immunogenicity, which would be of particular importance since MVA is considered as a leading vaccine for HIV/AIDS vaccine following the recent failure of an adenovirus-mediated HIV vaccine trial.","Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated double-stranded DNA poxvirus currently developed as a vaccine vector for HIV/AIDS.

Most notably, more than 80% of colon cancers arise from aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway. A better understanding of how Wnt signaling functions in the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) during homeostasis and in disease states is thus critical. The Drosophila digestive tract provides a powerful genetic model and an entry point to study these questions. Here, we find that the Wg ligand and pathway activation are enriched at Drosophila intestinal compartment boundaries and are essential for development and homeostasis of the adult gut. During homeostasis, Wg signaling in enterocytes is required to prevent the overproliferation of ISCs non-autonomously. In addition, during development, Wg signaling ensures proper cell fate specification near compartment boundaries. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the Wg-dependent regulation of adult intestinal function.","Intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal is directed by Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammals, but aberrant Wnt pathway activation in ISCs triggers development of human colorectal carcinoma. Here, we use Drosophila midgut, a powerful model of ISC regulation, to elucidate the mechanisms by which Wingless (Wg)/Wnt regulates intestinal homeostasis during development. We show that Wg signaling is essential for ISC proliferation in the adult intestine, and that activation peaks at major compartment boundaries in adult intestine. Wg pathway activation peaks in the intestinal epithelium, and is required to specify cell fate near compartment boundaries during development, and to control ISC growth in compartments of homeostatic development. In contrast to the previous focus on Wg/Wnt signaling, we demonstrate that the primary mechanism by which Wg and Wnt regulate ISC cell proliferation is non-autonomous. Activation of Wg by absorptive enterocytes is required for suppress JAK-STAT signaling in neighboring ISCs, but not proliferation. Thus, we conclude that Wingless signaling gradients play essential roles in ISC development and in the development of adult intestinal cells."

Furthermore , laminin novel critical molecular cue mediating fiber orientation limiting muscle cell length .","Despite the importance of muscle fiber development and tendon attachment, this process is incompletely understood in vertebrates. One critical step is muscle fiber elongation; muscle precursor cells are short and subsequent elongation/fusion generates long, multinucleate muscle fibers. Using a vertebrate model organism, the zebrafish, we find that single round myoblasts elongate to span the entire width of the myotome prior to fusion. Using rigorous and objective mathematical characterization techniques, we can further divide muscle development into three stages: short precursor cells, intercalation/elongation, and boundary capture/myotube formation. The second phase, elongation, occurs via a two-step mechanism of protrusion extension and filling. Myotube formation involves boundary capture, where the ends of muscle fibers anchor themselves to the myotome boundary and stop elongating. We show that the protein laminin is required for boundary capture, normal fiber length, and proper fiber orientation. Genetic mosaic experiments in laminin-deficient embryos reveal that boundary capture is a cell autonomous phenomenon. Wild-type (normal) cells capture the boundary appropriately and stop elongating in laminin-deficient embryos. Although adhesion to laminin has been implicated in muscular dystrophies where the attachment between muscle cells and tendons fails, no early developmental requirements for laminin in fast muscle morphogenesis have been shown until now.","Skeletal muscle morphogenesis transforms short muscle precursor cells into long, multinucleate myotubes that anchor tendons at the myotendinous junction (MTJ). In vertebrates, a great deal is known about the muscle specification of somitic cells, but the molecular factors that limit elongation are unknown. In zebrafish, fast muscle fiber morphogenesis consists of three discrete phases: short precursor cells, intercalation/extensionation, and boundary capture/myotube formation. During the first phase, cells exhibit randomly directed protrusive activity, followed by a three-step process: protrusion extension filling and elongation. The repetition of protrusion and extension filling continues until the anterior posterior ends of the muscle fiber reach MTJ. Finally, the ends of muscle fiber anchor MTJ undergo morphogenetic changes that adopt a stereotypical, cylindrical shape. We find that the basement membrane protein laminin is required for efficient elongation, proper fiber orientation, boundary capture, and myotub formation. Lamininα2 mutant embryos exhibit early muscle defects in contrast to later dystrophic phenotypes. Surprisingly, our genetic mosaic analysis suggests that boundary capture is a cell-autonomous phenomenon. Taken together, our results define two distinct phases in muscle fiber morphology that are critical for the second phase elongation and the repetitive process of protrusive extension and protrusion filling."

There is a striking lack of information on the blood-feeding rates of Triatominae in field conditions, and factors modifying the fraction of bugs that feed on humans have rarely been investigated. Here we tested whether the spring fraction of bugs' feeding contacts with humans would decrease when dogs and chickens are available in human sleeping quarters in a well-defined endemic rural area in northwestern Argentina. On average, late-stage bugs fed every four days in spring and the majority fed on humans. The results demonstrate that both the percentage of human-fed bugs and the daily rate of feeding on humans decreased substantially with increasing proportions of chicken- or dog-fed bugs in the house, or the presence of chickens indoors. Combined with earlier findings on the seasonal dynamics of bug abundance, host-feeding patterns and the relative infectivity of domestic hosts, the net effects of the presence of chickens and dogs in human sleeping quarters is predicted to increase the transmission of T. cruzi in summer when chickens move outdoors.","Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Triatoma infestans.

On the other hand, in patients suffering from innate or acquired immune deficiencies, CMV can cause severe disease or death. Infection of mice with the mouse CMV (MCMV) is an experimental model to study the biology of CMV infection, and mice that lack all of their lymphocytes are very susceptible to MCMV and die typically within three weeks of infection. In this article we show that MCMV causes disease and death in mice lacking lymphocytes because its gene M36 blocks programmed cell death, or apoptosis. MCMV lacking the M36 gene grew thousand folds less well in these mice, which significantly improved survival. This was because M36 deletion made MCMV susceptible to the action of macrophages, cells that secrete soluble factors that induce apoptosis. Importantly, viral growth and virulence of the M36-deficient MCMV could be restored by blocking apoptosis by other means, showing that the block of apoptosis was critical for viral replication. Therefore, our data imply that viral inhibition of apoptosis may be a key molecular target for antiviral strategies in immunodeficient hosts.","The murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) gene M36 is a functional homologue of the human cytomegalycirus gene UL36, which encodes an inhibitor of apoptosis that binds to caspase-8, blocks downstream signaling and contributes to viral fitness in macrophages in vivo. The direct link between the inability of mutants lacking the M36 gene (ΔM36) to inhibit apoptosis, poor viral growth in the macrophage cell cultures, and poor viral in vivo fitness and virulence is consistent with a defect in the immune evasion mechanism that protects MCMV selectively from antiviral activity. Our data suggest that a time-evasion mechanism protects the virus selectively against antiviral molecules secreted by the immune system, which critically contributes viral pathogenicity in immunocompromised host devoid of an adaptive immune system."

It is thus vitally important to reconstruct protein-protein interactions (PPIs) before we can fully understand biological processes. However, critical difficulties exist. Particularly the rate of wrongly predicting PPIs to be true (false positive rate) is extremely high in PPIs prediction. The traditional approaches of error correction from each generating source can be both time-consuming and inefficient. We propose a method that can substantially reduce false positive rates by emphasizing information from more reliable data sources, and de-emphasizing less reliable sources. We indicate that it is indeed the case from our extensive studies. Our predictions also suggest that large numbers of not only false positives but also false negatives may exist in previous studies, as validated by two human PPIs datasets having high quality. The ability to predict large numbers of PPIs both reliably and automatically may inspire people to use computational approaches to correct data errors in general, and speed up PPIs prediction with high quality. Reliable prediction from our method may benefit other studies involving such as protein function prediction and roles of PPIs in disease susceptibility.","Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for fundamental cellular processes.

A special class of promoters, known as bidirectional promoters, regulates expression of two genes instead of one. These promoters are situated between two adjacent genes whose transcription start sites are physically within 1,000 bp and oriented in opposite directions. Bidirectional promoters are found repeatedly in the genome, suggesting an important biological significance for this regulatory configuration. We developed an algorithm to map bidirectional promoters using data from a comprehensive list of transcribed sequences known as expressed sequence tags, or ESTs. This approach improved the number of previously characterized bidirectional promoters by 300%. Included in the new data are bidirectional promoters that regulate expression of genes implicated in somatic cancers. For instance, ten well-recognized genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers were identified as having bidirectional promoters. Three of the genes are further related by having duplicate copies of the same binding site for a transcription factor within their bidirectional promoters. These binding sites are conserved among species, providing greater evidence that they are functionally important. This example, in which similar regulatory structures are used to control genes involved in cancer, illustrates how data can be mined from the comprehensive set of bidirectional promoters. Within this manuscript, we show statistical evidence that many cancer genes are regulated by bidirectional promoters. These promoters will be a valuable dataset for studying the role of gene regulation in tumor development.","The “bidirectional gene pair” comprises adjacent genes at transcription start sites that are directed away from each other. The intervening regulatory region is called a “bidirectional promoter.” These promoters are associated with genes that function in DNA repair, and are potential to participate in the development of cancer. The connection between gene pairs and cancer has not been previously investigated. In this study, we used spliced-expression sequence tags (ESTs) to identify the complete collection of human transcripts that control bidirectional promoters. We identified new genes that are regulated by these genes. These genes are implicated in somatic cancer, including a substantial number of genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers. We repeated use of promoter structure in the human genome suggests that these genes regulate co-expression patterns among groups of genes. We also verify regulatory networks of genes controlled by bidirectionally promoters. Subsets of promoters contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding site ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2. Interpreting the regulation of genes involved in co- expression networks, especially involved in cancer, is an important step in defining molecular events that contribute to disease."

Dysregulation of the HPA axis is associated with a number of neuroimmune disorders including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), depression, Gulf War illness (GWI), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective diagnosis and targeted treatments of these disorders have proven challenging because they present no obvious lesion. However, the body's various components do not work in isolation, and it is important to consider exactly how their interactions might be altered by disease. Using a relatively simple mathematical description of the HPA axis, we show how the complex dynamical behavior of this system will readily accommodate multiple stable resting states, some of which may correspond to chronic loss of function. We propose that a well-directed push given at the right moment may encourage the axis to reset under its own volition. We use model-based predictive control theory to compute such a push. The result is counterintuitive and challenges the conventional time-invariant approach to disease and therapy. Indeed we demonstrate that in some cases it might be possible to exploit the natural dynamics of these physiological systems to stimulate recovery.","The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a major system maintaining body homeostasis and regulating neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous systems modulating immune function. Recent work has shown that the complex dynamics of the HPA axis can accommodate stable steady states, which corresponds to the hypocortisol state observed in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). We present a model-based predictive control (MPC) methodology to estimate robust treatment courses that are displacing the normal and abnormal axis from the abnormal and stable steady state to a healthy cortisol level. Our approach is based on a recent model of HPA and its dynamics incorporating glucocorticoid receptor kinetics. The candidate treatment displays robust properties, but face significant biological variability and measurement uncertainty. We show that when the treatment is discontinued, cortisol levels naturally progress to a stable attractor defined by normal hormone levels. Suppression of biologically available cortisol is achieved by use of binding proteins to CBG and certain metabolizing enzymes, offering possible avenues for deployment in the clinical setting. Treatment strategies designed to maximally exploit system dynamics provide a robust response to treatment and ensure a positive outcome in a wide range of conditions."

However, even with high coverage, infection is seen following treatment. In four communities in Tanzania, we followed every child aged under ten years from baseline through treatment to six months post-treatment. We determined who had infection at baseline and who still had or developed infection six months later. Coverage was over 95% in children in these communities, and infection in these children decreased by over 50% at six months. The study found that, at baseline, uninfected children who were treated had prevalence of infection at 6 months of 6%, but infected children who were treated had prevalence of infection of 22% at 6 months. Other risk factors for infection at 6 months included living in a household with other infected children, and living in a household with untreated children. Our data suggest that households with untreated children might be targeted for more intensive follow up to increase coverage and reduce subsequent infection in the community.","Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness in the world, and endemic communities, mass treatment with azithromycin reduces the pool of infection. High coverage is essential, especially for children with an infectious reservoir. However, infection remains post-mass treatment. We sought to determine the risk factors for infection in children with trachoma in 4 villages in Tanzania. We enrolled 1,991 children between 9 years and 4 years of age in a longitudinal study using individual household characteristics collected at baseline. Infection was determined by an ocular exam and infection was detected by a PCR eyelid swab. Azthromycin was offered to the infected children at 6 months, despite the 95% coverage. Baseline infection was 23.7% and 6 months 10.4%, despite 95% of coverage. We found that infection at baseline was positively associated with infection 6 months ( = 3.31, 95%CI 2.40–4.56) and treatment had a protective effect. The age group 2–4 years increased the risk of infection at the 6 months. The household characteristics were predictive of infection in 6 months by increasing the number of children infected at the household baseline and by an increasing number of untreated children in the household. The round of mass treatment, with high coverage and a decrease in infection 50%, appears sufficient to eliminate infection. Our findings suggest that households with increasing numbers of infected and untreated children may be targeted for intensive follow-up."

It is also highly adaptable to different environmental stimuli, e.g. regular exercise. Exercise training improves overall health and muscle function, and can be used to prevent and treat several common diseases e.g. cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanisms behind adaptation processes in human skeletal muscle. In this study, we show that different expression variants from the same gene can be regulated in different directions with training, implicating alternative protein functions from one single gene. Such findings are emblematic of the complex mechanisms regulating the effects of training. We also find that training changes the activity of functionally unknown parts of the genome, with the potential for new proteins involved in the health-enhancing effects of exercise. Additionally, our results challenge the belief of a skeletal muscle memory, where previous training can affect the response to a subsequent training period. Overall, we provide understanding of the skeletal muscle biology and novel insights into the mechanisms behind the massive benefits of regular exercise on the human skeletal muscle transcriptome, inspiring further studies for deeper investigation.","Exercise training is an important health benefit for skeletal muscle function, and it can prevent many common diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes and obesity. However, the molecular adaptation mechanisms regulating these effects are incompletely understood. To date, global transcriptome changes in skeletal muscles have not been studied at the gene level. In this study, we studied the effects of repeated interventions on the transcriptional and memory training response. We found that training altered expression of 3,404 gene isoforms, mainly associated with oxidative ATP production and protein-coding potential. Training also altered the expression of 34 novel transcripts, which had protein- coding potential. In the months of detraining, training-induced transcriptome differences were detected in previously trained and untrained legs. These differences were coherent evidence that endurance training induced transcriptional responses to repeated training, and coherent evidence for the human lifestyle intervention induced differential expression of thousands of isoforms in unannotated regions of the genome. These changes are likely to reflect adaptational mechanisms that provide functional health benefits of regular physical activity."

Blue light activates two cryptochrome photoreceptors which subsequently inactivate an E3 ubiquitin ligase consisting of COP1 and SPA proteins. While COP1 also exists in humans where it polyubiquitinates a number of proteins, e.g. p53, in a light-independent fashion, it is known that SPA proteins are specific to the green lineage. Here, we show that SPA proteins are required for the blue light-induced interaction between cryptochrome 1 and COP1. We thus provide mechanistic evidence that SPA proteins may have evolved in plants to place the activity of the COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase under the control of light.","Plants constantly adjust their growth, development and metabolism to the ambient light environment. Blue light is sensed by Arabidopsis photoreceptors CRY1 and CRY2, which subsequently initiate light signal transduction by repressing the COP1/SPA E3 ubiquitin ligase. However, the interaction of cryptochromes with SPA proteins is blue light-dependent. Here, we show that CRY 1 interacts with COP1 constitutively, i.e. darkness. In contrast, in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we suggest that the SPA protein SPA1 is required for the high-affinity interaction between CRY and COP1 in light-sensitive seedlings exposed to blue light. Our results suggest that SPA-binding is necessary for COP1-SPA1 interaction in blue light, implying that COP1 is also necessary for the interaction between COP1 and SPA."

A challenging problem in computational biology is the understanding of the domain–domain interaction mechanism. Here, we propose a new approach for the analysis and prediction of domain–domain binding sites. Our computational approach, which relies on the modular division of 3-D domain structures, identifies modular regions involved in binding and can complement previously introduced predictive methods. Further results illustrate that binding sites display a modular configuration. A detailed analysis of protein domains with available experimental binding data revealed that modules are energetically independent from each other, whereas residues within modules contribute cooperatively to the binding energy. The modular composition of binding surfaces may generate high binding affinity and specificity, and facilitate the appearance of new domain binding partners. This advantageous organization of protein structures has been conserved by evolution and may be used to design an effective drug strategy.","Proteins are the building blocks of proteins and play a crucial role in protein–protein interactions. In this study, we propose a new approach for prediction of domain–domain interfaces. Our method relies on the representation of domains in residue-interacting networks, and finds optimal decomposition of domain structures into modules. The resulting modules comprise highly cooperative residues, which exhibit connections between modules. We found that non-overlapping binding sites of a domain, involved in different domains–domain interactions, generally contained different modules. This observation indicates that modular decomposition is able to separate protein domains from regions with specialized functions. Furthermore, modules have high modularity values and identify binding site regions, demonstrating the predictive character of modularity. Moreover, the combination of these modularity characteristics, sequence conservation and surface patches, found to improve predictions. Our results support the idea that modules possess certain functional energetic independence."

Incorporation additional feedback circadian model produced results consistent previous experimental observations wild - type protein profiles numerous mutant phenotypes .","The ability of an organism to adapt to daily changes in the environment, via a circadian clock, is an inherently interesting phenomenon recently connected to several human health issues. Decades of experiments on one of the smallest model animals, the fruit fly Drosophila, has illustrated significant similarities with the mammal circadian system. Within Drosophila, the PERIOD and TIMELESS proteins are central to controlling this rhythmicity and were recently shown to have a rapid and stable association creating an “interval” timer in the cell's cytoplasm. This interval timer creates the necessary delay between the expression and activity of these genes, and is directly opposed to the previous hypothesis of a delay created by slow association. We use several mathematical models to investigate the unknown factors controlling this timer. Using a novel positive feedback loop, we construct a circadian model consistent with the interval timer and many wild-type and mutant experimental observations. Our results suggest several novel genes and interactions to be tested experimentally.","The Drosophila circadian clock is the most common time-lapse phenomenon observed in mammals. It is thought that the circadian clock acts as a “interval timer” in the cytoplasm, which is responsible for the timing of the clock. In this study, we present a detailed, mechanism-based mathematical framework for understanding the circadian rhythms. We show that this framework facilitates a systematic approach to understanding circadian rhythms and provides a comprehensive representation of the network underlying the phenomenon. The possible mechanisms underlying these mechanisms have been investigated, suggesting a novel positive feedback regulatory structure. Incorporation of an additional feedback circadian model produced results consistent with previous experimental observations of wild-type protein profiles and numerous mutant phenotypes."

In this study, we temporarily inactivated one of these areas in the monkey parietal cortex and measured the effect on the network of brain areas involved in three-dimensional shape processing using functional brain imaging. Surprisingly, reversible inactivation of a parietal area not only reduced the functional activations in other parietal areas, but also in distantly separate brain areas such as the inferotemporal cortex. Moreover, parietal inactivation also caused a significant perceptual deficit in a depth-structure discrimination task. Electrical microstimulation of the inactivation site revealed that almost all of the observed effects were indirect, i.e., arising through a different brain area. Thus, a combination of functional brain imaging, causal perturbation methods, and behavioral measurements in monkeys can elucidate the flow of three-dimensional object information in the primate brain.","The visual system consists of a ventral stream, specialized for object recognition, and a dorsal visual stream, crucial for spatial vision and actions. However, little is known about the interactions between these two flow streams.

Reversible inactivation of macaque caudal intraparietal area (CIP) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reduced fMRI activations in the posterior parietal cortex and dorsal stream, surprisingly, in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC) and the ventral visual stream.

A minimum variance model would predict that the motor system plans movements that minimize motor error (as measured by the variance in movement) subject to the constraint that the movement be completed within a specified time limit. A complementary model would predict that the motor system minimizes movement time subject to the constraint that movement variance not exceed a certain fixed threshold. But neither of these models is adequate to predict performance in everyday tasks that include external costs imposed by the environment where good performance requires that the motor system select a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. In driving to the airport to catch a plane, for example, there are very real costs associated with driving too fast and also with being just a bit too late. But the “optimal” tradeoff depends on road conditions and also on how important it is to catch the plane. We examine motor performance in analogous experimental tasks where we impose arbitrary monetary costs on movements that are “late” or “early” and show that humans systematically trade off risk and reward so as to maximize their expected monetary gain.","Motor control requires the generation of precise temporal sequence of control signals sent to the skeletal musculature. In this study, we describe an experiment that requires human subjects to plan movements taking into account uncertainty of movement duration and increase uncertainty of increasing movement duration. We found that subjects compensated for the natural duration-dependent temporal uncertainty by compensating for the overall increase in temporal uncertainty imposed experimentally. The compensation of temporal uncertainty, natural duration and dependent imposed by overall components, was a nearly optimal sense for maximizing the expected gain of the task. Our results indicate that the motor system is able to model temporal uncertainty to compensate for uncertainty and optimize the consequences of movement."

Essentially only the O1 serogroup of Vibrio cholerae causes epidemic cholera. This serogroup has two immunologically distinguishable serotype variants called Ogawa and Inaba. The Inaba serotype is a consequence of a mutation in a single gene, wbeT, that in its intact form encodes for an enzyme that methylates the terminal perosamine sugar of the lipopolysaccharide side chain thus resulting in the Ogawa serotype. By careful examination over a five-year period of the genetic lineages of bacteria causing cholera in an endemic area we show data indicating that serotype switching is not a random process but is driven by selection pressures that have yet to be identified.","Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera in India. In this study, we used serotype switching data from clinical Vibrio Cholerae O1 isolates collected over a two year period in Kolkata, India. We found that the switch in Ogawa Inaba resulted in a mutational disruption of the methyltransferase encoded by the wbeT gene. The re-emergence of the Ogawa serotype was found to result from an expansion of the existing Ogawa clade and a reversion of the mutation in the Inaba clade.

Another secreted coagulase, designated von-Willebrand factor binding protein (vWbp), catalyzes a similar reaction. Staphylococcal binding to fibrinogen or fibrin is an important attribute of disease pathogenesis, which leads to the formation of abscesses and bacterial persistence in host tissues. We report here that Coa and vWbp are essential for S. aureus strain Newman abscess formation and persistence in host tissues. Antibodies directed against Coa or vWbp prevent coagulase binding to prothrombin or fibrinogen and confer protection against challenge with S. aureus Newman or the methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolate USA300 LAC in mouse models of abscess formation or lethal sepsis.

The disease is generally restricted to those living in low-income settings with poor sanitation. Typhoid fever is a common cause of fever requiring hospital treatment in Cambodia, but limited data is available on the epidemiology of the disease. To better understand typhoid fever in Cambodia, we accessed routine hospital data for typhoid fever from a single healthcare facility treating sick children in Siem Reap in the central Cambodia between 2007 and 2014. We mapped the location of these cases and examined population-based risk factors for reported disease. Additionally, we decoded the genomes of the S. Typhi isolated from children attending the hospital to understand how the organism has evolved and spread throughout the population. We found a large burden of typhoid fever in children in this largely rural setting in central Cambodia. We also found that disease was associated with the rainy season and that living close to Tonle Sap Lake increased the risk of disease. The genomes of the sequenced bacteria showed that a diverse range of strains were circulating during the study, and allowed us to identify signatures of location- and time-specific outbreaks. Our work provides baseline data for additional typhoid fever studies in the population living in this location and findings suggest that rural Cambodia would be a suitable setting in which to introduce a school-based vaccination program with new typhoid vaccines.","Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, is an endemic cause of febrile disease in Cambodia. The aim of this study was to better understand the epidemiology of pediatric typhoid fever in rural Cambodia.

The study period, 262 cases of typhoid were reported within a 100 km radius of the AHC, with a median patient age of 8.2 years (IQR: 5.1–11.5 years). The majority of infections occurred during the rainy season, and commune incidences were high at 11.36/1,000 children aged <15 years observed during the study period.

Spatial mapping of WGS provided additional resolution findings, confirmed that proximity to the lake was associated with a discrete spatiologic disease cluster. We also confirmed the dominance of the MDR H58 and H58 sublineages in S. typhi population, and found substantial evidence of diversification (seven sublinesages) in a single lineage. These data provide a platform for additional population-driven typhoid disease studies in Cambodia, and suggest a suitable setting to introduce a school-based vaccination programme with Vi conjugate vaccines."

No vaccines or antivirals for Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease are available at this time. We developed an experimental vaccine using inactivated, purified EV71 with an adjuvant to amplify the immune response. When this vaccine was tested in mice and rabbits, they produced large amounts of antibodies that could neutralize the virus. We were reasonably certain that the vaccine would be safe because rabbits given repeated high doses did not develop pathological lesions or clinical symptoms. Based on these results, we proceeded to test the safety of the vaccine in human adults.","Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) and neurological complications, particularly in young children in the Asia-Pacific region. There are no vaccines or antiviral therapies currently available for the prevention and treatment of HFMD caused by EV71. Therefore, development of therapeutic preventive strategies for HFMD is of growing importance. In this report, we report the immunogenic and safety profile of inactivated, purified EV71 preparations formulated with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant preclinical studies in mice and rabbits. In mice, candidate vaccine formulations elicited high neutralizing antibody responses. The toxicology study of vaccine formulations planned for human use performed in rabbits showed that vaccine-related pathological changes in animals remained healthy.

Here, we have developed a novel entry/uncoating assay based on the degree of exposure of a virion-packaged mRNA reporter to the translation machinery (EURT). Using this assay, we highlight here that at least two measurable kinds of viral capsids coexist during HIV-1 infection: one defined as open, in which the viral genome is readily accessible to translation and another that we define as closed, in which access to the genome is prevented until the artificial destabilization of capsids. Our data points to the former as dead-end products of infection and indicate the latter as the commonly referred infectious viral cores. Interestingly, we show here that despite the fact that reverse transcription reshapes viral cores, these structures maintain an exquisite ability to shield the viral genome from the cytoplasmic environment. Finally, IFNα that negatively impacts HIV-1 replication increases the proportion of open viral cores to the detriment of closed ones, suggesting a core-destabilizing activity driven by interferon-regulated proteins. Overall, this assay sheds new light on the behavior of viral cores inside target cells.","HIV-1 capsids are the most abundant viral species in the world, and their genome is readily exposed to the cytoplasm. In order to study the behavior of these capsids, we developed an entry/uncoating assay based on core-packaged RNA availability Translation. The EURT alternative Blam-Vpr, a reporter of RNA translation, relies on core opening to study viral capsids behavior. Our study reveals the existence of a major capsid species, the dead end of the viral genome, which can readily be readily exposed and exposed to functional exposure requires artificial core destabilization. Reverse transcription drives a faster loss of susceptibility to viral cores at high doses of PF74, which lead to higher exposure to viral genome. Furthermore, IFNα drifts the cores of functional and non-functional species, revealing a novel core-destabilizing activity. Our assay sheds new light on the behavior and behavior of viral cores inside target cells."

Protective function associated cell type specific regional restriction viral replication grey matter ameliorated neurodegeneration demyelination .","Initial spread of viruses is controlled by type I interferon induced antiviral molecules. Early intervention with viral replication is especially critical in central nervous system infections to reduce loss of non-renewable cells and mitigate immune pathology. One of the best characterized anti-viral mechanisms is mediated by ribonuclease L (RNase L). RNase L exerts activity at multiple levels, including degradation of viral and host RNA, induction of apoptosis, and propagation of the IFN-α/β pathway. Recent studies suggest that RNase L antiviral activity is dependent on the virus, as well as the cell type and tissue infected. This study demonstrates that RNase L protects mice infected with a sub-lethal, demyelinating neurotropic coronavirus by ameliorating encephalitis and morbidity, albeit without affecting control of infectious virus or IFN-α/β expression. RNase L specifically protected the brain stem from sustained infection and prevented spread of virus to microglia/macrophages located in spinal cord grey matter. The subtle regional alteration in tropism in the absence of RNase L coincided with increased apoptotic cells and earlier onset as well as increased severity of axonal damage and demyelination. The results demonstrate how subtle regional alterations in viral tropism within the CNS may severely affect the balance between neuroprotection and neurotoxicity mediated by microglia/macrophages.","The innate anti-viral functions of the CNS are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of RNase L in viral encephalomyelitis in the CNS. We found that the virus was sub-lethal in mice infected with the hepatitis virus variant, and that the majority of infected mice succumbed to infection day 12 p.i. The virus was able to control the virus by restricting viral tropism and protecting them from neurotropic coronavirus infection. However, the mechanisms underlying the innate antiviral function of the virus were poorly understood, and our findings suggest that the viral infection is mediated by a cell type specific regional restriction of viral replication in grey matter."

Developing effective policies for mitigating zoonotic infections is often challenging, both because of the complexity of their spread and because very limited resources must be allocated among a range of control options. It is increasingly becoming clear that mathematical modeling, and in particular network modeling, of disease spread can aid in analyzing and mitigating these spreads. Here, we develop a network model for the spread and control of a zoonotic infection, focusing particularly on a case study of brucellosis transmission and control among wildlife, cattle herds, and human subpopulations in an agricultural community. After motivating and formulating the model, we introduce tools for 1) parameterization of the model from time-course and snapshot data, 2) simulation and analysis of the model, and 3) optimal design of control policies using the model. The study shows that the network model can inform design of heterogeneous control policies that mitigate zoonotic disease spread with limited resources.","Zoonotic diseases are the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world, and they are transmitted by animals and humans. In order to control these diseases, it is important to understand the spread dynamics of the disease and to design effective control policies. Mathematical models, particular network models, are promising tools for control-policy design, providing comprehensive quantitative representations of disease transmission and disease spread. In this study, a layered dynamical network model of transmission and control of zoonotic disease was introduced as a tool for analyzing disease spread and designing cost-effective surveillance control. The model development achieved by brucellosis transmission in wildlife, cattle herds, and human sub-populations in an agricultural system is a case study. Precisely, the model tracks infection counts of interacting animal herds and multiple species (e.g. cattle herds and groups of wildlife brucellcellosis) in human subpopulations introduced by the model. This model is abstracted and permits comprehensive targeted design of multiple control capabilities and model identification data. In addition, preliminary identification of the network model for brucellotic disease achieved in historical data, robustness and robustness was obtained. These results indicate that network modeling can aid designing control policies for the control and prevention of these diseases."

We noted that these parasites and humans express similar kinase enzymes. Since these similar human targets have been pursued by the drug industry for many years in the discovery of cellular growth and proliferation inhibitors, compounds developed as human anti-cancer agents should also have effect on inhibiting growth and proliferation of the parasites. With that in mind, we selected eight established PI3K and mTOR inhibitors for profiling against these pathogens. Among these inhibitors is an advanced clinical candidate against cancer, NVP-BEZ235, which we demonstrate to be a highly potent trypanocide in parasite cultures, and in a mouse model of T. brucei infection. Additionally, we describe observations of these inhibitors' effects on parasite growth and other cellular characteristics.","Trypanosomatids are the causative agents of African sleeping sickness, a parasitic disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, Leishmania major, and L. donovani.

We also show that the compound NVP-BEZ235 has sub-nanomolar potency, efficacy in cultured parasites, and ability to clear parasitemia in an animal model of parasite infection. These studies strongly suggest that mammalian PI3/TOR kinase inhibitors may be a productive starting point for anti-trypanosomal drug discovery."

In the laboratory, procyclic forms (the form that multiplies in the midgut), are routinely cultured at 27°C. When procyclic forms are heated to temperatures of 37°C and above, they decrease protein production, and at 41°C, mRNAs aggregate into granules. We show here that quite a large number of mRNAs are not included in granules and continue to be used for making proteins. Some of the proteins that continue to be made are needed in order to defend the cells against the effects of heat shock. Interestingly, however, a moderate heat shock stimulates expression of genes needed for the parasites to develop further into forms that can colonise the salivary glands. It thus seems possible that in the field, temperature variations might influence the efficiency with which of trypanosomes in tsetse flies become infective for mammals.","African trypanosome procyclic forms multiply in the midgut of tsetse flies, routinely cultured at 27°C. Heat shocks at 37°C result in general inhibition of translation, and severe heat shock (41°C) results in sequestration of mRNA into granules. MRNAs are bound to the zinc-finger protein ZC3H11, including encoding refolding chaperones, and escape heat-induced translation inhibition. At 27 °C, the mRNA is predominantly present in the untranslated cytosolic messenger ribonucleoprotein particle, but at 37 °C—41 °C the ZC 3H11 mRNA moves through the polysomal fraction. We investigated the scope and specificities of heat-shock translational regulation and granule formation, and analysed distributions of mRNAs in polysomes from 27° C to 1 hour at 39°C, and mRNA content at 41°C in heat shock granules and at 41 °C. We found that the mRNA content of mRNA that bind to the protein was stable at 39 °C and protected from sequestration in granules at 41–C. In contrast to previously seen starvation and stress granules, mRNas encode ribosomal proteins that are excluded from heat shock and are not sequestered in the granules during heat shock. These results suggest that heat shock may be an important factor in the efficiency of procyclics to develop mammalian-infective forms."

What may help explaining differences between antibiotic activity in vitro and in vivo is that current antibiotic susceptibility tests do not consider the in vivo lung environment. The lung environment contains many factors that may influence bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics. This includes lung epithelial cells, which have been shown to improve the activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Yet, how lung epithelial cells increase aminoglycoside activity is currently unknown. Here, we cultured lung epithelial cells in an in vivo-like model and found that they secrete metabolites that enhance the activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. We found that host cell secretions increased antibiotic uptake through stimulation of bacterial metabolism, which in turn resulted in enhanced activity. Our findings highlight that cross-talk between host and bacterial metabolisms contributes to the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Understanding how the host metabolism influences antibiotic activity may open up therapeutic avenues to exploit host metabolism for improving antibiotic activity and help explaining discrepancies between antibiotic efficacy in vitro and in vivo.","Antibiotic susceptibility to bacterial pathogens is typically evaluated by in vitro assays. However, there is a significant discrepancy between antibiotic efficacy and efficacy in vitro and in vivo, and whether antibiotics are effective in vitro or vice versa. In this study, we show that lung epithelial cells enhance the activity of aminoglycoside antibiotics against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the mechanism is unknown. Our study addresses this gap and provides a mechanistic understanding of the mechanisms by which lung cells stimulate the activity. We also show that in vivo-like-dimensional (3-D) lung cells, containing secreted cellular components, potentiated the bactericidal activity of the antibiotic. In contrast, the conditioned medium obtained from the cell type, grown in conventional (2-D), monolayers, did not influence antibiotic efficacy. We found that 3-D lung cells secreted endogenous metabolites (including succinate and glutamate) enhanced aminosecoside activity, and provide evidence that bacterial pyruvate metabolism was linked to the observed potentiation of antimicrobial activity. Biochemical phenotypic assays indicated that the 3-d cell conditioned medium stimulated proton motive force (PMF), resulting in increased bacterial intracellular pH. This stimulated antibiotic uptake, determined by fluorescently labelled tobramycin combination flow cytometry analysis. Our findings reveal a cross-talk between host and bacterial metabolic pathways, which influence downstream activity of antibiotics."

Using high-throughput sequencing, we have mapped RNA Polymerase II's position in the genome after depletion of termination factors from the nucleus. We found that depletion of Ysh1 and Sen1 cause build up of polymerase directly downstream of coding and non-coding genes, respectively. Depletion of Nrd1 causes an increase in polymerase that is distributed up to 1,000 bases downstream of non-coding genes. The depletion of Nrd1 helped us to identify more than 250 unique termination regions for non-coding RNAs. Within this set of newly identified non-coding termination regions, we are further able to classify them based on sequence motif similarities, suggesting a functional role for different terminator motifs. The role of these factors in transcriptional termination of coding and/or non-coding transcripts can be inferred from the effect of polymerase's position downstream of given termination sites. This method of depletion and sequencing can be used to further elucidate other factors whose importance to transcription has yet to be determined.","Yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) terminates transcription of coding transcripts in the polyadenylation (pA) pathway and non-polyadenylated (non-pA). The PAR-CLIP map of the position of Pol II in genome-wide living yeast cells shows that the cleavage of the pA site is required for efficient removal of the Pol II template. Depletion of the Ysh1 nucleus, however, leads to a runaway elongation of non-coding transcripts, whereas the depletion of Nrd1 leads to the widespread runaway and elongation. The depletion of Sen1, which leads to readthrough of the non-PCA terminators, is processive and susceptible to pausing.

While this “survival-only” response is fundamental to all physiological processes, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Many growth factors are potent regulators of cell survival through their ability to bind specific cell surface receptors, which in turn activate specialized enzymes called kinases. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a dual specificity kinase that is known to be involved in cell survival and malignant transformation, and it is able to phosphorylate both lipid and protein substrates. While the PI3K lipid kinase activity has been extensively studied, the functional significance of its protein kinase activity remains unclear. Here we show that PI3K protein kinase activity can directly phosphorylate growth factor receptors on human hematopoietic (blood) cells to promote a “survival-only” response. We further show that the protein kinase activity of PI3K can be hijacked to result in uncontrolled growth factor receptor phosphorylation and the deregulated survival of leukemic cells. Our studies provide the first evidence that the protein kinase activity of PI3K can control cell survival and that this activity may be deregulated in cancer.","Protein/lipid kinases play a critical role in the regulation of cell survival in cancer.

The fidelity of this process, and thus the health of the cell, depends critically on the proper function of proteins that direct transcription. Since hundreds of genes, each specifying a unique RNA transcript, are arranged in tandem along each chromosome, the beginning and end of each gene must be marked in the DNA sequence. Although encoded in DNA, the signal for terminating an RNA transcript is usually recognized in the transcript itself. We examined the genome-wide functional targets of six proteins implicated in transcription termination by identifying transcripts whose structure or abundance is altered by a mutation that compromises the activity of each protein. For a small minority of transcripts, a mutation in any of the six proteins disrupts termination. Much more commonly, a transcript is affected by a mutation in only one or a few of the six proteins, revealing the varying extent to which the proteins cooperate with one another. We discovered affected transcripts that were not known to be controlled by any of the six proteins, including a cohort of genes required for meiosis.","Transcriptome studies of eukaryotic cells have revealed an unexpected abundance of noncoding RNAs that are synthesized by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). However, the biogenesis of Pol II and non-coding RNA mRNAs is not well understood. In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, initiation of non-Coding transcripts by Pol II appears to be similar to that of mRNA, but there is a distinct pathway utilized for the termination of these transcripts. In this study, we examine the effect of a variety of mutations in genes encoding different essential proteins on the expression of these genes. We observe surprisingly diverse effects on transcript abundance and expression of different proteins explained simply by differences in severity of mutations. Furthermore, we infer that the results of termination of transcription by non-cytokine RNA genes are subject to complex combinatorial control that likely involves proteins studied. These results provide new targets for functions of Sen1-dependent termination, including the role of repression of meiotic genes in vegetative cells."

The clinical success of such drugs has been limited by the evolution of acquired resistance to these compounds, which leads to a relapse after initial response to therapy. Current dosing procedures are not designed to optimally delay the emergence of resistance; the identification of such optimal dosing schedules represents an important challenge in clinical cancer research. Here, we design a novel methodology to identify the optimum drug administration strategies that reach this clinical goal. Our model describes the evolutionary dynamics of a tumor cell population during therapy. We consider drug resistance emerging due to a single (epi)genetic alteration and calculate the probability of resistance arising during specific dosing strategies. We then optimize treatment protocols such that the risk of resistance is minimal while considering drug toxicity and side effects as constraints. Since this methodology can be extended to describe situations arising during administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy as well, it can be used to identify optimum drug administration schedules to avoid resistance for any cancer and treatment type.","The discovery of small molecules targeted to specific oncogenic pathways has revolutionized anti-cancer therapy.

The disease is caused by species belonging to the Paracoccidioides genus. Once inside the human host, Paracoccidioides must face the host innate immune system, escaping from the cytotoxic capacity of innate immune cells (ROS production and liberation of polypeptide antibiotics). To do so, they express and synthetize superoxide dismutases (SODs). We aimed to identify and characterize the SOD isoforms present in the Paracoccidioides genome. We identified six isoforms, among which we found an increased expression of PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 during the transition-to-yeast process, exposure to oxidative agents and interaction with phagocytic cells. Additionally, we found that PbSOD3 expression might be linked with a pronounced extracellular activity while PbSOD1 and the other isoforms seem more related to intracellular requirements of the fungus. We propose that the defence against endogenous-produced ROS may depend on intracellular Sods (mostly SOD1, but possibly also SOD2, SOD4 and SOD5), but defence against extracellular ROS (produced during host-pathogen interactions) might rely to a greater extent on SOD3, which is endowed with an extracellular activity.","The ability of Paracoccidioides to defend against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host effector cells is a prerequisite to survive and survive. To counteract these radicals, the fungus expresses, among different antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutases (SODs).

We determined gene expression levels in representative isolates from the phylogenetic lineages of the Spp. spp. (S1, PS2, PS3 and Pb01-like) using quantitative RT-PCR. Assays carried out on SOD gene expression were carried out in yeast cells, mycelia cells, yeast-to-mycelia germination, and the treatment of oxidative agents with interaction with phagocytic cells. We observed increased expression of PbSOD1 and PBSOD3 during the transition process, as well as exposure to oxidative agents and interaction with cells. These data suggest that P. brasiliensis actively responds to radicals generated by endogenously metabolism and counteracts oxidative burst of immune cells by inducing expression of SOD isoforms."

The liver is the most commonly infected organ. There are currently four treatments for CE: surgery, percutaneous treatment, medical treatment (benzimidazoles), and watch-and-wait strategy. Treatment is decided based on the WHO cyst staging. The surgical techniques employed depend on the cyst location and related complications (e.g. cyst-biliary fistulas, rupture, and secondary bacterial infection). The two principal surgical approaches are radical (resection of the cyst) and conservative (evacuation of the cyst content and partial removal of the cyst capsule) surgeries. In this study, we presented a conservative surgical approach, a standardized endocystectomy technique, that is suitable for surgical residents. This standardized endocystectomy technique is a safe procedure with acceptable morbidity, no mortality, and without recurrences in our patient series. Important components of CE management are interdisciplinary patient care, adequate diagnostic work-ups, and regular pre- and postoperative visits, including long-term follow-up for early and reliable capture of recurrences.","Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic disease caused by the cyst capsule of a cyst.

Ebolaviruses are among the most pathogenic viruses that cause human disease and represent a threat to global public health. Outbreaks of EVD occur periodically in African countries and can be exported elsewhere, with recent outbreaks including one ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the largest ever in Western Africa in 2013–2016. There is therefore a great need to develop new vaccines and treatments that target ebolaviruses. We examined whether a lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein), predicted to bind to carbohydrates present on the surface of many viruses and thereby interfere with infection, could block ebolavirus infection and be used for prevention and/or treatment of EVD. We found that the protein blocked ebolavirus infection in cell cultures and, moreover, protected a significant proportion of ebolavirus-infected mice from death, even when administered only once before exposure to virus as a preventive. The protein hence shows promise as a potential agent to prevent and/or treat EVD.","Ebolaviruses cause a rapidly fatal syndrome known as Ebola virus disease (EVD), with an average case fatality rates of ~50%.

In adults, this merging of information is optimal: more reliable sensory estimates have more influence (higher weight) in the combined, multisensory estimate. Multisensory integration can result in illusions: if a single visual flash (e.g. a bright disk appearing briefly on a screen) occurs at the same time as two beeps, we sometimes perceive two flashes. This is because auditory information is generally more reliable than vision for judging when things happen; it dominates our audio-visual percept for temporal tasks. Previous work suggests that children don’t combine information from different senses in this adult-like way until around 10 years. To investigate this further, we asked children and adults to report the number of visual flashes or auditory beeps when these were presented simultaneously. Surprisingly, all children used appropriate sensory weights: audition—the more reliable signal—tended to dominate perception, with less weight given to vision. However, children didn’t show the adult-like reduction in uncertainty until around 8–10 years. Before that age, they switched between using only auditory or only visual information on each trial.","Adults combine information from different sensory modalities to estimate object properties and size. The process of optimal sensory information is weighted according to relative reliability: reliable estimates influence the combined estimate (ii) combined estimate and the reliable component of uni-modal estimates. Previous studies suggest that optimal sensory integration may emerge at 10 years of age. Younger children rely on a single sensory modality to combine information with inappropriate sensory weights. Children aged 4–11 adults completed a simple audio-visual task that reported the number of beeps and number of flashes under uni and modal conditions. We found that in both trials, beeps differed between number 0, 1, and 2. Mutual interactions between sensory signals were evident at ages: reported number was influenced by number of simultaneously presented beeps, and vice versa. Furthermore, the relative strength of interactions predicted the relative reliabilities of the modalities, and words, observers weighted the signals appropriately. The degree of cross-motor interaction decreased with age: youngest observers ignore the task-immunity modality — fully combined vision audition— and perceived equal numbers of flashes and beeps under bi-stimal stimuli. Older observers showed smaller effects on the task. These interactions reflect optimal integration."

For example, while it is crucial to increase wake to explore a novel environment to search for potential threats and food sources, it is also necessary to decrease wake and reduce energy expenditure during prolonged absence of food. In this study, we report that a subset of neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LH) expressing the neuropeptide neurotensin (Nts) is critical for orchestrating sleep-wake responses to such challenges. We show that brief activation of NtsLH neurons in mice evokes immediate arousals from sleep, while their sustained activation increases wake, locomotor activity, and body temperature for several hours. In contrast, when NtsLH neurons are inhibited, mice are neither able to sustain wake in a novel environment nor able to reduce wake during food deprivation. These data suggest that NtsLH neurons may be necessary for generating appropriate sleep-wake responses to a wide variety of environmental and physiological challenges.","Sleep wakefulness is greatly influenced by physiological and psychological factors, but the neuronal elements responsible for organizing sleep-wake behavior response are largely unknown.

Neurons encoding these interaural time differences (ITDs) receive an excitatory synaptic input from each ear. They can perform a microsecond computation with excitatory synapses that have millisecond time scale because they are extremely sensitive to the input's “rise time,” the time taken to reach the peak of the synaptic input. Current theories assume that the biophysical properties of the two inputs are identical. We challenge this assumption by showing that the rise times of excitatory synaptic potentials driven by the ipsilateral ear are faster than those driven by the contralateral ear. Further, we present a computational model demonstrating that this disparity in rise times, together with the neurons' sensitivity to excitation's rise time, can endow ITD-encoding with microsecond resolution in the biologically relevant range. Our analysis also resolves a timing mismatch. The difference between contralateral and ipsilateral latencies is substantially larger than the relevant ITD range. We show how the rise time disparity compensates for this mismatch. Generalizing, we suggest that phasic-firing neurons—those that respond to rapidly, but not to slowly, changing stimuli—are selective to the temporal ordering of brief inputs. In a coincidence-detection computation the neuron will respond more robustly when a faster input leads a slower one, even if the inputs are brief and have similar amplitudes.","Low-frequency sound localization depends on neural computation of interaural time differences (ITD). ITD relies on neurons in the auditory brain stem to integrate synaptic inputs delivered to the ipsi- and contralateral auditory pathways that start in the ears. However, auditory neurons respond selectively to ITD found in the medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO). We have identified a new mechanism for ITD coding in the brain slice preparation that preserves binaural inputs from MSO neurons. We show that the internal latency difference between excitatory and post-synaptic potential (PSP) slopes provides a robust compensatory delay mechanism for differential activation of low threshold potassium conductance inputs. Our results suggest that, generally, the dependence on spike probability rate and depolarization, in auditory neurons, provides a mechanism for temporal order discrimination of EPSPs."

We hypothesize that in addition to fungal and oomycete pathogens, the bacterial model plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae also protects itself in the apoplast by secreting inhibitors targeting these apoplastic hydrolases. The genome of P. syringe harbours over 131 genes encoding putative small, non-annotated secreted proteins that have not been characterized previously. Here, we produced and purified 43 of these small proteins and tested them for their ability to inhibit the secreted immune protease C14 of tomato. We discovered a C14 protease inhibitor, coined Cip1, which carries chagasin-like motifs and contributes to virulence. Cip1 also effectively inhibits Pip1, another immune protease of tomato, known to suppress P. syringae infection. Interestingly, Cip1 has a lower affinity for the immune protease Rcr3, explaining why this protein, and PtoDC3000 producing Cip1, is not recognized in tomato plants carrying the Cf-2 resistance gene, which uses Rcr3 as a co-receptor to detect pathogen invasion.","Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) is an extracellular model plant pathogen, and its potential to produce secreted effectors to manipulate the apoplast has been investigated.

We screened for the ability to inhibit the secreted immune protease C14 in tomato by competitive activity-based protein profiling. We found that C14- inhibiting protein-1 (Cip1) contains motifs of chagasin-like protease inhibitors. Cip1 mutants are virulent in tomato, demonstrating the importance of the effector as a protease inhibitor. We also identified a protein called Pip1, which has a close homolog to Rcr3, which is recognized in tomato plants carrying the Cf-2 resistance gene.

SHM mutates the regions encoding the antigen-binding site, generating high-affinity antibodies. CSR allows B cells to switch the class of antibody they produce (from IgM to IgA, IgG or IgE), providing novel effector functions. Together, SHM and CSR establish highly specific and pathogen-adapted antibody responses. SHM and CSR are initiated by the recruitment of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) enzyme to antibody genes. Once recruited, AID induces DNA lesions that are processed into mutations during SHM or chromosomal DNA breaks during CSR. These breaks activate multiple DNA repair proteins and are resolved by replacing the IgM gene segments by those encoding IgA, IgG or IgE. AID carries a significant oncogenic potential that needs to be controlled to preserve genome integrity. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that Poly(ADP)ribose polymerase 3 (Parp3), an enzyme recently implicated in DNA repair, contributes to antibody diversification by negatively regulating CSR without affecting SHM. We show that Parp3 facilitates the repair of AID-induced DNA damage and controls AID levels on chromatin. We propose that Parp3 protects antibody genes from sustained AID-dependent DNA damage.","In order to generate highly specific adapted immune responses, B cells must diversify their antibody repertoire. This is achieved through the generation of programmed DNA damage. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) class switch recombination (CSR) is initiated by recruitment of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to immunoglobulin loci and subsequent generation of DNA lesions. In this study, we examined the contribution of Parp3 and Parp2 to the CSR. We found that Parp1 is enhanced in CSR, but not in SHM, and that SHM remains unaffected. Mechanistically, increased occupancy of the AID donor (Sμ) switch region junctions bias the alternative end joining in the absence of parp3. Our results suggest that ParP3 plays a CSR-specific role in controlling AID levels at switch regions."

We term the first of these mechanisms “network-driven synchrony”, which is characterized by the presence of cycles within the macroscopic network. The second mechanism we term “node-driven”, which is characterized by the ability of an individual node (or nodes) to drive synchrony across the rest of the network, due to the hierarchical structure of the macroscopic network. By applying this framework to routine clinically collected resting state data from people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and from age matched healthy controls, we demonstrate that functional networks of people with epilepsy have a significantly enhanced capacity to synchronize than those of people without epilepsy. This finding suggests a critical role for the connectivity structure of large-scale networks in the tendency to have seizures. Further, by deriving a mathematical equation for the global synchrony of the network, we make it computationally tractable to analyze data in close to real time. This gives our method potential to be used within the clinic as a diagnostic aid for clinicians treating neurological disease.","Epilepsy is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people in the world. It is caused by a variety of brain disorders, including idiopathic and generalized epilepsies.

We developed a novel vaccine containing two protective antigens of V. cholerae, TcpA and CTB, incorporated into a defined oligomeric protein chimera. CTB is the non-toxic binding domain of cholera toxin, the protein that causes profuse watery diarrhea in cholera patients. TcpA is the subunit of the toxin-coregulated pilus, a V. cholerae surface structure that is required for intestinal colonization and disease. Intraperitoneal immunization of adult female mice with this TcpA-A2-CTB chimera elicited stronger early anti-TcpA responses and equivalent anti-CTB responses compared to immunizing with a TcpA+CTB mixture. Furthermore, all reared infant mice from females immunized with the chimera or TcpA+CTB were protected against a large challenge dose of V. cholerae that was sufficient to kill all infant mice from non-immunized control and TcpA- or CTB-immunized adults. Our study supports the concept of including both TcpA and CTB as antigens in development of a safe and effective subunit vaccine against cholera.","Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera in humans and animals. Cholera toxin (CT) and toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) are the primary virulence factors. CT causes profuse watery diarrhea, while TCP ( composed of repeating copies of major pilin TcpA) is required for intestinal colonization. Antibodies to CT and TcpB protect mice from infection. We developed a vaccine that elicits anti-CTB antibodies in mice and evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of this vaccine in an infant mouse model of the disease. Adult female CD-1 mice were immunized intraperitoneally and three times more times than mice immunized with the same combination of CT and TCB. The immunization of dams with the TCPA+CTB mixture was comparable to that of those immunized against the TcpC-FliC and flagellin subunit of FliC adjuvant, CTB. Blood and fecal samples were analyzed for antigen-specific IgG and IgA, respectively, and quantitative ELISA. Immunized females mated; reared offspring were challenged orogastrically for 10 to 20 LD50 with V. cholae El Tor N16961; vaccine efficacy was assessed in the challenged pups 48 hrs after immunization. Weight loss analysis showed that immunization with the dams with both the CTA-A2-TcpB and chimera and the TCB mixture protected pups from excess weight loss and severe diarrhea. These data support the concept of including Tcpa and CTB immunogens in the development of an effective multivalent subunit vaccine against V.cholerae."

A key driver of resistance is that drug resistance mutations often persist even in the absence of drugs and despite the fact that resistance mutations are often associated with reduced pathogen replication (“fitness costs”). Such persistence may occur because fitness costs are low, especially if they are compensated by additional mutations in their “genetic background”. Here we assessed the role of fitness-cost and the genetic background for resistance in a real-world epidemiological setting by studying the persistence behavior of transmitted antiretroviral resistance mutations of HIV. This persistence behavior was associated with the predicted fitness cost of a given resistance mutation in the particular genetic background in which it occurred. We found that persistence behavior varied strongly across both mutation types and genetic backgrounds and that persistence was significantly associated with predicted fitness costs. In particular we found that even mutations of the same type tended to persist longer if they occurred in a genetic background where they caused weak fitness costs. Overall our results underline the variability of persistence behavior as well as the important role of fitness costs and the genetic background in the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.","Transmission of drug-resistant pathogens presents a near-universal challenge in fighting infectious diseases. Transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) persist in the absence of drugs for considerable time. It is generally believed that differential TDRM- persistence is caused, partially, by variations in the fitness-cost of mutations. However, in vivo epidemiological evidence of the impact of fitness costs on disease persistence is rare. In this study, we studied the persistence of HIV-1 in longitudinally- sampled nucleotide sequences from the Swiss-HIV- Cohort-Study (SHCS). We found that the fitness costs of the mutation varied substantially between 174.0/100-person-years;CI=[51.4, 588.8] ( 184V) and 2.7/100–person-year;[0.7, 10.9] ( 215D). The fitness costs for the mutation increased significantly with the fitness cost (increase of 1.6[1.3,2.0] standard deviation fitness costs) and the average fitness cost of a mutation given genetic background. Subdividing fitness costs by average fitness costs given mutation and the deviation from the average of fitness cost mutation given the genetic background, we found that components were significantly associated with reversion-rate. These results suggest that substantial variations in TDRMR persistence in absence drugs are associated with fitness and cost differences between mutations from different genetic backgrounds."

NK cells recognize and kill diseased cells using receptors for self antigens (HLA) that are frequently altered on aberrant cells. The HLA receptors are known as Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors, or KIR. Humans possess from four to 14 KIR receptor genes in their genome, and individual NK cells express a subset of the available KIR genes, generating specialized NK cells that detect alterations in specific HLA proteins. The mechanism of this unusual selective gene activation was recently shown by our group to be controlled by a probabilistic bi-directional promoter switch that turns on a given gene at a pre-determined frequency in the NK cell population. The current study shows that the properties of the switches in terms of the relative activity of forward (on) versus reverse (off) promoter activity is directly correlated with the frequency at which a given gene is expressed within the NK cell population. These results have important implications for our understanding of the role of NK cells in viral resistance and bone marrow transplants.","Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the elimination of tumors and virus-infected cells by the innate immune system.

Through whole-genome sequencing we found variations in the copy number of chromosomes in addition to gene amplification and gene deletion events in antimony-resistant parasites. A marker previously related to antimony resistance, the gene coding for multidrug resistant protein A, was found to be amplified. Transport studies revealed a reduced antimony accumulation in resistant parasites that we correlated with the deletion of the gene coding for the aquaglyceroporin 1 (AQP1) responsible for antimony uptake in Leishmania. Additionally, a point mutation in AQP1 was found to be associated with antimony resistance.

The segment covering 30 genes on chromosome 19 was amplified in intracromosomally mutants. The gene coding for multidrug resistance was associated with a protein involved in antimony resistance amplified in the amplified mutants, likely by chromosomal translocation. The mutants displayed reduced accumulation of antimony mainly due to genomic alterations at the level of the subtelomeric region of chromosome 31 harboring the gene coding aquaglyceroporin 1 (LgAQP1). Resistance was also associated with loss of LgAqP1 in subtelomers and deletions in the mutants.

MprF, initially discovered in the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, protects bacteria against ‘innate human antibiotics’ such as the defensin peptides. In addition, MprF has recently been implicated in resistance to the new defensin-like antibiotic daptomycin. MprF modifies bacterial membrane lipids with the amino acid l-lysine, which leads to electrostatic repulsion of the membrane-damaging peptides. The molecular mechanism of MprF has remained largely unknown. We demonstrate that MprF represents a novel bifunctional type of enzyme. The N- and C-terminal domains of MprF are both required for mediating antimicrobial peptide resistance but they can be expressed as two separate proteins without loss of function indicating that they represent distinct functional modules. While the C-terminal domain accomplishes lipid lysinylation the N-terminal membrane-embedded domain is required to expose the lysine lipid at the outer surface of the bacterial membrane where it is able to repulse the antimicrobial peptides. These findings unravel the molecular basis of an important bacterial immune evasion mechanism and they may help to employ MprF as a target for new anti-virulence drugs.","Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most virulent pathogens in the world.

We also show that the membrane-level lys-piggycerol production of Lys- PG is essential for Lys-G production. Notably, Lys-Piggyc production was required to lead to efficient and efficient resistance to CAMP. Furthermore, the large N-terminally hydrophobic domain of the large membrane protein was absent, indicating a crucial role for this protein in the bacterial immune evasion mechanism.

We revealed the fine composition of the PE/PPE-specific T cells by characterizing their effector functions and differentiation status. We previously described a live attenuated mycobacterial strain as a vaccine candidate that is able to induce such CD4+ T cells and which displays particular properties at stimulating the cells of the innate immune system.

We have previously reported series of small molecule protease inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity against important human and animal coronaviruses. In this report, we provide, for the first time, experimental evidence of efficacy and safety of one of the protease inhibitors in laboratory cats with experimentally induced FIP.

The dynamic nature of coronavirus infections in mammalian species has contributed to a relatively high mutation rate and high recombination rates. This dynamic nature has also contributed to the cross-species transmission and shifts in tissue cell tropism in the host, resulting in a substantial change in virulence. Feline enteric coronaviral (FECV) causes inapparent mild enteritis in cats, a highly fatal disease, called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP is caused by a mutation in the FIP virus. The pathogenesis of FIP has been intimately associated with immune responses and involves depletion of T cells, features shared by coronavirus like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Coronavirus. However, there are no effective antiviral drugs available. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of a 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitor in laboratory cats with FIP. Experimental FIP was 100% fatal and certain clinical laboratory signs were apparent. Antiviral treatment was associated with rapid improvement in fever, ascites, lymphopenia and gross signs of illness in cats and returned to normal health within 20 days after treatment. These results indicate that continuous virus replication is required for the progression of immune-mediated inflammatory disease in FIP and provide important insights for devising therapeutic strategies for selection of antiviral compounds for development of important coronavIRuses in animals in humans."

Because all humans are related to one another, even if very distantly, all people are inbred to various degrees. From a genetic standpoint, it is well known that inbreeding increases the risk that a child will have a rare recessive genetic disease, but there is also increasing interest in understanding whether inbreeding is a risk factor for more common, complex disorders such as schizophrenia. In this investigation, we used single-nucleotide polymorphism data to quantify the degree to which 9,388 schizophrenia cases and 12,456 controls were inbred, and we tested the hypothesis that people whose genome shows higher evidence of being inbred are at higher risk of having schizophrenia. We estimate that the odds of schizophrenia increase by ∼17% for every 1% increase in inbreeding. This finding is consistent with a role for multiple recessive or partially recessive alleles in the etiology of schizophrenia, and it suggests that genetic variants that increase the risk of schizophrenia have been selected against over evolutionary time.","Schizophrenia is a genetic disorder caused by the accumulation of chromosomal segments that are identical to the common ancestor inherited from the inherited parent.

Is this due to random loss in small populations, as is thought to be the case for the extreme genome degradation of intracellular symbionts, or due to selection? And if it is beneficial, is it directly caused by replicating a shorter genome or advantageous loss of the genes themselves? We uncovered that most replicate populations of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 evolved in the laboratory for 1,500 generations lost nearly 10% of their genome. Through reconstructing these deletions, we demonstrated that these losses were indeed beneficial, but the advantage did not scale with length of genome lost, and were even deleterious in alternative environments. These findings suggest that the initial stages of genome shrinkage may be driven by selection, ultimately leading to a more streamlined, specialized organism.","Genome reduction has been observed in many bacterial lineages that have adapted to specialized environments. However, the process of genome degradation seen in obligate pathogens and symbionts appears dominated by genetic drift. In contrast, free-living organisms reduced genomes, a dominant force proposed to be direct selection for smaller, streamlined genomes. The variation in gene content of free-standing species, called “attribution” genes, is commonly gained by gaining large chromosomal islands that are adaptive for many adaptive traits, such as pathogenicity. It is generally unclear, however, whether this process of accessory gene loss is largely driven by drift or selection. Here, we demonstrate that selection for gene loss, shortened genome, se, drove a massive, rapid reduction of accessory genes. We show that over 1,500 generations of experimental evolution, 80% of populations of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 experienced nearly parallel deletions removing 10% of the genome of the megaplasmid present strain. The absence of deletion events in the mutation accumulation experiment suggested that selection, drift, dominated the process. Reconstructing deletions confirmed beneficial selective regimes, which led to decreased performance in alternative environments. Our results indicate that selection is crucial for eliminating unnecessary genes in the early stages of adaptation to a specialized environment."

On the other hand, the risk of tuberculosis in patients with good glycemic control (fasting glucose ≤ 130 mg/dl) did not differ significantly from that of individuals without diabetes.There was a linear relationship between fasting plasma glucose at baseline and subsequent risk of tuberculosis.Assuming that these findings imply a causal effect of glycemic control on tuberculosis, 7.5% of incident tuberculosis cases could be prevented if all diabetic patients in the study population achieved good glycemic control.Diabetes control has the potential to complement current tuberculosis control efforts, above and beyond its impact on reducing the burden of non-communicable disease.","Diabetes is a well-known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) and is increasingly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. Glycemic control has potential to modify the risk of TB in patients with diabetes. However, the association between glycemic control and TB risk is inconsistent.

Resistance always involved increases in the number of the circulating hemocytes, which are the blood cells that kill parasitoids. However, one species moved sessile hemocytes into circulation while the other species simply produce more cells. These changes are extremely costly, which explains why these species are susceptible to parasitism in nature. Whether a population evolves resistance depends on ecological conditions, as resistance is only costly when food is in short supply, and evolving resistance to one parasite can have the added benefit of providing resistance to other parasites.","Drosophila is a mosquito-borne protozoan parasite that infects millions of people worldwide. In order to understand the causes of variation in susceptibility to infection, we have developed a model system in which flies collected single populations of different species from different species of the parasite D. melanogaster and artificially selected resistance to the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. We found that resistance to both species involves a large increase in the number of circulating hemocytes that kill parasitoids. However, different species achieve different ways of killing the parasites. In this study, we investigated the convergent evolution of the immune phenotype in different developmental bases. We show that the evolution of resistance depends on ecological conditions including food availability and the presence of different parasite species."

S. haematobium eggs tend to be deposited in the tissue of pelvic organs such as the urinary bladder, lower ureters, cervix and vagina. Key sequelae include hematuria, dysuria, urinary frequency, and an increased risk of bladder cancer. This form of schistosomiasis can also cause dyspareunia, vaginal bleeding, pruritis, and granulomata that appear as tumors in the female genital tract. Collectively, these signs and symptoms are termed female genital schistosomiasis (FGS). Recent studies suggest that FGS occurs more commonly in girls and women with HIV, suggesting that it may be a risk factor for becoming HIV-infected. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of this co-infection is not well understood. A lack of an experimentally manipulable model has contributed to the paucity of research focusing on this parasite. We have circumvented the barriers to natural S. haematobium oviposition in the mouse by directly microinjecting parasite eggs into the vaginal mucosa. The injection of S. haematobium ova appears to trigger vaginal inflammation and scarring infiltration by leukocytes expressing HIV co-receptors, and increased urinary frequency. Our approach may provide a representative animal model that could contribute to new opportunities to better understand the basic molecular and cellular immunology of female genital schistosomiasis.","Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the parasitic worm Schistosoma haematobium. FGS occurs in the female reproductive tract of adult worms and can lead to pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and genital disfigurement. Recent evidence suggests that co-infection with S. haematomobium increases the risks of contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. However, the associated mechanisms remain unclear. We sought to create a mouse model conducive to the study of immune modulation and genitourinary changes that occur during FGS. We injected the eggs into the posterior vaginal walls of 30 female BALB/c mice injected with uninfected LVG hamster tissue extract.

Numerous studies have elucidated the important roles of mitochondrial energy in fasting status but less is known about the role of mitochondria in fed status. Two recent studies elucidated the importance of nutrient-induced mitochondrial functions [1,2] in mammalian longevity, but these studies did not either address how these critical nutrient-induced mitochondrial functions are integrated with nutrient-enhanced antioxidant capacities—nor identify how the carbon and nitrogen balance is maintained. Our study reveals CAPER, as the `first’ example of a coregulator nodal integrator which eukaryotes share to orchestrate both nutrient-induced mitochondrial energy metabolism by coactivating ERR-α-Gabpa and stress-induced adaptive metabolic responses via NF- κB/c-Myc; this allows maintenance of carbon-nitrogen balance as well as preservation of life span and reproductive capacity. These metabolic roles for the CAPER coactivator in energy homeostasis are highly conserved and crucial for life span and reproduction in human cells and C. elegans.","Mito-nuclear communication is essential for the survival of eukaryotic cells. In addition, reactive oxygen species are required for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which demands safeguards against harmful byproducts. In this study, we identified a critical transcriptional integrator of mitochondria to orchestrate nutrient-induced mitochondrial energy metabolism and stress-induced nuclear responses, maintaining carbon-nitrogen balance, and preserving life span and reproductive capacity. Inhibition of nutrient-mediated expression of CAPER arrests nutrient-dependent cell proliferation and ATP generation and induces autophagy-mediated vacuolization. Nutrient signaling by CAPER induces mitochondrial transcription of glucose-dependent mitochondrial respiration and coactivation of the nuclear receptor ERR-α-mediated Gabpa transcription. CAPER coactivator NF-κB directly regulates c-Myc to coordinate nuclear transcriptome responses to mitochondrial stress. Finally, CAPER is responsible for anaplerotic carbon flux, TCA cycles, and glycolysis, and amino acids and fatty acids in order to maintain cellular energy metabolism. Collectively, our studies reveal a conserved ‘master’ regulatory mechanism for eukarianotic cells to control vital homeostasis of ATP and mitochondria, and demonstrate that CAPER-dependent coordinated control of nuclear mitochondrial transcriptomic programs and metabolisms is highly conserved."

EBV usually infects B lymphocytes and does not produce symptoms in infected individuals, but in rare occasions it infects T or NK lymphocytes and causes severe diseases such as chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV) and EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH). We developed mouse models of these two human diseases in which EBV-infected T or NK lymphocytes proliferate in mouse tissues and reproduce human pathologic conditions such as overproduction of small proteins called “cytokines” that produce inflammatory responses in the body. These mouse models are thought to be very useful for the elucidation of the pathogenesis of CAEBV and EBV-HLH as well as for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these diseases. Experiments with the models demonstrated that a subset of lymphocytes called CD4-positive lymphocytes are essential for the proliferation of EBV-infected T and NK cells. This result implies that removal of CD4-positive lymphocytes or suppression of their functions may be an effective strategy for the treatment of CAEBV and EBV-HLH.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous B-lymphotropic herpesvirus that is ectopically infects T and NK cells and can cause severe diseases with unknown pathogenesis, including chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV), EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and EBV–HEMHLH.

The meningococcal Opa proteins are important in mediating adhesion to and invasion of human tissues, and are important for evasion of the host immune response. They are encoded by a repertoire of 3–4 genomic loci in each meningococcus and exhibit high levels of sequence diversity. Here we analyzed the Opa repertoires of a large, well-characterised, asymptomatically carried meningococcal isolate collection. We found that the Opa repertoires were specific to individual meningococcal genotypes, similar to that observed in isolates from cases of invasive disease. These repertoires exhibited discrete, non-overlapping structure at a population level, and yet low within-repertoire diversity. These data were consistent with the predictions of a mathematical model of strong immune selection, suggesting that the collective immune response of the host population shapes the antigenic diversity of the meningococcal Opa repertoire. This study provides new insights into Opa-mediated meningococcal pathogenesis and the effect of host population immunity on the biodiversity and population structure of bacterial pathogens. These data may also have implications for the design of new meningococcal vaccines based on surface proteins.","Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram negative bacterium that infects the human host.

This is particularly evident when comparing parenchymal with extraparenchymal patients and ventricular with subarachnoid patients. Gender and age also modulate some characteristics of the disease. In conclusion, parasite location is one of the most important features of the disease, which must be considered when approaching an NCC patient.","Extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis (ExPNCC) is an infection caused by Taenia solium cysticerci that mainly occurs in the ventricular compartment (Ve) and basal subarachnoid space (SAb) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with ExPNCC. Demographic, clinical, and radiological features of patients affected by exPNCC have been described compared to ParNCC patients.429 patients were confirmed with diagnosis of neurocystercosis, attending the Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía, tertiary reference center in Mexico City, 2000–2014, and were included in the study. The data were statistically analyzed to assess potential differences depending on the cyst location and determine the effects of age and sex on the disease presentation. In total, 238 patients were included. In respect of parenchysal cysts, extraparenchiesal parasites were diagnosed with older age (P = 0.002), chiefly caused by intracranial hypertension (P <0.0001), frequently multiple vesicular (P<0.001), and CSF patients showed higher protein concentration and cell count. SAb patients were diagnosed in older age than Ve patients, showed frequently seizures, vesicle cysticers, and higher CSF cellularity. Gender and age modulated traits of the disease."

It mainly affects the central highlands, but also has caused several large outbreaks in the port city of Mahajanga, after it was reintroduced there in the 1990s. Despite its prevalence, the genetic diversity and related geographic distribution of different genetic groups of Y. pestis in Madagascar has been difficult to study due to the great genetic similarity among isolates. We subtyped a set of Malagasy isolates and identified two major genetic groups that were subsequently divided into 11 and 4 subgroups, respectively. Y. pestis appears to be maintained in several geographically separate subpopulations. There is also evidence for multiple long distance transfers of Y. pestis, likely human mediated. Such transfers have resulted in the reintroduction and establishment of plague in the port city of Mahajanga where there is evidence for multiple transfers both from and to the central highlands. The maintenance and spread of Y. pestis in Madagascar is a dynamic and highly active process that relies on the natural cycle between the primary host, the black rat, and its flea vectors as well as human activity.","Plague was introduced to Madagascar in 1898 and continues to be a significant human health problem.

Here, we examine island-wide geographic-genetic patterns based on whole-genome discovery of SNPs, SNP genotyping and hypervariable variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci to gain insight into the maintenance of the spread of plague in Madagascar. We analyzed a set of 262 Malagasy isolates and set of 56 SNPs and 43-locus multi- locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) system. We identified geographic distribution of subclades and identified patterns related to maintenance of plague spread in Madagascar in addition to SNP differences. We identify two major groups, Groups I and II, which were subsequently divided into 11 and 4 subgroups, respectively. We also find evidence of multiple long distance transfers of plague to Madagascar, likely human mediated. These transfers resulted in the reintroduction of plague into the port city of Mahajanga, which is likely to have been facilitated by multiple transfers to other parts of the island."

Blood digestion offers challenges to the insect, like managing high concentrations of heme and iron, pro-oxidant and potentially toxic molecules derived from hemoglobin. Mosquitoes and other blood-feeding arthropods have evolved adaptations to overcome this problem, such as the activation of catalase, an antioxidant enzyme that protect tissues against toxic free radicals. Mosquitoes act as important vectors of human diseases because during a blood meal they might also ingest microorganism circulating in our blood, such as dengue and zika virus. The adaptive antioxidant program that protects mosquito tissues against the oxidative challenge imposed by a blood meal might also influences the ability of virus to establish infection and disseminate from the midgut to the salivary glands. We show here that catalase differentially influences the number of infected midguts after mosquitoes were challenged with blood contaminated with virus, being beneficial to Dengue-4 but neutral do Zika, suggesting that redox metabolism may have distinct roles on mosquito vector competence towards different arbovirus.","Aedes aegypti is a mosquito-borne arboviral pathogen that infects millions of people worldwide. In this study, we show that the antioxidant capacity of the midgut is increased by the ingestion of a blood meal. We found that blood ingestion triggers an antioxidant response in the mosquito to protect cells from oxidative stress. This antioxidant response is mediated by RNAi-mediated silencing of catalase (AAEL013407-RB), which reduces enzyme activity in the midgiut epithelia, increased H2O2 leakage, and decreased fecundity and lifespan of mosquitoes fed H2o2. In addition, we found that the inhibition of Catalase knockdown reduced Dengue 4, Zika, infection intensity (number of plaque forming units/midgut) and 7 days after the infectious meal. These data suggest that the redox balance in the insect may influence mosquito vectorial competence."

This regulation requires the precise positioning of nucleosomes along DNA. Chromatin remodelers are the molecular machines that consume ATP to slide nucleosome at their correct locations, but the mechanisms of remodeling are still unclear. Based on the static structural information of a remodeler bound on nucleosome, we performed molecular dynamics computer simulations revealing the details of how remodelers slide nucleosomal DNA: the inchworm-like motion of remodelers create small DNA deformations called twist defects, which then spontaneously propagate throughout the nucleosome to induce sliding. These simulations explain several past experimental findings and are important for our understanding of genome organization.","Chromatin remodelers are molecular machines that control genome organization by repositioning, ejecting, and editing nucleosomes. These activities confer essential regulatory roles in gene expression and DNA replication. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanism of active nucleosome sliding by molecular dynamics simulations of the Snf2 remodeler translocase complex in the DNA. We show that in inchworm motion driven by ATP consumption, the translocases overwrites the original nucleosomal energy landscape, and steric electrostatic interactions induce sliding of the entire DNA unidirectionally. The sliding initiated by the remodeling of the DNA sequence and the binding location of a pair of twist defects, spontaneously propagate to complete sliding across the entire nucleoome. Our results offer a detailed mechanistic picture of remodeling and are important for a complete understanding of key biological processes."

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), isolated in Asian countries during the 1990s, has a worldwide distribution and was the first mammarenavirus isolated. In 2014, a second mammarenavirus, Wēnzhōu virus (WENV), was identified in rodents in Zhejiang Province of China and later in Guangdong, Shandong, and Hainan Provinces. Most importantly, WENV or related viruses were reported in Thailand and Cambodia. In Cambodia, the isolated virus was associated with human respiratory diseases. In this study, we detected WENV or related viruses in Yunnan Province and found a high prevalence in rats of two species (Rattus norvegicus and R. tanezumi). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete L and S segments of five strains showed that these viruses form an independent phylogenetic branch in WENV clade most closely related to WENVs found in China and Cambodia. Considering the wide spread distribution of rats and altered distribution patterns due to ecological changes, we propose that these viruses may have a wider prevalence and be found in countries from South-eastern Asia to China. Given that WENV may be associated with human diseases, it is necessary to improve surveillances of these viruses in their natural reservoirs and in humans.","Mammarenaviruses are associated with human hemorrhagic fever diseases in Africa and America.

Mutation of the epigenetic regulator CBX2 leads to ovary development in XY embryos, suggesting a critical role for chromatin remodeling during sex determination. However, the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the testis vs. ovary cell-fate decision in the mammalian bipotential gonad are poorly understood. In this study, we developed a genome-wide profile of two histone modifications that play critical roles during development: H3K27me3 (repressive) and H3K4me3 (active). We find that sex-determining genes that are initially co-expressed in XX and XY bipotential gonads are bivalent (marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) prior to sex determination, poised to engage either the testis or ovary fate. Remarkably, after sex determination, repressed genes that promote the alternate fate remain bivalent. We show that stabilization of the testis fate requires CBX2-mediated repression of bivalent ovary-determining genes, which would otherwise block testis development. Our study provides insight into how the bipotential state of the gonad is established at the epigenetic level, and how the testis fate is stabilized by repression of the ovary fate during sex determination.","The XY XY fetal gonads are initially bipotential, poised for the ovary and testis fate. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the commitment to the testis and its fate requires repression of genes associated with ovary fate. We have previously shown that loss of CBX2, a subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that binds to H3K27me3 mediates silencing, leads to ovary development in XY mice and humans. However, we have not previously shown a direct role for the repressor of the antagonistic ovary-promoting pathway Sry. To investigate this possibility, we developed a quantitative genome-wide profile of the repressive histone mark of H3k27me2 and its active counterpart in XY XX gonadal supporting cells for sex determination. We found that Sry expression is rescued in XY Cbx2-/-;Wnt4-/- mice, providing insight into the relationship between testis development and sex determination at the epigenetic level. Furthermore, we found that CBX1 directly binds to the Wnt signaler Lef1, an ovary promoting gene that remains bivalent in Sertoli cells. Our results suggest that stabilization of testis/sry fate requires the repression of bivalent ovary genes, which may block testis formation."

During meiosis, chromosomes recombine and segregate twice consecutively to produce haploid daughter cells, which differentiate into gametes. In humans, errors in meiosis are the leading causes of congenital birth defects. In plants, bypassing the meiotic program can lead to production of clonal seeds that retain hybrid traits that otherwise segregate. Thus, understanding the controls of meiosis has major implications for both health and crop improvement. How meiotic gene expression is regulated in multicellular eukaryotes to promote entry into and progression through the meiotic program is poorly understood. Here we identify DUET, a protein essential for male meiosis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, as a regulator of meiotic gene expression. We found that DUET is required for proper expression of JAS and TDM1. These genes function in male meiosis, and regulate spindle organization during meiosis II and cell cycle transitions, respectively. Expression of DUET at the end of prophase coincides with the onset of TDM1 expression, and DUET directly binds TDM1, indicating TDM1 is a direct target of DUET. Our results provide an initial framework for further elucidating the developmental and molecular controls of meiotic gene expression in plants.","Meiosis is the first step in the development of haploid cells that are essential for sexual reproduction. In yeast, entry into meiosis activates transcription factors that trigger a transcriptional cascade that results in sequential co-expression of early, middle and late meiotic genes. However, how these factors are conserved, and what regulatory mechanisms ensure proper meiotic gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes, is poorly understood. Here, we report that DUET/MMD1, a PHD finger protein essential for Arabidopsis male meiosis, functions as transcriptional regulator of plant meiosis. DUET-PHD binds to H3K4me2 in vitro, an interaction that is critical for meiosis I. We find that DUet is required for proper microtubule organization and meiosis II, independently of function in both meiosis and I. Remarkably, DUET protein shows stage-specific expression, confined to diplotene. We also identify genes that are critical for cell cycle transitions and spindle organization in male and female meiosis in plants. Our results suggest that the action of DUET as a transcription regulator in male meiotic plants may stagewise control of plants in yeast."

One of the key molecules in determining elimination of Leishmania parasites from the infected host cell is the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ). The aim of this study was to investigate which immune response genes are associated with the production of IFN-γ in the context of Leishmania infection. We identified individuals that are high- or low IFN-γ producers upon stimulation of their peripheral blood cells with Leishmania parasites. We then determined the immune gene expression profile of these individuals and we identified a set of genes that are differentially expressed comparing high- and low IFN-γ producers. The expression of these genes was also evaluated in patients with CL and in individuals with a subclinical Leishmania infection (SC). In this setting, the overall pattern of expression of this particular gene combination discriminated the CL patients x from SC individuals. Understanding the initial response to Leishmania may lead to the identification of markers that are associated with development of CL.","Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease caused by the parasite Leishmania braziliensis.

Before the cell divides, it first duplicates its genome and separates the chromosomes into the two newly forming daughter cells, a task carried out by a structure called the spindle apparatus, which is composed mostly of long polymers called microtubules. The site of cleavage must occur between the segregating chromosomes—at the spindle equator—to ensure that each cell receives the proper number of chromosomes. In addition to separating the chromosomes, microtubules are also essential for inducing cytokinesis—but how they do this is controversial. For example, the “polar relaxation” hypothesis proposes that the astral microtubules, which radiate outward, cause contractile elements to flow from the polar cortex toward the equator, resulting in furrowing. In contrast, the “equatorial stimulation” hypothesis proposes that the spindle microtubules directly stimulate cleavage exclusively at the equator. Using a novel approach, we demonstrate that both mechanisms are in fact functioning together to recruit actin filaments to the nascent ring, providing redundancy that increases fidelity. Specifically, we were able to mechanically alter the distribution of actin filaments in living, dividing cells by using a microscopic needle to manipulate microtubules while perturbing the cytoskeleton with chemical compounds. Our high-resolution microscopy data advance the understanding of both proposed mechanisms. We also documented a novel, microtubule-based mechanism for transporting actin aggregates to the equatorial cortex. These results help to resolve a long-standing dispute concerning this fundamental cellular process.","Cytokinesis is powered by the contraction of actomyosin filaments in the newly assembled contractile ring. Microtubules are a spindle component essential for the induction of cytokinesis. In addition, induction can use central spindle and/or astral microtubules to stimulate cortical contraction at the spindle equator (equatorial stimulation). Alternatively, induction may rely on astral and microtubule bundles to relax the polar cortex (polar relaxation). Here, we investigate the relationship between the distribution of actin in living silkworm spermatocytes. Mechanically repositioned, noninterdigitating microtubular bundles induce the redistribution of the actin region in the cortex locally excluding cortical actin and filaments. In contrast, repositioning of interdigitating subtubules using a novel mechanism to induce local stimulation of contractility in polar cortex; antiparallel plus ends of the central and astral subtubule bundle, actin aggregates rapidly assembled de novo and transported laterally to the laterally equatorial cortex. Our results suggest that polar relaxation and equatorial stimulation mechanisms redundantly supply actin to the contractile rings, increasing fidelity and cleavage."

Of note, expression of the                    intracellular 2B4 adaptor molecule SAP, which leads to an activation of the                    cell, decreased with higher 2B4 expression levels. Finally, we were able to show                    that 2B4 cross-linking can counter-act enhanced proliferation of HCV-specific                    CD8+ T cells seen upon PD-1 blockade. Thus, our study provides new insights                    into the regulation of CD8+ T cell responses demonstrating an implication                    of the costimulatory molecule 2B4.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the causative agent of acute chronic hepatitis C infection. HCV-specific CD8+ T cells are the most prevalent target of HCV infection, but the function of these cells is not well understood. In this study, we show that 2B4, an intracellular adaptor molecule, is expressed in CD8 + T cells and is involved in the regulation of viral cell function. We also show that twoB4 expression levels are regulated by two other factors, namely, 2B1 and 2B2, which regulate the expression levels of the virus-specific receptor SAP. Our results suggest that the two molecules are involved in regulating CD8-T cell function in acute chronic hepatocellular infection."

For many viruses, host species-specific difference in viral entry receptors presents a major hurdle for cross-species transmission. Poxviruses, however, can enter nearly any animal cell. Why many poxviruses show strict host species specificity and what it would take for them to jump to new hosts are less clear. Here, we present data suggesting that SAMD9 and its paralog, SAMD9L, constitute a critical host barrier against poxvirus infection and pathogenesis. We also discovered some host species-specific difference in SAMD9/SAMD9L and some poxvirus-specific difference in antagonizing SAMD9/SAMD9L, suggesting that these differences serve as a barrier for cross-species poxvirus infection. The knowledge is fundamental for understanding the determinants of poxvirus host-range.","Vaccinia virus (VACV) and K1 C7 are two major poxviruses that cause disease in humans and animals. In mammals, the virus is able to replicate in a wide range of host tissues, including ruminants. However, the host-specific differences in the SAMD9/SAMD9L genes are not well understood. In this study, we show that the human SAMD 9, a tumor suppressor restriction factor, antagonizes two classes of poxvirus proteins, the vaccinia virus K1 and C7. In contrast, the mammalian SAMD8, a protein that is encoded by the virus, functions similarly in mammals, and is a critical host barrier against poxiruses to overcome establish infection. In mice, we find that the virus can overcome the restriction of the virus by inhibiting the virus's replication and pathogenesis. In addition, we demonstrate that the S.AMD9 and S.M.L restriction factors are able to overcome the virus’s restriction of K1, C7, and the K1-C7 homologs in diverse mammalian poxiviruses, indicating that the host species-specific difference in the two genes serves as a barrier to cross-species poxirus transmission."

Despite causing significant morbidity, effective vaccines or therapeutic agents to protect humans against many flaviviruses are lacking. Because of the importance of antibodies in flavivirus immunity and vaccine protection, much effort is focused on understanding the factors that modulate antibody recognition of flaviviruses. Virus breathing, which allows viruses to sample different conformations at equilibrium, has the potential to transiently expose otherwise inaccessible antibody epitopes. Here, we report the identification a single mutation in the envelope protein that alters the exposure of a poorly accessible epitope and the stability of both WNV and DENV through changes in the ensemble of structures sampled by the virus. For WNV, this change attenuated infection and pathogenesis in mice, suggesting that virus conformational dynamics have relevant consequences in vivo.","West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the most widely distributed flaviviruses. It is the only flavivirus that is able to survive in the environment. However, the molecular basis of the functional consequences of WNV’s breathing is poorly understood.

The T198F mutation resulted in a ~70-fold increase in sensitivity to neutralization of monoclonal antibody targeting the cryptic epitope of the fusion loop. Increased exposure to the poorly accessible fusion loop epitope accompanied reduced virus stability and solution at physiological temperatures. Introduction of a mutation analogous to that of dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Zika virus resulted in increased accessibility of the cryptic fusion loop to the epitope and decreased virus stability in the solution.

Since the clinical presentations of melioidosis are extremely variable and no specific signs or symptoms exist, early laboratory-based diagnosis is highly desirable to start appropriate antibiotics. Routine methods for culture detection of B. pseudomallei are highly specific but take several days for a result, and depending on the clinical sample and other factors, sensitivity can be low. The standard serology test for melioidosis is an indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) based on crude B. pseudomallei antigen preparations. Due to the variable prevalence of background seropositivity in endemic areas and the low diagnostic sensitivity of the IHA upon admission, the test is currently not recommended for the diagnosis of melioidosis, but still widely used. Thus, we generated a protein array containing 20 B. pseudomallei antigens previously shown to have serodiagnostic potential. Our array allows highly specific and sensitive antibody recognition in blood sera and plasmas from patients with melioidosis. The standardized microarray device is simple to use and fast, and is thus applicable in a routine diagnostic laboratory. In this study, the multiplex testing of antibodies in melioidosis sera from different time points after admission allowed the detection of short- and long-term antibodies to various antigens. Further studies will examine the potential role of those antibodies to discriminate different stages of the disease. Furthermore, the protein microarray might be useful in studies aimed at elucidating the exposure of humans and animals to B. pseudomallei in different parts of the world.","Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei that causes a high case-fatality rate in tropical and subtropical regions.

When transmitted to humans it causes Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) a major public health problem. T. cruzi is genetically diverse and currently split into six groups, known as TcI to TcVI. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a method used for studying the population structure and diversity of pathogens and involves sequencing DNA of several different genes and comparing the sequences between isolates. Here, we assess 13 T. cruzi genes and select the best combination for diversity studies. Outputs reveal that a combination of 7 genes can be used for both lineage assignment and high resolution studies of genetic diversity, and a reduced combination of four loci for lineage assignment. Application of MLST for assigning field isolates of T. cruzi to genetic groups and for detailed investigation of diversity provides a valuable approach to understanding the taxonomy, population structure, genetics, ecology and epidemiology of this important human pathogen.","Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease, possesses extensive genetic diversity. This has led to the development of a plethora of molecular typing methods for the identification of known major genetic lineages and fine scale characterization of different multilocus genotypes of major lineages. However, the current gold standard for T. cruzi typing, which relies on large sample sizes, is currently not available. In this work, we present an optimized Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme, based on combined analysis of recently proposed MLST approaches. The MLST scheme consisted of thirteen concatenated gene fragments applied to a panel of T.cruzi reference strains encompassing known genetic linesages. Concatenation of 13 fragments allowed assignment of strains predicted for Discrete Typing Units (DTUs), near-clades, with the exception of a strain outlier of TcV, which had an apparent loss of heterozygosity in the fragment. Monophyly DTUs, robust bootstrap support, restored the fragment, and the fragment was subsequently excluded from analysis. The optimal combination consisted of 7 loci that discriminated from the reference strains panel, majority of which supported robust bootstra values. Additionally, reduced panel 4 gene fragments displayed high bootstrap values and DTU assignment discriminated from 21 of 25 genotypes. Our results suggest that a seven- fragment MLST system is the gold standard of all types of gene typing, particularly single locus approaches and systematic PCR assays based on amplicon size."

The genes that regulate development of sex-specific traits may therefore represent novel targets for mosquito control. Here, we examine the effects of silencing the sex-determination gene doublesex (dsx) during development of the human disease vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Targeting of dsx resulted in decreased length of the female wing and proboscis, ovary and reproductive defects, and disruption of olfactory system development. Female lifespan, a critical aspect of mosquito pathogen transmission, was also significantly reduced in adult females following developmental targeting of dsx. The results of this investigation demonstrate that silencing of dsx during A. aegypti development disrupts multiple sex-specific morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits of adult females, a number of which are directly or indirectly linked to mosquito reproduction and pathogen transmission. The results obtained also connect Dsx to development of the mosquito olfactory system, suggesting that A. aegypti will be an excellent system in which to further assess the developmental genetics of sex-specific chemosensation.","Sex-specific traits, including female-specific ability to bite humans and vector disease, are critical for mosquito reproduction and pathogen transmission. Doublesex (Dsx), a terminal transcription factor of the sex determination pathway, is known to regulate sex-specific gene expression in development of the dengue fever vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. However, the effects of developmental siRNA-mediated dsx silencing on development of adult females have not been assessed in adult females. We found that Dsx-mediated silencing resulted in decreased female wing size, which correlate with body size, typically larger females than larger females. Furthermore, dsX silencing negatively impacted female membrane blood feeding and mating behavior in the laboratory, and decreased fecundity and fertility correlated with decreased ovary length, ovariole length, and ovaryle number. These findings suggest that dsox silencing may be an excellent system to assess developmental genetics and sex-related chemosensation."

Here, we found that the specific interaction between viral nucleocapsid protein and vector sugar transporter 6 of Laodelphax striatellus (LsST6) determines whether the virus can invade midgut epithelial cells or not. These results provide direct evidence that LsST6 is an essential and key factor in crossing the midgut infection barrier for viruses, especially for RSV.

Due to the striking genetic monomorphism of African M. ulcerans populations, conventional genetic fingerprinting methods have largely failed to differentiate isolates coming from the same BU endemic area. Here we report a highly discriminatory fingerprinting method for M. ulcerans using a single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic fine-typing technique. This method has enabled us for the first time to identify different M. ulcerans haplotypes within a BU endemic area. Linking the origins of M. ulcerans strains with the patients' residences unveiled the clustering of unique M. ulcerans haplotypes within the Densu river basin of Ghana.

We describe a quorum sensing mediated by the release of aromatic alcohols in the growth medium that blocks hyphal development in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus. This is the first description of such a mechanism in the fission yeast lineage, and confirms its expansion along Ascomycota fungi. The stress-responsive pathway (SAPK), which regulates fungal growth and differentiation, limits hyphal growth in S. japonicus in a constitutive fashion, and nonfunctional SAPK mutants are partially insensitive to quorum sensing and able to form hyphae in high cell density cultures. Nrg1, an important factor that blocks hyphal development in the pathogen Candida albicans, activates hyphal growth in S. japonicus, and its expression is counteracted by both quorum sensing and the SAPK pathway. Nrg1 function may thus have diverged evolutionary in this organism from being a repressor to an activator of hyphal development.

QS is a simple eukaryotic response mediated by the release of growth medium quorum-sensing molecules (SMs) whose concentration increases proportionally with population density. To date, the occurrence of QS has restricted to yeast species. Here we show that QS mediated by aromatic alcohols and phenylethanol tryptophol represses dimorphic yeast hypha differentiation in fission yeast S. japonicus. In addition, the stress activated MAPK pathway (SAPK) controls cell cycle progression and adaptation to environmental changes in the organism, constitutively represses yeast hyphal differentiation at transcriptional and post-translational levels. Furthermore, deletion of the main effectors of the Sty1 MAPK Atf1 transcription factor partially suppressed QS-dependent block of hyphal development inducing conditions in C. albicans. We show that the expression of nrg1+, encodes a putative ortholog of the transcription factor Nrg1, represses hypha dimorphism in yeast and C. lumen.

Here we assess the effects of virus infections on pain sensitivity in mice. Infecting mice with two different viruses, influenza and mouse leukemia virus (MuLV) increased pain sensitivity. Influenza infection caused transient increase in pain sensitivity, which returned to normal levels after infections were cleared. However persistent MuLV infections caused sustained increase in pain sensitivity. Virus-induced pain sensitivity was reduced substantially in mice lacking the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), which degrades the amino acid tryptophan. Moreover a natural compound produced by cells expressing IDO enhanced pain sensitivity when administered to mice lacking IDO genes. Thus cells expressing IDO caused increased pain sensitivity in infected mice. A distinctive cell type expressed IDO selectively and accumulated in spleens of MuLV-infected mice. Transfer of spleen cells from MuLV-infected mice caused increased pain sensitivity in uninfected mice while eliminating specific cells in MuLV-infected mice abolished enhanced pain sensitivity. Our findings show that host immune responses to virus infections cause increased pain sensitivity and suggest novel ways to alleviate pain during infections.","Acute acute influenza virus (IAV) and chronic murine leukemia retrovirus (MuLV) infections are associated with chronic pain hypersensitivity. However, the underlying causes of this hypersensitivity are poorly understood. Here, we show that chronic pain sensitivity in rodents is linked to enhanced tryptophan catabolism in the brain mediated by indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO). In mice lacking IDO1 genes, we found that MuLV infection stimulated robust IDO expression in the lungs and lymphoid tissues, and induced acute chronic pain and hypersensitivity, respectively. In contrast, virus-induced pain and sensitivity manifest in mice lacking intact IDO genes. Spleen IDO activity increased markedly in infected mice as MuLV infections progressed, and IDO 1 expression was elevated significantly in brain and spinal cord (CNS) tissues. In addition, kynurenine (Kyn) cells expressing IDO, which are important mediators of CD19 and dendritic cell (CD11c) markers, induced enhanced pain in uninfected mice. These findings support the hypothesis that elevated IDO levels in CD19+ DCs may enhance pain sensitivity mediated by Kyn."

There are no vaccines or effective treatment, especially in the chronic phase when most patients are diagnosed, which makes a strong case for the development of new drugs to treat the disease. In this work we evaluate a family of proteins called Ecto-Nucleoside-Triphosphate-Diphosphohydrolase (Ecto-NTPDase) as new chemotherapy target to block T. cruzi infection in mammalian cells and in mice. We have used inhibitors and antibodies against this protein and demonstrated that T. cruzi Ecto-NTPDases act as facilitators of infection in mammalian cells and virulence factors in mice model.

In this study, we evaluated the influence of Ecto-Nucleoside-Triphosphate-Diphosphohydrolase (Ecto)-NTPDase) activity on infectivity and virulence of T. cruzi in vivo in vitro models. We found that Ectoside/NTPDases are active in the infective process of trypomastigotes, and that they are involved in the infection of mammalian cells. In addition, we found that the activity of the ECTo-NTPDASE inhibitor ARL 67156, Gadolinium Suramin, and anti-ATPDase-1 polyclonal antiserum ATPase and ADPase hydrolytic activities were significantly reduced in the infected cells.

Since traditional vaccine design efforts have had limited success, much effort in recent years has focused on gaining a better understanding of the ways select individuals are able to effectively neutralize the virus upon natural infection, and to utilize that knowledge for the design of optimized vaccine candidates. Primary emphasis has been placed on characterizing the antibody arm of the immune system, and specifically on antibodies capable of neutralizing the majority of circulating HIV-1 strains. Various experimental techniques can be applied to map the epitope targets of these antibodies, but more recently, the development of computational methods has provided an efficient and accurate alternative for understanding the complex antibody responses to HIV-1 in a given individual. Here, we present the next generation of this computational technology, and show that these new methods have significantly improved accuracy and confidence, and that they enable the interrogation of biologically important questions that can lead to new insights for the design of an effective vaccine against HIV-1.","Computational neutralization fingerprinting, NFP, is an efficient and accurate method for predicting epitope specificities and polyclonal antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the present-generation NFP algorithms substantially improve the prediction accuracy of individual donors and enable serologic analysis of entire cohorts. Specifically, we developed three algorithms: (a) selection of optimized virus neutralization panels for NFP analysis, (b) estimation of NFP prediction confidence confidence in the serum sample, and (c) identification of sera with potentially novel epitopes specificities. At the individual donor level, the new algorithms were particularly improved in their ability to detect multiple epitopes in the sample, confirmed by computationally simulated polyclon sera samples from HIV-infected donors. Specifically the new algorithm detected multiple specificities twice in the simulated sera, and was able to detect previously confirmed antibody specificities, VRC01-like and PG9-like, in the donor CHAVI 0219. Overall, the analysis of ~150 broadly neutralizing HIV- infected donor samples suggested a potential connection between clade infection types elicited by epitope-specific antibodies."

Typhimurium gastrointestinal tract .","Bacteria belonging to the genus Salmonella are capable of causing long-term chronic systemic infections in specific hosts where they are shed in the feces. These persistently infected individuals include typhoid carriers and they serve as a reservoir for disease transmission. Despite the importance of Salmonella as a human pathogen, relatively little is known about the host immune response to persistent bacterial infections in the context of transmission. We had shown previously in a mouse model of Salmonella infection that mice shedding high levels of Salmonella (>108 bacteria per gram of feces), known as super-shedders, transmit disease to naïve mice. We show here that these super-shedder mice have a unique immune state compared to mice that have lower levels of Salmonella in their gut. The super-shedder immune state is characterized by an active inflammatory immune response with elevated serum IL-6 and high levels of neutrophils in both the gastrointestinal tract and the systemic sites but a dampened adaptive CD4 T helper type1 (TH1) cell response specific to the spleen. Importantly, we show that the blunted adaptive response, as characterized by reduced TH1 cell frequencies and ability to respond to IL-2 and IL-6, is intimately linked to the levels of neutrophils present in the spleen. We go on to show the functional consequences of dampened cytokine responsiveness, as TH1 cells from moderate-shedders are unable to undergo IL-2-mediated expansion when neutrophilia is induced. Additionally, we show that neutrophil control of IL-2 mediated expansion of TH1 cells is independent of infection. In summary, we describe an immune phenotype associated with transmission of a pathogen and a single immune cell type, neutrophils, which control specific aspects of the super-shedder immune state.","Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an important cause of disease in humans and animal hosts. The host-to-host transmission pathogen ensures successful propagation and maintenance of the host population. The striking feature of disease transmission heterogeneity is the heterogeneity of host infectiousness. In the proposed host population, 20% of infected hosts, termed super-shedders, are responsible for 80% of the disease transmission. However, little is known about the immune state of super-hedders. In this study, we used a model organism of Salmonella, a major cause of human disease in animal hosts, to study the immune response of the super-shedder mice. We found that the active inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract and spleen dampened the TH1 response in specific secondary lymphoid organs. Furthermore, G-CSF-treated mice had higher numbers of neutrophils, a dampened T cell response, characterized by higher levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs), fewer T-bet+ (TH1) T cells and blunted cytokine responsiveness. These results demonstrate a novel role for neutrophil in blunting IL-2-mediated proliferation of the TH2 immune response in spleens."

It is caused by mutations in the EPM2A or EPM2B genes encoding the laforin carbohydrate-binding phosphatase and the malin E3 ubiquitin ligase. LD is the most common neurodegenerative epilepsy of adolescents. Affected children suffer an ordeal lasting 10 years, consisting of escalating seizures, constant body jerking, particularly frightening epileptic visual hallucinations, and later on dementia. They die of massive convulsion. Brain biopsies reveal accumulation of a starch-like compound, polyglucosan, overtaking dendrites and likely causing the disease, and neurodegeneration. Glycogen synthase (GS), the enzyme that forms normal glycogen, is also responsible for synthesizing these polyglucosans. We reasoned that reducing GS activity might prevent polyglucosan formation. Mice deficient of Epm2a replicate LD and are a standard model. Members of our group generated mice deficient of PTG, a protein involved in activating GS. By breeding LD mice with PTG-lacking mice, we generated LD mice lacking the GS-activating effect of PTG. This resulted in a cure. The double knockout mice have almost no polyglucosan, no neurodegeneration, and no seizures. Our work opens an avenue of treatment for this fatal epilepsy, which may also be applicable to other glycogen storage diseases.","Myoclonus epilepsy (PME) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a starch-like compound, polyglucosan, that accumulates in neuronal cell bodies and overtakes neuronal small processes, mainly dendrites. Polyglucosean formation is catalyzed by the glycogen synthase, which is activated by dephosphorylation of glycogen-associated protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). We show that the near-complete disappearance of polylucosans in mice with myoclonic epilepsy results in a near complete disappearance of the polyglocosan and resolution of myoclonus epilepsy. Our work discloses an entryway for treating fatal epilepsy and potentially glycogen storage diseases."

Serologic measures of Ct may provide additional information about exposure and transmission patterns. Here, we evaluated the relationship between serologic markers of Ct, infection, and TF at the individual and community levels to evaluate the utility of serology for measuring trachoma in a mesoendemic region of Niger.

These discoveries hold tremendous potential for totally new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. To realize this potential, one important step is to understand the function of the thousands of proteins whose function is currently unknown. One of these proteins of unknown function is human DJ-1, a protein that appears to play a protective role against Parkinson and other neurodegenerative diseases. Here we present a computational approach to the classification by function of DJ-1 and its family members. Eight DJ-1 family members, all with similar 3-D structure, are analyzed. Three different probable functional classes emerge from this analysis on six of the family members, all with a simple calculation.","Proteins in the DJ-1 family are known to have many functional classes. However, their sequence and/or 3-D structure have not been determined. Functional assignment of sequence relationships is misleading, because structural similarity does not necessarily imply functional similarity. Proteins from the DJ family, known for their unknown function, are examples of proteins with sequence and fold similarity that span multiple functional classes and are available in three-dimensional structures. TheMATICS ( theoretical microscopic titration curves) is an electrostatics-based computational approach to functional site prediction, which sort proteins from different functional classes based on their structural alignment. Active site residues are predicted to be distinct from those predicted for different functional groups. Placement of predicted residues on the structural alignment of proteins reveals distinct types of active sites. The type of residues overlaps partially, but the residue common to the predicted residues belongs to a probable functional group. In this study, we show that proteins predicted for active sites have dimer interfaces, and that the predicted sites are contained in a subunit. The MATICS predicts a set of residues that are typical for the cysteine protease Protease; the prediction of PfpI/YhbO bears similarity with the predicted proteins. The computational prediction of functional sites in protein structures with unknown function provides valuable clues for functional classification."

Here, we report that NS3 protein encoded by Rice stripe virus (RSV) regulates the processing of several primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by acting as an intermediary to modulate the association of pri-miRNAs and OsDRB1, a key factor of the pri-miRNA processing complex. NS3 increases recruitment of pri-miRNA to the processing complex by its association with OsDRB1 at the sites required for OsDRB1 dimer formation and induces several miRNAs accumulations as well as target genes repression, promoting the sensitivity of rice to RSV infection.

Surprisingly, we do not understand precisely how these memory cells work: in what way are they better than non-memory (“naïve”) cells, and how do they exert their life-saving functions? It was thought that, following exposure to the relevant microbial antigen, memory cells responded by increasing in number much more quickly than naïve cells and that they achieved this greater abundance by two means: first, by initiating cell division sooner after infection; and, second, by multiplying more rapidly thereafter. Here, we show that neither is true. Memory cells, like naïve cells, begin to divide only after lengthy (2–3 day) delay after virus infection, and their subsequent rate of division is no faster than that of naïve cells. We speculate on the possible evolutionary benefits that might accrue from this lengthy delay before cell division begins.","T cell memory is the cornerstone of protective immunity, a key element in successful vaccination. However, when encountering a relevant pathogen, memory T cells are thought to initiate cell division more rapidly than their naïve counterparts, which is thought to confer a significant biological advantage to the immune host. Here, we use traceable TCR-transgenic T cells to evaluate the proposed characteristic of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We find that in the presence of an abundant antigen sufficient to induce in vivo IFNγ production of memory cells, memory naïve T cells extended, indistinguishable, the delay in onset of proliferation. Moreover, memory cells were able to detect, respond, and respond to virus infection within hours, and proliferation did not begin ∼3 days after infection, but occurred simultaneously in anatomical compartments. Thus, cell division was extraordinarily rapid in naïve memory cells compared to memory naïve cells, showing somewhat accelerated accumulation. We propose that by permitting memory cells to rapidly exert effector functions in delaying onset and proliferation, evolution provided a safeguard against the risk of infection and the consequences of severe T cell–mediated immunopathology."

Here, we report that hyperthermia (39.5°C) boosts HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells. In single-cycle infection experiments, hyperthermia increased HIV-1 infection up to 7-fold. This effect was mediated in part by an increased activation of the HIV-1 promoter by the viral protein Tat. Our results also indicate that hyperthermia may help HIV-1 to reactivate from latency. We also show that the Heat Shock Protein Hsp90, which levels are increased at 39.5°C, mediates in a large part the positive effect of hyperthermia on HIV-1 infection.

Thus, alternate therapeutic interventions are needed in the absence of vaccines and mounting drug resistance. VL is also characterized by severe depression of cell-mediated immunity that complicates the efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs. Restoration of the dampened immune system coupled with antileishmanial effect would be a rational approach in the quest for antileishmanial drugs.

The peptidoglycan hydrolases responsible for this cleavage often have redundant functions, both revealing their importance and making them difficult to study. Furthermore, such hydrolases must be tightly regulated, due to their potentially lytic nature. We recently demonstrated the interaction between a lytic transglycosylase (Rpf) and an endopeptidase (RipA) at the septum of dividing bacteria. To investigate the role of these two hydrolases, we generated conditional mutants of each and were surprised to find that depletion of ripA resulted in long chains of cells. This phenotype was reversed upon induction of ripA, indicating that cell wall expansion and septum formation can be decoupled from the process of septum resolution. In addition, we present data showing that the combination of Rpf and RipA results in enhanced hydrolysis of peptidoglycan in an in vitro assay, suggesting protein–protein interactions as one potential mechanism of regulation.","The final stage of bacterial cell division requires the activity of enzymes capable of degrading layers of the peptidoglycan connecting recently developed daughter cells. This is a key step in cell division, but little is known about how these enzymes are regulated. In this study, we investigated the role of two lytic transglycosylases mycobacteria, known as resuscitation-promoting factor B E (RpfB and RpfE) and RipA. We found that RipA is a hydrolytic endopeptidase that is required for the cell wall-targeting of β-lactams. In addition, we found that ripA was required for viability and morphology of M. smegmatis. We also found that the ripA-like orthologue was functionally complemented by M. tuberculosis ripA orthologue (rv1477) and ripA, ripA's-like Orthologue ( rv1478). Depletion of ripA resulted in increased susceptibility to cell wall–targeting β-Lactams and increased susceptibility of cell wall substrates. These data reveal an unusual essentiality of a peptidophosphate hydrolase and suggest a novel protein–protein interaction as a way of regulating activity."

We developed an efficient method for calculating the expected distribution of genetic variation, given a demographic model including such events as population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration. We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.","Genetic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events by serving as null models of genome scans and selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants in populations. We numerically compute the expected spectrum of diffusion in a composite likelihood scheme, where linkage neutral loci alters the variance and the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties and the significance values of hypothesis tests. Our method incorporate selection into single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles in populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, admixture, and admixture. We estimate the divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95% confidence interval: 40–270 kya) and the divergence of European and East Asian (CHB) populations at 23 kya. Our analysis yields evidence of subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with previously estimated distribution of selective effects of newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency of nonsynonymous variants in continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU)."

While humans have lost most facial hair, eyebrows are a notable exception. Eyebrow thickness is heritable and widely believed to be subject to sexual selection. Nevertheless, few genomic studies have explored its genetic basis. Here we performed genome-wide association studies for eyebrow thickness in multiple ethnic groups, including Han Chinese, Uyghurs, Latin Americans, and Caucasians. We found solid evidence that novel genetic variants near the SOX2, FOXD1 and EDAR genes could affect eyebrow thickness. After fine mapping, we prioritized four variants for experimental verification. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing provided evidence that the variants rs1345417 and rs12651896 affect the transcriptional activity of the nearby SOX2 and FOXD1 genes. This represents a successful example of a combination of GWAS and CRISPR/Cas9 technology to demonstrate how non-coding variants with regulatory functions may play an important role in common diseases and traits. Finally, suitable statistical analyses suggest that, contrary to popular speculation, eyebrow thickness should not be subject to strong selection pressure, including sexual selection.","Hair plays an important role in primates and is clearly subject to adaptive selection.

Furthermore , relatively high occurrence fenbendazole sulphone suggests higher detoxifying capacity T. suis compared O. dentatum .","The human whipworm Trichuris trichiura is together with the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides and the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator Americanus the most common intestinal worms worldwide. Together they place more than 5 billion people at risk of infection. The current global control strategy against these worms is regular administration of anthelmintic drugs, mostly albendazole and mebendazole, both belonging to the drug-class benzimidazoles. Both drugs have a low effect against T. trichiura infections, but the reasons for this are not known. We evaluated the in vitro effect of two benzimidazoles; i.e., albendazole, fenbendazole, and another type of anthelmintic, levamisole, on the whipworm (T. suis) and the nodular worm (Oesophagostomum dentatum) of the pig. Oesophagostomum dentatum is highly sensitive towards benzimidazoles in comparison to T. suis. We measured and compared the drug uptake in both species in both living and killed worms. Our results suggest that the reason for the difference in sensitivity is due to a lower drug uptake into T. suis as compared to O. dentatum. Furthermore, T. suis was able to metabolise fenbendazole into an inactive metabolite to a much larger extent than O. dentatum, suggesting a higher detoxifying capacity of T. suis as compared to O. dentatum.","Trichuris trichiura infections are the most common parasitic infections in humans.

We measured the concentrations of the parent drug compounds metabolites of the metabolites in the drug compounds of the worms compared to the species maximum specific binding capacity (Bmax) of the drugs. We found that the drug uptake was significantly lower in the two species compared to those of the tested drugs. Furthermore, we found that drug uptake in living and killed worms was significantly decreased in the species incubated with benzimidemidazoles, and decreased in those incubated in the presence of the benzimisole. These results suggest that the general lower sensitivity of the two drugs in vitro is related to lower drug uptake."

Therapies targeting the pathogenic lifestyle of NTHI remain non-existent due to a lack of understanding of host microenvironmental cues and bacterial responses that dictate NTHI persistence. Iron availability influences bacterial virulence traits and biofilm formation; yet, host sequestration of iron serves to restrict bacterial growth. We predicted that fluctuations in availability of iron-containing compounds, typically associated with infection, would impact NTHI pathogenesis. We demonstrated that transient restriction of heme-iron triggered an epigenetic developmental program that enhanced NTHI biofilm architecture, directly influenced by induced morphological changes in bacterial length. Heme-iron restricted bacteria were primed for survival in the mammalian middle ear, due in part to an observed reduction in host inflammation coinciding with a striking reduction in host mucosal epithelial damage, compared to that observed in response to heme-iron replete NTHI. Moreover, transiently restricted NTHI were more invasive of epithelial cells resulting in formation of intracellular bacterial communities. Our findings significantly advance our understanding of how host immune pressure and nutrient availability influence pathogenic behaviors that impact disease severity.","In order to suppress microbial outgrowth, the host sequesters essential nutrients through a process termed nutritional immunity. However, inflammatory responses to bacterial insult can restore nutritional resources. Given that nutrient availability modulates the virulence factor production of biofilm formation in bacterial species, it is hypothesized that fluctuations in heme-iron availability, particularly at privileged sites, may similarly influence Haemophilus biofilm development and pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that heme–iron restriction can promote biofilm growth and persistence in the presence of a variety of pathogenic phenotypes. We show that prior heme iron restriction potentiates biofilm changes that include increased peak height and architectural complexity compared to biofilms initiated by heme and replete bacteria, suggesting a mechanism by which epigenetic responses participate in the changes observed. Additionally, we show that in a co-infection model of human otitis media, we found that when heme was restricted to Haemphilus, accounting for 10% of the inoculum (90% heme-, replete) and represented 99% of organisms recovered within 4 days. Taken together, these data suggest that nutritional immunity, in fact, can foster long-term phenotypic changes that better equip bacteria for survival at infectious sites."

Thus, control of dengue fever still relies mostly on controlling its mosquito vectors. Large amounts of entomological, epidemiological and clinical data are generated; these need to be efficiently organized in order to further our comprehension of the disease and its control. IDODEN aims to cover the different aspects and intricacies of dengue fever and syndromes caused by dengue virus(es). It contains more than 5000 terms describing epidemiological data, vaccine development, clinical features, the disease course, and more. We show here that it can be a helpful tool for researchers and that, in addition to allowing sophisticated search strategies, it is also useful for tasks such as modeling.","Dengue fever is one of the most important vector-borne diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. It is a major public health problem in the developing world, affecting millions of people worldwide. In order to reduce the burden of dengue, there is a need to expand the toolbox available for control and prevention of vector- borne diseases. This is achieved by the construction of specific ontologies. We present IDODEN, an open source software, which describes the aspects of this disease in an ontology that is modeled on IDOMAL, a malaria ontology developed previously. We constructed the software to be freely available, and it covers all aspects of the disease, including the disease biology, epidemiology, and clinical features. Furthermore, we used it to facilitate the annotation and annotation of the data, in addition to the use of modeling, and utilized it to build dedicated tools for decision support systems. The availability of the denguing ontology will enable databases hosting dengues-associated data and decision-support systems for the disease to perform efficiently and link data stored in independent repositories, in an architecture- and software-independent manner."
