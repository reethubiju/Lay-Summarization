In this scenario, unrelated genes can convergently evolve to produce proteins with the same molecular function, termed “functionally analogous.” A quantitative determination of the reaction similarities among functionally analogous enzymes could provide insight about the different structural solutions nature has used to evolve similar catalysts. Bond changes between substrates and products, and between successive reaction intermediates, were used to compare the reactions catalyzed and the mechanisms of catalysis for 95 pairs of functionally analogous enzymes. Less than half of the reactions catalyzed by unrelated enzymes, but defined as similar by the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification, are similar in terms of bond changes, suggesting that this classification often fails to capture quantitative differences between many enzyme reactions. Furthermore, we addressed for the first time whether the chemical mechanisms by which similar overall reactions are achieved in functional analogs are also similar. We conclude that convergence of reaction is often accompanied by convergence of chemical mechanism. These results will be useful for classifying enzymes, guiding functional annotation of newly determined enzyme sequences and structures and for informing the engineering of enzymes with new functions."

The surveillance rate has been estimated previously using combinations of modeling and experiment, making the assumption that CTL and target cells are well-mixed and that all cell types are killed with equal efficiency. In this study we take an iterative approach with theory and experiment to go beyond such models and detail the effects of cellular heterogeneity, the spatial organisation of the tissue within which killing is taking place, and the influence of the level of expression of peptides on the target cell surface. We demonstrate that determining the degree of co-localisation of effector and target cells, and the level of peptide expression on targets, are most important for improving estimates of CTL killing rates. Further, while the probabilities of killing upon conjugation of CTL with T and B cell targets are similar, T cells take substantially longer to kill than B cells, an effect that may be important when CTL numbers are limiting."

In mammals, this dosage imbalance is adjusted by doubling expression of X-linked genes in both sexes and by silencing one X chromosome in females. We used expression array analyses of human triploid cultures to test X chromosome expression in the presence of three sets of autosomes and address the question of an autosomal counting factor. We found that overall X-linked gene expression is not tripled in the presence of three sets of autosomes. However, in triploid cells with a single active X chromosome, its expression is adjusted upward presumably by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the active X/autosome ratio. Based on the range of individual gene expression we identified a subset of dosage-sensitive genes whose expression is apparently proportional to the ploidy. Our findings are important for understanding the regulation of the X chromosome and the role of ploidy in the balance of gene expression and associated phenotypes."

The pig roundworm A. suum is a good model for A. lumbricoides infection in humans due to similar host physiology and the close genetic relationship between the worms. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize early larval antigens that are targeted by antibodies at the level of the intestine in immune pigs and to evaluate their protective and diagnostic potential. In order to do so, we generated highly immune pigs by repeatedly infecting them with A. suum for a long time (32 weeks). After necropsy, locally harvested antibodies from the gut were used to screen larval extracts. Hereby one particular antigen, named As12, was detected. It was characterized as a molecule of glycolipid nature that is presented on, and actively secreted from, the surface of infective larvae. Pigs immunized with this antigen are not protected from subsequent challenge infection. Experimentally infected pigs or naturally infected humans do however mount a significant serological antibody response to the antigen. These findings shed light on a glycolipid-like antigen (As12) that is secreted by infectious Ascaris larvae and is targeted by the immune system of infected humans and pigs."

The cases, presenting over a 3-week period, were characterized by abrupt disease onset, high fever, bloody vomiting and diarrhea, and, in two patients, death within 3 days. BASV was present in the blood of the lone survivor at a concentration of over a million copies per milliliter. The genome of BASV, assembled from over 140 million sequence reads, reveals that it is very different from any other rhabdovirus. The lone survivor and a nurse caring for him (with no symptoms), both health care workers, were found to have high levels of antibodies to BASV, indicating that they both had been infected by the virus. Although the source of the virus remains unclear, our study findings suggest that BASV may be spread by human-to-human contact and is an emerging pathogen associated with acute hemorrhagic fever in Africa."

Altogether , data reveal differential splicing previously uncharacterized mode translational control hypoxia supported model hypoxia - induced changes cotranscriptional processing lead selective retention PTC - containing intron EIF2B5 .","Tumor hypoxia is a negative prognostic factor for many solid cancers. Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is largely mediated by widespread changes in gene expression and enables cancer cells to adjust and survive. Recently, alternative splicing has been implicated in this process. To identify biologically impactful hypoxia-responsive isoforms, we took an unbiased approach to deeply sequence RNA of normoxic and hypoxic head and neck cancer cells. This analysis identified >1,000 mRNAs as alternatively spliced under hypoxia, including a significant enrichment of alternatively spliced genes involved in adaptation to hypoxia. Most notably, we discovered a unique retained intron in the translation initiation factor EIF2B5 that creates a premature termination codon. We show that this retained intron leads to a 65kDa truncated isoform that opposes full-length eIF2Bε to inhibit global translation and enhances survival of head and neck cancer cells under hypoxia. Strikingly, this intron and several additional hypoxia-induced retained introns were overexpressed in solid tumors relative to normal tissues. Mechanistically, we propose that intron retention under hypoxia is influenced by changes to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity at weak 3′ splice sites and carry out experimental validation for the retained intron in EIF2B5 to investigate intron retention under hypoxia."

In humans, the goal of significantly reducing already-established plaque through drug treatments, including statins, remains elusive. In mice, atherosclerosis can be reversed by experimental manipulations that lower circulating lipid levels. A common feature of many regression models is that macrophages transition to a less inflammatory state and emigrate from the plaque. While the molecular regulators that control these responses are largely unknown, we hypothesized that by integrating global measurements of macrophage gene expression in regressing plaques with measurements of the macrophage chromatin landscape, we could identify key molecules that control macrophage responses to the lowering of circulating lipid levels. Our systems biology analysis of plaque macrophages yielded a network in which the Wnt signaling pathway emerged as a candidate upstream regulator. Wnt signaling is known to affect both inflammation and the ability of macrophages to migrate from one location to another, and our targeted validation studies provide evidence that Wnt signaling is increased in plaque macrophages during regression. Our findings both demonstrate the power of a systems approach to uncover candidate regulators of regression and to identify a potential new therapeutic target."

In vertebrates, hematopoietic development occurs in two phases: a transitory embryonic, or primitive, wave produces only erythrocytes (red blood cells) and myeloid cells; an adult, or definitive, wave gives rise to at least three blood cell lineages, including erythrocytes and two types of immune cells—myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Previous studies have shown that the stem-cell leukemia (SCL) gene is essential for hematopoietic stem cell specification and erythrocyte maturation. Yet how SCL regulates these distinct processes is not fully understood. This study demonstrates that zebrafish produce a smaller isoform of scl, scl-β, that plays an overlapping role with the full-length scl-α in the initiation of primitive hematopoiesis, but possesses distinct functions in regulating primitive erythrocyte maturation and definitive hematopoietic stem cell development. We further show that the distinct functions of scl-α and -β are likely due to differences in their protein expression level through the regulation of protein stability. We postulate that hematopoietic cell development at different levels of hierarchy is governed by a gradient of the Scl protein created by temporal and spatial expression of different scl isoforms."

The canonical DNA replication machinery is unable to fully replicate DNA at chromosome ends, causing telomeres to shorten with every round of cell division. This shortening can be counteracted by an enzyme called telomerase, but in most human somatic cells, there is insufficient expression of telomerase to prevent telomere shortening. Cells with critically short telomeres can enter an arrested state known as senescence. Telomere attrition has been identified as a hallmark of human ageing. Homologous recombination proteins are important for proper telomere function in yeast and mammals. Yeast lacking both telomerase and Rad52, required for almost all recombination, exhibits accelerated senescence, yet no apparent increase in the rate of telomere shortening. In this study, we explore the role of Rad52 during senescence by taking advantage of rad52 separation-of-function mutants. We find that Rad52 acts in multiple ways to overcome DNA replication problems at telomeres. Impediments to telomere replication can be dealt with by post-replication repair mechanisms, which use a newly synthesized sister chromatid as a template to replicate past the impediment, while telomere truncations, likely caused by the collapse of replication forks, can be extended by break-induced replication."

We are interested in whether there exist groups who are repeatedly infected with helminthes over time in areas where treatment is ongoing. Such individuals may be at risk of morbidity and may also serve as parasite reservoirs, making them appropriate targets for disease control programs. We followed two cohorts in rural Sichuan, China in order to evaluate whether the same individuals were repeatedly infected with the water-borne helminth, Schistosoma japonicum. Each participant was tested for infection at enrollment and two follow-up points – all infections were promptly treated. We conducted detailed interviews to assess exposures to S. japonicum. We found infections repeatedly occurred in a subgroup of individuals and this clustering of infections was only partly explained by differences in exposure. This suggests some individuals may be particularly susceptible to S. japonicum infection. Further exploration of the interplay of exposure and susceptibility suggest that as exposure declines, so too does the fraction of the population vulnerable to infection. Helminth control programs that target people with a history of infection may efficiently reduce helminth infections and morbidity."

Nerve damage caused by the infection may lead to permanent disabilities, and can happen even during MDT and subsequent to patient release. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the leprosy bacillus and humans is mandatory in order to develop new tools for better disease control and management. Aiming to understand more about the effects of leprosy on human metabolism, we analyzed the chemical composition of sera from leprosy patients before and after MDT. Our results show that specific classes of molecules are affected by the infection, and that MDT can partially reverse these effects. In particular, lipids related to polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism and known to play a role in the host's defense mechanisms were highly affected during the disease. A complete understanding of all the steps in this process may open new avenues for leprosy treatment with consequent prevention of neuropathy."

We used genomic approaches to identify lbl1-dependent small RNAs and their targets to determine the basis for these polarity defects. This revealed substantial diversity in small RNA pathways across plant species and identified unexpected roles for LBL1 in the regulation of repetitive elements within the maize genome. We further show that only ta-siRNA loci belonging to the TAS3 family function in the maize vegetative apex. The TAS3-derived tasiR-ARFs are the main ta-siRNA active in the apex, and misregulation of their ARF3 targets emerges as the basis for the lbl1 leaf polarity defects. Supporting this, we show that plants expressing arf3a transcripts insensitive to tasiR-ARF-directed cleavage recapitulate the phenotypes observed in lbl1. The TAS3 ta-siRNA pathway, including the regulation of ARF3 genes, is conserved throughout land plant evolution, yet the phenotypes of plants defective for ta-siRNA biogenesis are strikingly different. Our data leads us to propose that divergence in the processes regulated by the ARF3 transcription factors or the spatiotemporal pattern during development in which these proteins act, underlies the diverse developmental contributions of this small RNA pathway across plants."

Much theoretical work on this topic assumes that the strength, or weight, of a synapse may vary continuously and be unbounded. More recent studies have considered synapses that have a limited number of discrete states. In dynamical models of such synapses, old memories are automatically overwritten by new memories, and it has been previously difficult to optimize performance using standard capacity measures, for stronger learning typically implies faster forgetting. Here, we propose an information theoretic measure of storage capacity of such forgetting systems, and use this to optimize the learning rules. We find that for parameters comparable to those found in biology, capacity of discrete synapses is similar to that of unbounded, continuous synapses, provided the number of synapses per neuron is limited. Our findings are relevant for experiments investigating the precise nature of synaptic changes during learning, and also pave a path for further work on building biologically realistic memory models."

Outbreaks of RVFV have resulted in devastating morbidity and mortality in livestock and humans. A novel RVFV vaccine strain has been developed in which two virulence genes, NSs and NSm, have been deleted from the RVFV genome. Previously, we demonstrated that deletion of NSm also significantly reduced the ability of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to transmit RVFV. The objective of this study was to track the spread (dissemination) of wild type RVFV (rRVF-wt) and RVFV lacking the NSm virulence gene (rRVF-ΔNSm) through different tissues in the mosquito body over time by staining lengthwise slices of infected mosquitoes with fluorescent antibody specific to RVFV. We found that midgut infections in mosquitoes exposed to rRVF-wt were extensive, whereas midgut infections in mosquitoes infected with rRVF-ΔNSm were confined to only one or a few small foci. Our data provide supporting evidence that the NSm virulence gene has a functional role in mosquitoes by helping RVFV establish an infection in, and escape from, the midgut."

The recombinant protein (rLiHyp1) was recognized by antibodies from sera of asymptomatic and symptomatic canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL), but presented no cross-reactivity with sera of vaccinated dogs, those with Chagas' disease or healthy animals. In addition, the rLiHyp1 plus saponin was able to induce a Th1 response, which was based on the production of high levels of IFN-γ, IL-12, and GM-CSF after in vitro stimulation in BALB/c mice. The protective efficacy of rLiHyp1 plus saponin was evaluated in mice challenged with L. infantum promastigotes. Challenged and vaccinated mice showed significant reductions in the number of parasites in all evaluated organs, and the protection was associated with a Th1-type response. Therefore, the present study reveals a new potential candidate for the improvement of serodiagnosis of CVL, as well as an effective vaccine candidate against VL."

In this manuscript, we investigate the molecular associations between different protein components of insulators (BEAF32, CP190 and Chromator) by biochemical and biophysical means, and develop a novel biophysical assay to determine what factors are necessary and essential for the formation of long-range DNA interactions (LRI). Importantly, we show that CP190 and Chromator are able to mediate LRIs between specifically-bound BEAF32 nucleoprotein complexes. This ability of CP190 and Chromator to establish LRI requires specific contacts between BEAF32 and their C-terminal domains, and dimerization through their N-terminal domains. In particular, the BTB/POZ domains of CP190 form a strict homodimer. We propose a general model for insulator function in which BEAF32/dCTCF/Su(HW) provide DNA specificity, whereas CP190/Chromator are responsible for the physical interactions required for long-range contacts. This network of organized, multi-layer interactions could explain the different activities of insulators, and suggest a general mechanism for how insulators may shape the organization of higher-order chromatin during cell division."

They are essential to many cellular processes, such as the regulation of gene expression, genome organization, and cell-fate determination. They also govern growth, development, and ultimately human health. Heterochromatin constitutes silenced chromatic domains, in which gene silencing occurs through epigenetic mechanisms. RNA processing pathways, such as RNA interference (RNAi) and the exosome, are known to mediate the silencing of genes via degradation of unwanted or aberrant transcripts. In this study, we describe a new RNA processing mechanism in epigenetic silencing using fission yeast, a premier model for studying these processes. With genetic, cell biology, and genomic approaches, we uncovered a previously unrecognized function of Dhp1, a highly conserved 5’-3’ exoribonuclease and ortholog of budding yeast Rat1 and metazoan Xrn2. We show that Dhp1 mediates a novel RNA processing mechanism in epigenetic silencing which occurs independently of both RNAi and the exosome. Our results clarify how multiple RNA processing pathways are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and chromatin organization."

Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern. A number of studies have reported the fraction of treated patients from which resistant virus could be isolated. While these results provide some assessment of the danger of NI resistance, a more quantitative understanding is preferable. We specifically want to know how likely it is that an infected, treated patient infects another person with the resistant strain, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. Knowing these quantities is important for studies of the population-wide emergence of resistance. While these parameters can often be estimated from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an alternative approach that combines data from influenza infections of human volunteers with a mathematical framework. We find that the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the fraction of resistant cases reported. However, our study also clearly shows that the results depend strongly on the role the immune response plays, an issue that needs to be addressed in future studies."

The two main novelties of this work which have important implications are the following: Plasma RNA (specific to Brucella abortus in this case) has been used as a biomarker for the first time to successfully monitor the efficacy of an antibacterial therapy (in this case, immunotherapy of brucellosis). There is no published report of such a biomarker for monitoring the therapy in Brucellosis or any other bacterial infection. Bacterial counts in spleen and other organs before and after phage therapy (after sacrificing) have been used in mice. However, this is not applicable in cattle and humans. Therefore, this novel application of a specific biomarker for periodic minimally invasive and non destructive monitoring of the efficacy of antibacterial therapy could be very useful in Medicine. The phage lysate of RB51 strain of Brucella abortus has been successfully used for immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle for the first time. Although S19 lysate has been used earlier in mice for prophylaxis, it induces only antibody and not cell mediated immune response which is essential for protection against intracellular pathogens like Brucella."

As all viruses employ cellular ribosomes for protein translation, most cytoplasmically replicating eukaryotic viruses including coronaviruses have evolved strategies to cap their RNAs. It was shown very recently that ribose 2′-O-methylation in the cap structure of viral RNAs plays an important role in viral escape from innate immune recognition. The 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) encoded by SARS coronavirus is composed of two subunits, the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10, which is different from all other known 2′-O-MTases that are partner-independent. Here we show that the role of nsp10 is to promote nsp16 to bind capped RNA substrate and the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). We solved the crystal structure of the nsp16/nsp10/SAM complex, and the structural analysis revealed that the details of the inter-molecular interactions and indicated that nsp10 may stabilize the SAM-binding pocket and extend the capped RNA-binding groove. The interaction interface of nsp16/nsp10 is unique for coronaviruses and thus may provide an attractive target for developing specific antiviral drugs for control of coronaviruses including the deadly SARS coronavirus."

To prevent lethal breaches in this protective layer, peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases that remodel the cell wall must be carefully regulated but the mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. The noncanonical ABC transporter FtsEX has emerged as a broadly conserved regulator of PG hydrolases. In most characterized examples, FtsEX is integrated into the division machinery where it controls cell wall cleavage during cytokinesis. By contrast, in Bacillus subtilis the FtsEX complex functions in cell wall elongation. Here, we report the identification of two previously uncharacterized proteins (SweD and SweC) that function as essential co-factors of FtsEX in controlling PG hydrolase activity along the lateral cell wall. Homologs of SweD and SweC are found in a subset of firmicutes. We propose that these and analogous factors enable FtsEX to function outside the divisome to control cell wall elongation hydrolases."

Often times, such models contain parameters that are structurally unidentifiable, i.e., they cannot be uniquely determined from experiments. Any parameter estimation algorithm will fail when trying to estimate unidentifiable parameters, leading to waste of resources and possibly wrong model predictions. Hence, it is essential to assess structural identifiability before exploiting a model. However, performing such analysis can be hard, especially as models become increasingly complicated. To address this challenge, we developed a methodology for structural identifiability analysis that aims at generality—it can handle any analytic model written as a set of ordinary differential equations—and computational efficiency—it includes features that facilitate the analysis of large systems. We provide an implementation of the methodology as a MATLAB toolbox called STRIKE-GOLDD. We illustrate its applicability to systems biology models of genetic, signalling, metabolic, and pharmacokinetic networks, showing which of them are unidentifiable and how they can be made identifiable."

We detected a set of SNPs within the EFEMP1 gene associated with BA in both cohorts. We further showed by immunohistochemistry that EFEMP1 protein was expressed in cholangiocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in BA livers, and that EFEMP1 RNA expression levels were elevated in both BA and other cholestatic disease livers.

The use of these same drugs for many years to control livestock nematodes has resulted in the emergence of significant levels of resistance. Hence, there is a need to manage the use of drugs against human STHs in order to reduce the likelihood of resistance developing. An important component of managing drug use will be an ability to detect drug resistance should it emerge. WHO and the World Bank are presently supporting initiatives to develop tools for detecting drug resistance in human STHs. The tool to be assessed in the short term is the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). We have examined literature on an aspect of worm reproductive biology with potential to impact significantly on the FECRT. We describe the potential effects that density dependent egg production by female hookworms may have on interpretation of FECRT data. This study highlights a potential weakness in reliance on the FECRT for assessment of drug resistance in human hookworms, hence emphasising the need to develop more advanced worm bioassay and molecular methods."

After shuffling, the chromosomes consist of alternating sequences of genes from each parent, where the switches are the result of ‘crossovers’. Recombination is essential for eggs and sperm to receive the correct number of chromosomes, failure in which is an important cause of miscarriage, birth defects and mental retardation. Males have the particular challenge of recombining between the X and Y chromosomes. Unlike the other 22 chromosome pairs, the X and Y chromosomes do not match up, except for a small special region called PAR1, which must host a crossover. We investigate recombination in PAR1 by building a ‘map’ of where it occurs in African-American families. We use a variety of approaches, both analytical and experimental, to demonstrate the role of a protein called PRDM9 in marking crossovers in this region. PRDM9 has previously been shown to position crossovers on the other chromosomes, but a role in PAR1 was unexpected based on research in mice. We also show that the recombination map has changed in the evolutionary history of PAR1, both among human populations, and between human and chimpanzee."

To our surprise, we found that the mice lacking these elements are viable, fertile, and show no apparent abnormalities. This completely unexpected finding indicates that extreme levels of DNA sequence conservation are not necessarily indicative of an indispensable functional nature."

Our data indicated that the primary mechanism of ZEBOV uptake is a macropinocytosis-like process that delivers the virus to early endosomes and subsequently to late endosomes.

When the amino acid glycine 12 is mutated, KRAS protein acquires oncogenic properties that result in tumor cell-growth and cancer progression. These mutations prevail especially in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which is a cancer with an exceptionally dismal prognosis. To date, there is a limited understanding of the different mutations at the position 12, also regarding whether the different mutations would have different consequences. These discrepancies could have major implications for the future drug therapies targeting KRAS mutant harboring tumors. In this study, we made a critical assessment of the observed frequency of KRAS G12X mutations and the underlying causes for these frequencies. We also assessed KRAS G12X mutant discrepancies on an atomistic level by utilizing state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the dynamics of the mutants does not only differ from the wild-type protein, but there is also a profound difference among the different mutants. These results emphasize that the different KRAS G12X mutations are not equal, and thereby they suggest that the future research related to mutant KRAS biology should account for these observations."

During an everyday task such as finding an object in a cluttered environment (known as visual search), observers take longer to find a target as the number of distractors increases. This well-known phenomenon implies that inputs from distractors interfere with the brain's ability to perceive the target at some stage or stages of neural processing. However, the loci and mechanisms of this interference are unknown. Visual information is processed in feature-selective areas that encode the physical properties of stimuli and in higher-order areas that convey information about behavioral significance and help direct attention to individual stimuli. Here we studied a higher-order parietal area related to attention and eye movements. We found that parietal neurons selectively track the location of a search target during a difficult visual search task. However, neuronal firing rates decreased as distractors were added to the display, and the decrease in the target-related response correlated with the set-size-related increase in reaction time. This suggests that distractors trigger competitive visuo-visual interactions that limit the brain's ability to find and focus on a task-relevant target."

The GR is the effector for a class of drugs known as corticosteroids, which are widely used in medicine for their anti-inflammatory effects and ability to induce apoptosis in leukaemic cells. However, side effects, treatment-related toxicity and glucocorticoid resistance remain and therefore increased understanding of the glucocorticoid receptor mechanism of action may improve therapeutic outcomes. The GEB052 model presented herein has been used to generate predictions for how the network is altered between glucocorticoid-sensitive and glucocorticoid-resistant scenarios, and these predictions have been verified using published gene expression data from established cell lines (for both qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis). The model has also been preliminarily assessed as a predictive clinical tool by correlating model predictions with clinical outcomes of thirteen leukaemia patients. Thus, the GEB052 model demonstrates successful modelling to understand GR function. GEB052 provides accurate predictions and has indicated potential routes through which glucocorticoid resistance may arise. The work presented herein thus demonstrates a proof-of-principle of this modelling approach to furthering GR research, and provides insight into potential mechanisms of corticosteroids resistance."

Here, we describe a high-throughput approach that harnesses the power of modern graphics hardware to search a vast space of large-scale, biologically inspired candidate models of the visual system. The best of these models, drawn from thousands of candidates, outperformed a variety of state-of-the-art vision systems across a range of object and face recognition tasks.

A key step in cargo delivery requires the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the target membrane mediated by SNARE proteins. In most cellular compartments, fusion occurs constitutively, requiring little participation of other molecules. In other cellular compartments, such as synapses in the nervous system, vesicle fusion is predominantly triggered by intracellular calcium ions. At present, constitutive and regulated fusion modes are not well understood.In this study, we found that a mutant SNARE protein, syntaxin at the synapse, contained a building block commonly conserved for syntaxins functioning along constitutive secretory pathways. Further, our modeling predicted that the mutant syntaxin could form a tightly packed SNARE bundle closely resembling that found in the endosome, but differing from the relatively loosely packed bundle found at the wild-type synapse. Our experimental data support the hypothesis that the mutant syntaxin lowered the energy barrier for vesicle fusion by tightening the SNARE bundle. These findings reveal a novel, intrinsic structural feature of the SNARE complex that regulates vesicle fusion rate at different cellular compartments."

In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes an equal amount of genetic information, packaged in chromosomes, to the offspring. Diploid organisms, like humans, have two copies of every chromosome, while their haploid gametes (e.g. eggs and sperm) have only one. This reduction in ploidy depends on the segregation of chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in gametes with one copy of each chromosome. Missegregation of the chromosomes in the parents leads to abnormal chromosome numbers in the offspring, which is usually lethal or has detrimental developmental effects. While it has been known for over a century that homologous chromosomes pair and recombine to facilitate proper segregation, how homologs find their partners has remained elusive. A structure that has been central to the discussion of homolog pairing is the bouquet, or the dynamic clustering of telomeres during early stages of meiosis. Here we use zebrafish to show that the telomere bouquet is the site where key events leading to homologous chromosome pairing are coordinated. Furthermore, we show that deletion of spo11, a gene required for proper recombination in most studied organisms, resulted in very different effects in males and females where males were sterile while females produced deformed progeny."

For example, there are distinct temperatures for water freezing and ice melting. Similarly, it has been found that state transitions related to consciousness exhibit hysteresis. In particular, the concentration of general anesthetics required to achieve loss of consciousness is significantly higher than the concentration at which consciousness is regained. However, it is unknown whether this is trivially reducible to the pharmacology of these drugs or if it is something related to brain function itself. In this study, we took a novel, network-based approach and hypothesized that the hysteresis observed during anesthetic state transitions shares the same underlying mechanism as that observed in non-biological networks. Our computational modeling, analytic study, and high-density human EEG analysis suggest that various hysteresis phenomena during loss and recovery of consciousness can be explained in principled ways by generic network features. Identifying these network mechanisms of hysteresis in the brain also provides a unified framework for understanding the radically different conscious state transitions associated with sleep, anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness."

However, the same mosquitoes that transmit P. falciparum parasites also transmit three other species of malaria (P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax) and the worm that causes lymphatic filariasis. To date, we do not know how much transmission of the three other species of malaria occurs. We also do not know if control interventions such as the distribution of bed nets reduce the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and non-falciparum malaria. To address this question, we sampled community members immediately following and one year after a bed net distribution campaign in Mozambique. We analyzed their blood for the presence of antibodies to four species of malaria and lymphatic filariasis. We found that a substantial proportion of individuals had antibodies to P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and the worms causing lymphatic filariasis. We found much lower rates of seropositivity to P. vivax. Individuals reporting using bed nets had a lower risk of testing positive for P. falciparum and P. malariae antibodies. The proportion of the population with access to and using bed nets was too low to cause a population-wide decrease in malaria transmission. There was a significant decline in lymphatic filariasis seropositivity between the two surveys, but we could not attribute it to the bed net distribution campaign. Measuring antibody levels for multiple diseases simultaneously has utility in assessing intervention impact."

Scoliosis caused by a primary problem related to the spine itself is classified into congenital scoliosis (CS) and idiopathic scoliosis (IS). Among these, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the most common form of scoliosis, is known as a common polygenic disease. Severe curving of the spine in scoliosis leads to profound psychological and social impacts, but etiology-based therapies have not been established since the precise pathological mechanisms of both IS and CS remain undefined. Previously, we identified an AIS susceptibility locus near human ladybird homeobox 1 (LBX1) by a genome-wide association study. Here, we report the functional characterization of the most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11190870 and LBX1 as well as its zebrafish homologues. Overexpression of LBX1 and zebrafish lbx genes caused lateral body curvature in association with the impairment of non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling. Thus, our study presents a novel pathological feature of LBX1 in body axis deformation."

We identify negative regulatory pathways that suppress pathogenic matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression in primary human macrophages, including a previously unidentified role of the MAP kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) pathway in inhibiting protease secretion. Furthermore, these pathways are suppressed in granulomas of patients with culture-proven pulmonary tuberculosis and in infected macrophages in vitro. Stability of mRNA encoding negative regulatory molecules is reduced, and Mtb upregulates multiple microRNAs predicted to target their 3’UTR. Together, these findings demonstrate that Mtb skews the macrophage phenotype towards tissue destruction by disrupting negative regulatory pathways."

Here, we propose that GlmR presides over a new mechanism for the regulation of carbon partitioning between central metabolism and peptidoglycan biosynthesis: GlmR activates the GlmS-dependent diversion of carbon from the glycolytic pathway into peptidoglycan synthesis. This effect is particularly important during gluconeogenesis since the GlmS substrate fructose 6-phosphate is present at a reduced level under these conditions."

This so called probing behavior comprises the “searching” time, the beginning of the feeding process until the first sign of blood can be seen within the insect body. The manipulation of this behavior can have important consequences for the mosquito's ability to transmit pathogens, such as dengue virus or Plasmodium. In this study we examined the probing behavior of the main vector of dengue viruses, Aedes aegypti, when infected with an intracellular bacterium, Wolbachia pipientis. This bacterium alters the probing behavior of older mosquitoes such that they take longer to find a feeding site and longer to imbibe blood, which may make them more susceptible to human defense responses. The bacterium appears to reduce mosquito feeding success by preventing the mosquito from successfully inserting its stylet into human skin. The old age onset of reduced mosquito feeding success due to Wolbachia could selectively promote a reduction in dengue transmission."

Expression of the seed maturation program is tightly controlled such that it only occurs during the late phase of seed development. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the repression of seed genes during vegetative development, we performed a reporter-assisted genetic screen, and one mutant identified is a weak allele of ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) that displays ectopic seed gene expression. We then performed a series of transgenic and genetic analyses to search for the molecular mechanisms underlying the mutant phenotype. We first demonstrate that the decrease in miR166 in ago1 is a major cause of the mutant phenotype. Further, we show that the targets of miR166, type III HD-ZIP transcription factors PHB and PHV, are sufficient for derepressing seed maturation genes in seedlings, likely by binding directly to the promoter of a master regulator gene of maturation. Thus, this work establishes a miRNA–mediated pathway that represses the embryonic program and also establishes PHB/PHV as direct activators of the maturation program."

The importance of these routes has implications for disease control, because we can often restrict host movement, and so potentially reduce spread, but cannot easily restrict insect movements. Despite this, the importance of host movements has been little studied. Here we develop a mathematical model which allows us to disentangle and quantify transmission by insect dispersal and by host movement. We apply the model to two diseases of cattle and sheep transmitted by biting midges that have emerged in northern Europe in the past decade, bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus (SBV). For both viruses, we show insect movements account for a majority of spread between farms. Although they cannot sustain an epidemic on their own, animal movements play an important role in introducing disease to new areas."

Features of primary care associated with better SRH differed between countries.The expansion of primary care in LMICs can be informed by better evidence on which of its features—including ease of communication, comprehensiveness of care, and support for coordination of care—are associated with better self-reported health status.While individual-level administrative data are not yet widely available for health systems in LMICs, patient-reported survey data may serve as an instrument to assess healthcare services and to inform policy-makers in their efforts to increase the quality of primary care services."

High levels of IS element expansion were also found in these bacteria, and the IS elements were suggested to play a role in genome reductive evolution. Here we provide evidence for stepwise IS actions as the exclusive mechanism that mediates bacterial genomic changes during the early stage of constant host-bacterial association, by unveiling the processes that resulted in the development of B. mallei genome. We show the details of the multi-level interplay of IS elements, which facilitate the wide spread of the IS copies, and the overall mechanics in genome reduction and rearrangement. These processes appeared to operate as chain reactions mediating elaborate genomic transition, without seriously affecting the original gene expression patterns. The absence of differential gene expression in the resulting genome suggests that changes in transcriptional regulation that are often observed in other old bacterial genomes may take place subsequent to the IS-mediated steps, along with gradual nucleotide-level changes."

Thus, persistent pDC activation has been implicated in contributing to AIDS pathogenesis. To define the role of pDC in HIV-1 infection and immunopathogenesis in vivo, we developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically and efficiently depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice. We discover that pDC are the critical IFN-I producer cells in response to acute HIV-1 infection, because depletion of pDC completely abolished induction of IFN-I or ISG by HIV-1 infection, correlated with elevated level of HIV-1 replication. When pDC were depleted during chronic HIV-1 infection in humanized mice, pDC were still the major IFN-I producing cells in vivo, which contributed to HIV-1 suppression. Despite of higher level of viral replication in pDC-depleted mice, we found that HIV-induced depletion of human T cells and leukocytes was significantly reduced in lymphoid organs, correlated with reduced cell death induction by HIV-1 infection. Our findings demonstrate that pDC play two opposing roles in HIV-1 pathogenesis: they produce IFN-I to suppress HIV-1 replication and induce death of human immune cells to contribute to HIV-induced T cell depletion and immunopathogenesis."

Deciphering the way in which artificial selection acts on the silkworm genome to improve the utilization of nitrogen resources, thereby advancing human-favored domestication traits, will provide clues from a unique insect model for understanding the general rules of Darwin's theory on artificial selection. However, the mechanisms of domestication in the silkworm remain largely unknown. In this study, we focused on one important nitrogen resource, the storage protein (SP). We discovered that the methionine-rich storage protein 1 (SP1), which is divergent from other SPs, is the only target of artificial selection. Based on functional evidence, together with key findings from the comprehensive comparative transcriptome, we propose that artificial selection favored higher expression of SP1 in the domestic silkworm, which would influence the genes or pathways vital for egg development and eggshell formation. Artificial selection also consistently favored activated ribosome activities and improved amide and peptide biosynthesis in the ova, like what they may act in the silk gland to increase silk-cocoon yield. We highlighted a novel case in which artificial selection could directly act on a nitrogen resource protein associated with a human-desired domestication trait."

A small group of snake venom toxins belonging to the C-type lectin protein family exert their harmful effects by directly targeting this pathway. Rhodocetin (RC) is a heterotetrameric protein found in the venom of the Malayan pit viper (C. rhodostoma). RC specifically binds α2β1 integrin, the key protein required for collagen-mediated platelet aggregation. In this study, we describe the interaction between RC and α2β1 integrin at atomic resolution. This study reveals that RC undergoes a massive structural reorganization upon α2β1 integrin binding, such that RC’s αβ subunit is released from its γδ subunit and a γδ-α2β1 integrin complex is formed. The inhibitory nature of this complex can be readily explained as RC binding along the top surface of the α2β1 integrin and directly above the collagen binding site. As a result, access of collagen to its binding site is blocked, thereby preventing collagen-mediated platelet aggregation."

After being taken up by host cells, CDTs are trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they must translocate across the ER membrane to gain access to their intracellular target; however, this translocation process is poorly understood for CDTs. Here we provide evidence that CDTs require components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a normal cellular process utilized to translocate terminally misfolded ER lumenal and membrane proteins across the ER membrane for degradation in the cytosol. Deletion of a key member of this pathway, Derl2, makes cells resistant to multiple CDTs. Interestingly, two domains within Derl2 which are required for ERAD of misfolded proteins are dispensable for intoxication by CDT. Further, we report two previously uncharacterized domains within Derl2 that are each required for intoxication. Consistent with a role of Derl2, abrogation of two other members of the ERAD pathway, Hrd1 and p97, results in retention of CDT in the ER and resistance to intoxication. Taken together, these data provide novel insight into how CDTs exit the ER and therefore gain access to their cellular targets."

The only available vaccine that could be potentially beneficial against these diseases is BCG. Even though BCG vaccine is widely used, the results on its effectiveness are partially contradictory, probably since different BCG strains are used. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effect of BCG vaccines on BUD. The present study was performed in three different countries and sites where BUD is endemic: in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, and Togo from 2010 through 2013. The large study population was comprised of 401 cases with laboratory confirmed BUD and 826 controls, mostly family members or neighbors. Considering the three countries, sex, and age, the analysis confirmed that the BCG vaccination did not significantly decrease the risk for developing BUD or for developing severe forms of BUD. Furthermore, the status of BCG vaccination was also not significantly related to duration of BUD or to time to healing of lesions. In our study, we could not find any evidence of a protective effect of routine BCG vaccination on BUD."

To optimize control programs against these worms, large-scale surveys are required to determine the worm distribution to initiate control and to monitor the success of the programs. These large-scale surveys come at an important cost for governments, which in resource-limited countries present major challenges. During a nationwide survey in Ethiopia, we assessed whether the examination of pooled rather than individual samples could be a cost-saving strategy to assess prevalence and intensity of worm infections (which is an indicator of worm-related morbidity and success of the control program). We showed that a pooled examination strategy was useful in estimating the intensity of worm infections, but that it underestimated prevalence. Examination of pooled samples significantly reduced laboratory time, but it only resulted in limited financial gain."

Here we have demonstrated that viperin is also anti-viral against the medically significant arbovirus, dengue virus. Viperin was able to inhibit dengue virus at the level of viral replication, and cell lines unable to produce normal levels of viperin grew the virus to higher titres. These anti-dengue effects of viperin were mediated by amino acid residues in its C-terminus, and did not require structural domains of the N-terminal region as has been previously shown by us and others for the related virus, hepatitis C virus. Viperin was also demonstrated to co-localise and interact with the dengue capsid protein on the surface of lipid droplets, as well as with the NS3 protein and viral RNA. Viperin's association with NS3 was further demonstrated to be involved in its anti-dengue activities. The anti-viral activities of viperin presented in this manuscript show both similarities and contrasts with other described anti-viral mechanisms for the protein and highlight the diverse nature of this unique anti-viral host protein."

Evolution has led to highly complex networks of DNA repair enzymes, which for the majority of individuals are extremely effective in keeping our DNA intact. The devastating consequences of DNA damage are manifested in those individuals in which one or other of the repair pathways is non-functional. Several genetic disorders can be attributed to such DNA repair deficiencies and have the common feature of increased tumor incidence as the major life-threatening symptom. Cancer incidence varies amongst these disorders and is probably highest for the disease Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome, where more than 50% of patients develop a hematological malignancy in childhood. We have sought to understand this extremely high incidence by exploiting cells from a mouse model and cells derived from patients. We find that deficiency in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks leads to disturbances in cellular metabolism, leading ultimately to a loss of antioxidative capacity. The ensuing accumulation of highly reactive oxygen species generates further DNA lesions, thus potentiating the initial damage and increasing the likelihood of malignancy."

Though the widespread abundance of ERVs is due to their ability to self replicate, some ERVs are known to have become important to host processes including placentation, and in the case of HERV-H, the functioning of human stem cells. In our study we place the insertion and deletion activity of primate ERV families in direct quantitative comparison. In particular, we show that ERV deletion is an age dependent process, so that as an ERV ages it becomes less likely to be deleted at any given instant. We also find that ERVs from the HERV-H family are unusually slowly deleted, an interesting result that suggests that the exaptation of HERV-H may have involved internal regions of the virus and not just its terminal promoters. Assuming the behaviour of primate ERVs is not unusual, our study suggests that future bioinformatics screening for ERVs with slow deletion dynamics could help identify large-scale exaptations in distant species. Furthermore, as we demonstrate that ERVs are deleted rapidly, we think that such screening could be performed using ratios of conserved to deleted elements and could therefore be applied to single genomes."

Integrin transmembrane receptors mediate muscle attachments at highly localized sites, but how this pattern of attachments is continuously maintained with muscle use is not understood. Human X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a frequently fatal muscle disease, is associated with mutations in the MTM1 lipid regulator. Myotubularin (MTM) lipid phosphatases are implicated in endocytosis, a process of cellular uptake that can traffic transmembrane receptors for redelivery to the plasma membrane or to protein destruction. Here, we address MTM roles in muscle, using the genetically tractable fruit fly for detailed investigation of muscle cellular organization and functions. We show that fly muscle cells depleted for mtm function exhibit hallmarks of human XLMTM. We found that mtm regulates integrin localization through endocytosis and, in this role, is needed to maintain muscle attachments. Co-depletion of Class II PI3-kinase with mtm restores normal integrin localization at muscle attachment sites and fly survival, identifying a potential therapy target in MTM-related disease. Importantly, we show that integrin localization is also disrupted in human XLMTM. Our work shows conservation of MTM function in integrin trafficking and reveals insights into regulation of muscle cell maintenance and human disease."

We found that the introduction of a single infected capybara, with at least one infected attached tick, is enough to trigger the disease in a non-endemic area. To avoid disease propagation, it is crucial to impede the emigration of capybaras from endemic areas by keeping the population in a stable state. Otherwise, to eliminate the disease from endemic areas, a reduction by more than 58% in the capybara birth rate is necessary. These results allow improving the planning of public actions to prevent Brazilian Spotted fever based on the control of capybara population and provided a basis for planning prevention programs for other neglected vector-borne diseases."

Although the cytosol is an aqueous environment, it contains high concentrations of ions, metabolites, and proteins, making it very different from dilute aqueous solution, which is frequently used for in vitro biochemistry. Recent advances in metabolomics have provided detailed concentration data for metabolites in E.coli. We used this information to construct accurate atomistic models of the cytosol solution. We find that, unlike the situation in dilute solutions, most metabolites spend the majority of their time in contact with other metabolites, or in contact with proteins. Furthermore, we find large non-covalently interacting metabolite structures are common and often associated with proteins. The presence of proteins reduced metabolite diffusion owing to long lasting correlations of motion. The dielectric constant of these simulations was found to differ from that of pure water only through a large contribution from proteins as metabolite and monatomic ion effects largely cancel. These findings suggest specific protein spheres of influence affecting metabolite diffusion and the electrostatic environment."

We were able to show that repellent insensitivity is linked to reduced insecticide susceptibility and increased knock down resistance allele frequency, indicating that sub-lethal doses of airborne transfluthrin can elicit SR behaviors in mosquitoes by inducing an agitated state via neurotoxic pathways independent of olfactory stimulation. This raises questions about how the use of volatile pyrethroid repellents may impact insecticide resistance in target vectors over time, highlighting the need to further understand all of the physiological drivers of SR behaviors and emphasizing the requirement to develop new repellent active ingredients with novel, non-toxic mechanisms of action."

By constructing a mechanistic framework to assess the risk of drug resistance, we provide guidelines for rational design and adaptive management of these promising new therapies. In particular, we identify a high-risk period when missing doses is particularly risky, and quantify the number of extra doses needed to compensate when doses are missed. This framework is a step towards developing a tool for clinicians to design combination therapies and adaptively manage treatment regimens to achieve favorable clinical outcomes."

One such critical interface is formed between the proteins, human BRCA2 and RAD51. BRCA2 binds to and delivers RAD51 to sites of DNA damage, where RAD51 mediates the error-free repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Mutations in BRCA2 have been linked to breast cancer predisposition. Therefore, an accurate picture of the interactions between these two proteins is of great importance. BRCA2 interacts with RAD51 via eight “BRC repeats” that are similar, but not identical, in sequence. Due to lack of experimental structural information regarding the binding of seven of the eight BRC repeats to RAD51, it is unknown how subtle sequence variations in the repeats translate to measurable variations in their binding affinity. We have used a range of computational methods, firstly based on classical force fields, and secondly based on first principles quantum mechanical techniques whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of atoms, allowing us to perform calculations on the entire protein complex. This is the first study comparing all eight BRC repeats at the atomic scale and our results provide critical insights into the control of RAD51 by human BRCA2."

Interestingly though, even in situations where every cell of every tissue of an organism carries the same mutation (as is the case for germline mutations), some tissues are more susceptible to the development of disease over time than others. For example, in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), affected persons carry different germline mutations in the APC gene and are prone to developing cancers of the colon and the rectum—and, less frequently, cancers in other tissues such as stomach, liver, and bones. Here we utilize a panel of mutant mice with truncating or hypomorphic mutations in the Apc gene, resulting in different levels of activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our results reveal that different pathophysiological outcomes depend on different permissive signaling thresholds in embryonic, intestinal, and liver tissues. Importantly, we demonstrate that reducing Wnt pathway activation by 50% is enough to prevent the manifestation of embryonic abnormalities and disease in the adult mouse. This raises the possibility of developing therapeutic strategies that modulate the activation levels of this pathway rather than trying to “repair” the mutation in the gene itself."

To maintain the “off” state of certain genes in silenced regions, regulatory DNA sequences called silencers, which reside within a rapidly mutating region, must co-evolve with the regulatory proteins that bind these sequences to turn off transcription. Although hypothesized to occur widely in nature, such “molecular co-evolution” of genetic regulators has been demonstrated in only a few cases. Unlike previous examples of gene regulatory co-evolution, we found that the transcription factors that bind silencers in two budding yeast species are, in fact, functionally interchangeable, even though the silencers are not. Surprisingly, the Sir1 and Sir4 silencing proteins, which are heterochromatin components that bind the transcription factors rather than the silencer DNA sequences per se, are the proteins engaged in rapid co-evolution with the silencers. Silencer sequences therefore contain additional, evolutionarily labile information directing the assembly of heterochromatin. As mutations in Sir1 and Sir4 over evolutionary time can compensate for changes in the silencers, this “extra information” likely involves cooperative assembly of the transcription factors with the Sir1 and Sir4 “adaptor” proteins. The localization patterns of two species' Sir4 proteins across both species' genomes in interspecies yeast hybrids illuminate unexpected features of heterochromatin structure and assembly."

We postulated that same-sex mating between α isolates may occur naturally, as it does under laboratory conditions. By analyzing natural Cryptococcus diploid hybrid isolates containing two α alleles of different serotypic origins, this study demonstrates that same-sex mating transpires in nature. The observations that Sxi1α, a sex regulator encoded by the mating type locus, is frequently altered in C. neoformans hybrids but rarely in the haploid population, and that Sxi1α is also altered in the fertile VGIII group of the sibling species C. gattii by a different mutation support the hypothesis that these SXI1α mutations may enhance fertility, possibly in concert with other genomic changes.

We identified new class-II epitopes within Salmonella type-III secretion system effector proteins and generated a methodology to visualize endogenous T cells responding to these epitopes. Our study shows that Salmonella flagellin generates a mixed Th1 and Th17 response that contracts early and is enriched in mucosal tissues. In contrast, we found that Salmonella T3SS effectors generate a sustained Th1 response that requires a persisting infection and is enriched in systemic tissues. These data demonstrate that in vivo antigen regulation substantially alters the antigen specificity, helper differentiation, and anatomical location of pathogen-specific CD4 T cells."

In this work, we have focused on the most severe end of the spectrum, severe obesity with early-onset in childhood, which is more likely due to genetic alterations. We screened for rare copy number variation (CNV) a sample of 157 Spanish children with early-onset obesity using molecular karyotypes and then studied the genes altered by CNVs in 480 cases and 480 non-obese controls. We identified a higher burden of gain-type CNVs in cases as well as several CNVs and sequence variants that were specific of the obese population. Interestingly, the genes identified shared co-expression partners with known obesity genes. Among those, the genes encoding the neuropeptide Y (NPY), two glutamate receptors (GRIK1, GRM7), the X-linked gastrin-peptide receptor (GRPR), and the organic anion transporter (SLCO4C1) are novel obesity candidate genes that may contribute to highly penetrant forms of familial obesity."

Network assembly involves targeted neuronal growth followed by recognition of the appropriate target cells and selective synapse formation. How neuronal processes select their appropriate target cells from an array of interaction partners is poorly understood. In this study, we have addressed this question for the axons emerging from the pontine gray nucleus, a major brainstem nucleus that relays information between the cortex and the cerebellum, a brain area responsible for the control of skilled movements but also emotional processing. Using advanced microscopy techniques, we find that developing mossy fibers establish synaptic contacts rather promiscuously, and elaborate extensive synapses with Purkinje cells, an inappropriate target. These contacts are subsequently eliminated, and proper synaptic connectivity is then restricted to granule and Golgi neurons. We identify bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) as a regulator of these inappropriate mossy fiber-Purkinje cell contacts. BMP growth factors are best known for their functions in cell specification during embryonic development, and our results support an additional retrograde signaling function between axons and their target cells in early postnatal stages. In summary, we show that the specificity of the synaptic connections in the ponto-cerebellar circuit emerges through extensive elimination of transient synapses."

A subset of these HPV types are the causative agents of cervical and other anogenital cancers. The infectious life cycle of HPV is dependent on differentiation of the host epithelial cell, with viral genome amplification and virion production restricted to differentiated suprabasal cells. While normal keratinocytes exit the cell cycle upon differentiation, HPV positive suprabasal cells are able to re-enter S-phase to mediate productive replication. The mechanisms regulating the activation of differentiation-dependent viral replication are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV induces an ATM-dependent DNA damage response that is essential for viral genome amplification in differentiating cells. In addition, we have found that ATM signaling to its downstream target CHK2 is critical for providing an environment that is conducive to HPV productive replication. Our findings identify an important regulatory mechanism by which HPV controls replication during the productive phase of the life cycle and may identify new targets for the development of therapeutics to treat HPV-induced infections."

Each step in protein production has the potential to cause aggregation as proteins, not evolved to exist outside the cell, endure the various steps involved in commercial manufacturing processes. Mechanistic studies into protein aggregation have revealed that certain sequence regions contribute more to the aggregation propensity of a protein than other sequence regions do. Efforts to disrupt these regions have thus far indicated that rational sequence engineering is a useful technique to reduce the aggregation of biotechnologically relevant proteins. To improve our ability to rationally engineer proteins with enhanced expression, solubility, and shelf-life we conducted extensive analyses of aggregation prone regions (APRs) within protein sequences to characterize the various roles these regions play in proteins. Findings from this work indicate that protein sequences have evolved by minimizing their aggregation propensities. However, we also found that many APRs are conserved in protein families and are essential to maintain protein stability and function. Therefore, the contributions that APRs, targeted for disruption, make towards protein stability and function should be carefully evaluated when improving protein solubility via rational design."

Like most DNA viruses, papillomaviruses must deliver their genome to the cell nucleus during initial infection, where it is expressed and replicated. However, papillomaviruses make use of unconventional mechanisms for genome delivery. They reside on the cell surface for protracted, hour-long times, before they are taken up by a novel endocytic mechanism. Moreover, they are delivered to the trans-Golgi-network by non-canonical endosomal trafficking prior to nuclear delivery. For entry into the nucleus, papillomaviruses access the nuclear space after nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis unlike most other intranuclear viruses. The detailed mechanism how the viral genome is directed to nascent nuclei during mitosis remains elusive. Our previous work suggested that the minor capsid protein L2 may tether the incoming viral genome to mitotic chromosomes to direct it to the nascent nuclei. This work identifies a conserved central region in L2 protein to be necessary and sufficient for tethering. Moreover, it demonstrates that this mechanism is conserved across different papillomavirus genera. Importantly, this report also provides evidence that the processes of nuclear import by tethering and membrane penetration are mechanistically linked."

Yet the mechanisms leading to disease remain poorly understood. Here we propose a concept whereby the body's immune defense either defeats LASV rapidly or, if unsuccessful, becomes an essential facilitator of disease. This latter paradoxical postulate stems from observations in genetically engineered (HHD) mice, which we found to be susceptible to LF. HHD mice differ from resistant wild type mice in that they have a humanized repertoire of T cells, a main component of the mammalian immune system. Counterintuitively, we could protect HHD mice against LF by experimentally removing their T cells. We further found that LF correlated with widespread activation of macrophages, which again depended on T cells. Similar to T cells, macrophages are important players in our body's defense system, but their inflammatory products are also candidate mediators of LF. Taken together, these findings suggest that LF may represent an inappropriate host response to infection. Specifically, our study demonstrates a two-faced role of T cell responses against LASV. Such detrimental aspects of immune defense need to be given consideration in future LF vaccine development, to avoid enhancement of disease in vaccinated individuals."

To account for possible mechanisms of such POT representation, some network models have been proposed to show that granule cells (grcs) in the cerebellar granular layer can exhibit random alternation of burst and silent modes under feedback inhibition from Golgi cells, resulting in non-recurrent generation of active granule cells populations. On the other hand, the oscillation of local field potential (LFP) has been observed in the cerebellar granular layer when animals stay at rest. Some network models have shown that grcs can elicit synchronous spikes in an oscillatory manner. These qualitatively different neural dynamics of the granular layer raises a question of how they can be accounted for by an identical network in the granular layer. Here we report that grc activities of a biologically plausible spiking network model undergo the state transition between synchronized oscillation and random burst-silent alternation, depending on the activation of NMDA channels on the Golgi cell dendrites and the strength of a current injected to grcs."

Patients can remain asymptomatic (indeterminate) for many years, but near 30% can develop specific organ damage, mainly the heart. The pathogenesis of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is associated with parasite persistence, inadequate immune response and autoimmunity. Here we explored the bulk T cells response of chronic chagasic patients with and without cardiomyopathy, uninfected controls and patients with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy. T cells from chagasic donors expressed higher levels of activation markers, and their co-expression on CD4+ T cells distinguished those donors with or without cardiac damage. Mitogen-induced proliferation is highly impaired in the CD8+ T cells compartment, and interestingly activated CD8+ T cells are negatively correlated with the CD4+/CD28− population. The expression of the CD3ζ chain and CD28 was also diminished in chagasic patients. Furthermore, in vitro studies with blood mononuclear cells from uninfected donors showed that the indirect contact with live parasite decreased expression of CD3ζ chain and altered the T cell mitogen-induced proliferation. These results suggest a global impairment of the peripheral T cells response, which is probably associated with parasite persistence."

Melioidosis is a life threatening disease, which requires prolonged antibiotic treatment and is classically characterized by pneumonia, septicemia and multiple abscesses. Melioidosis is widely prevalent in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Of late it has been reported from tropical, subtropical and temperate regions.

Recent work in the HIV field has demonstrated that HIV-specific CD4+ T cells with unique effector functions, such as cytolytic activity and β-chemokine production, can play a direct role in control of HIV replication. However, HIV infection is generally considered to be a disease centered in lymphoid tissues, where unique CD4+ T helper cell subsets are present to orchestrate the maturation and priming of adaptive immunity. In this study, we identify that two specific transcription factors, T-bet and Eomes, mark cytolytic and β-chemokine producing CD4+ T cells. While this effector CD4+ T cell population is part of immunosurveillance mechanisms in blood, we find that lymph nodes largely lack this effector population–independent of HIV infection or disease progression status. These results indicate that current effector CD4+ T cell mediated correlates of HIV control are limited to blood and not representative of potential correlates of control in lymphoid tissues."

So far the most sensitive methods employ HMM-HMM comparison, which models a protein family using HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and then detects homologs using HMM-HMM alignment. HMM cannot model long-range residue interaction patterns and thus, carries very little information regarding the global 3D structure of a protein family. As such, HMM comparison is not sensitive enough for distantly-related homologs. In this paper, we present an MRF-MRF comparison method for homology detection. In particular, we model a protein family using Markov Random Fields (MRF) and then detect homologs by MRF-MRF alignment. Compared to HMM, MRFs are able to model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus, contains information for the overall 3D structure of a protein family. Consequently, MRF-MRF comparison is much more sensitive than HMM-HMM comparison. To implement MRF-MRF comparison, we have developed a new scoring function to measure the similarity of two MRFs and also an efficient ADMM algorithm to optimize the scoring function. Experiments confirm that MRF-MRF comparison indeed outperforms HMM-HMM comparison in terms of both alignment accuracy and remote homology detection, especially for mainly beta proteins."

Adaptive immune responses encompassing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activities are key to both the clearance of infectious virus and the control of latent infection. However, precisely how such T-cell responses are regulated, particularly within acutely infected peripheral tissues, remains poorly understood. Using a mouse model of HSV-1 skin infection, we describe a complex regulation of T-cell responses at the site of acute infection. These responses were subset-specific and anatomically distinct, with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activities being directed to distinct anatomical compartments within the skin. While IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells were broadly distributed, including skin regions a considerable distance away from infected cells, CD8+ T-cell activity was strictly confined to directly infected epithelial compartments. This unexpected spatial segregation was a direct consequence of the involvement of largely non-overlapping types of antigen-presenting cells in driving CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell effector activity. Our results provide novel insights into the cellular regulation of T-cell immunity within peripheral tissues and have the potential to guide the development of T-cell subset-specific approaches for therapeutic and prophylactic intervention in antimicrobial immunity and autoimmunity."

Although a total of 20 BSE-L and 16 BSE-H have been reported to date, the disease phenotype of these conditions remains largely unknown. Intriguingly, recent evidence has been provided that the BSE-C and BASE strains disclose converging properties after transmission to inbred mice. Here, we show that intraspecies transmission of BASE induces a disease phenotype characterized by dullness and progressive amyotrophy, the latter highly suggestive of a motor neuron disorder. This is at variance with the over-reactivity and hypersensitivity, but not muscle changes, observed in BSE-transmitted cattle. This study confirms that BASE and BSE represent two distinct prion disorders in cattle with diverging molecular features and disease phenotypes."

The greatest risk factor for severe dengue disease is a previous infection with a different serotype, which is thought to be due in part to a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) whereby anti-DENV antibodies from a prior infection augment DENV infection of target Fcg receptor (FcgR)-expressing cells. We previously developed a mouse model that demonstrates antibody-enhanced lethal DENV disease and showed that genetically-modified antibodies incapable of interacting with the FcgR eliminate ADE in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we studied a larger panel of modified MAbs that recognize different regions of the DENV envelope protein. While all modified MAbs acted therapeutically to prevent a lethal, virus-only DENV infection, only certain MAbs effectively protected mice following an antibody-enhanced lethal infection. We determined that therapeutically effective MAbs following an ADE infection worked by competing for binding of enhancing antibodies on the DENV virion. Based on this, we designed an in vitro suppression-of-enhancement assay that predicted the ability of modified MAbs to act therapeutically in vivo."

Here, we uncovered an unexpected role of DNA topoisomerase 1α (TOP1α) in the maintenance of genome stability. Eukaryotic genomes are usually littered with transposable elements (TEs) and repeats, which pose threats to genome stability due to their tendency to move or recombine. Mechanisms are in place to silence these elements, such as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) in plants. Two plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, generate small and long noncoding RNAs, respectively, from TEs and repeats. These RNAs then recruit protein factors to deposit DNA methylation or H3K9me2 to silence the loci. In this study, we found that treatment of plants with camptothecin, a TOP1α inhibitor, or loss of function in TOP1α, led to the de-repression of RdDM target loci, which was accompanied by loss of H3K9me2 or DNA methylation. The role of TOP1α in RdDM could be attributed to its promotion of Pol V, but not Pol IV, transcription to generate long noncoding RNAs."

However, their gating mechanism is still not fully understood. The crystallographic structure of the ASIC1 protein provides a clue, but the dynamics of the channel remains to be elucidated. Using computational biology, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophysiological recordings, we investigated the dynamics of ASIC1 gating. Through “normal mode analysis,” we detected a series of collective motions between the beta turn and transmembrane domain, and between the thumb and finger domains, suggesting a deformation pathway related to channel gating. The intrinsic rotation of the extracellular domain and the collective motions between the thumb and finger domains that are induced by proton binding serve to deform the channel from the extracellular to the transmembrane domain, triggering a “twist-to-open” motion of the channel pore. The relationship between the dynamics and the gating mechanism was experimentally confirmed by a series of complementary mutations in ASIC1 and electrophysiological measurements. Our study also indicated that the likely position of the channel gate is around Leu440 within the ASIC1 protein. We propose a clear model correlating the structural dynamics of ASIC1 and its gating mechanism."

Here, we show for the first time that the specific regulation of expression in response to UV of two NER factors CSA and HR23A is required to efficiently remove DNA lesions and to maintain genomic stability. We also implicate the USF-1 transcription factor in the regulation of the expression of these factors using in vitro and in vivo models. This finding is particularly important because UV is the major cause of skin cancers and dramatically compromises patients with highly sensitive genetic diseases."

For subsequent lipid assembly to be possible in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), export of these fatty acids across the chloroplast envelope membranes is required. The mechanism of this transport until now has not been known. We isolated FAX1 (fatty acid export 1), a novel membrane protein in chloroplast inner envelopes. FAX1 function is crucial for biomass production, male fertility, and the synthesis of fatty acid-derived compounds like lipids, waxes, or cell wall material of pollen grains. Whereas ER-derived lipids decreased when FAX1 was missing, levels of plastid-produced lipids increased. FAX1 over-expressing mutants showed the opposite behavior, including an increase of triacyglycerol oils. Because FAX1 could complement for fatty acid transport in yeast, we concluded that FAX1 mediates the export of free fatty acids from chloroplasts. In vertebrates, FAX1 relatives are structurally related proteins of so-far unknown function in mitochondria. This protein family may thus represent a powerful tool not only to increase lipid oil and biofuel production in plants but also to explore novel transport systems in animals."

Although past theoretical and empirical work indicated that green-beard effects rarely operate in nature, our new theory shows why this conclusion may have to be reevaluated. We integrate modeling analysis with extant empirical work to show that the unique properties of sex chromosomes can lead to a previously unappreciated form of sexual conflict (sexually antagonistic zygotic drive) that may be widespread in nature. It operates through harmful epigenetic parental effects, asymmetrical allocation of parental investment to sons and daughters, and asymmetrical interactions between brothers and sisters. Sexually antagonistic zygotic drive is functionally analogous to meiotic drive except that it operates due to competition among opposite-sex siblings rather than between competing gametes."

Although LINEs had been considered as “junk” DNA, recent studies have suggested that the LINE-induced alterations of host chromosomes are a major driving force for eukaryotic genome evolution. LINEs mobilize via a mechanism called retrotransposition, in which transcribed LINE RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA that is then integrated into the host chromosome. Although the role of LINE-encoded proteins in retrotransposition has been revealed, the participation of host-encoded proteins has not been well investigated. Here, using knockout chicken DT40 cell lines, we present genetic evidence that the host-encoded proteins involved in repair of DNA double-strand breaks participate in LINE retrotransposition. More precise characterization of LINE insertions in DT40 cells suggested dual roles for these host DNA repair proteins in LINE retrotransposition; one function is required for efficient integration of LINEs and the other restricts their full-length formation."

High-risk individuals may be entered into clinical trails, pre-clinical intervention strategies, or increased frequency of screening to detect early disease onset. However, the contribution of any one genetic variant to increase disease susceptibility is typically small, with many potential causal variants in the genomic region associated with risk. Therefore, it is important to understand the biological mechanisms by which the variants within a genetic region influence disease susceptibility by refining the set of all variants to those that are highly plausible to be causal. Herein, we describe a method to integrate molecular genomics data with genetic epidemiological data to inform on the underlying molecular mechanisms that influence breast cancer risk. This approach identifies the important transcription factors that directly regulate gene expression to modulate disease susceptibility."

To begin to address this critical problem, we test the hypothesis that genes accelerated in their rate of evolution in humans, as compared with other primates and mammals, are involved in birth timing. We first show that human gestational length has been altered relative to other non-human primates and mammals. Using allometric scaling, we demonstrate that human gestation is shorter than predicted based upon gestational length in other mammalian species. Next, we show that genes with rate acceleration in humans—in coding or regulatory regions—are plausible candidates to be involved in birth timing. Finally, we find that polymorphisms in the human accelerated gene (FSHR), not before implicated in the timing for birth, may alter risk for human preterm birth. Our understanding of pathways for birth timing in humans is limited, yet its elucidation remains one of the most important issues in biology and medicine. The evolutionary genetic approach that we apply should be applicable to many human disorders and assist other investigators studying preterm birth."

Lesion mimic mutants exhibit spontaneous HR-like cell death without pathogen invasion and are ideal genetic materials for dissecting the PCD pathway. In this study, we characterized the lesion mimic gene OsDRP1E that negatively regulates plant PCD through the control of cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

This threat is largely due to the ability of the influenza virus to undergo rapid changes, allowing it to escape from immune responses elicited by previous infections or vaccinations. Certain internal determinants of the influenza virus are largely conserved across different viral strains and represent attractive targets for potential “universal” influenza vaccines. Here, we demonstrated that cross-subtype protection against the influenza virus could be obtained through simultaneous priming of multiple arms of the immune response against conserved elements of the influenza virus. These results suggest a novel strategy that could potentially form a primary component of a universal influenza vaccine capable of providing long-lasting protection."

However, the pathways that initiate and amplify this pathological neuroinflammation are not well understood. As susceptibility to cerebral malaria is variable and has been shown to be partially heritable, we have studied this from a genetic perspective using a mouse model of infection with P. berghei which induces experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Here we show that mice bearing mutations in the myeloid transcription factor IRF8 and its heterodimerization partner IRF1 are completely resistant to ECM. We have identified the genes and associated networks that are activated by IRF8 during ECM. Loss-of-function mutations of several IRF8 targets are also shown to be protective. Parallel analysis of lungs infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis show that IRF8-associated core pathways are also engaged during tuberculosis where they play a protective role. This contrast illustrates the balancing act required by the immune system to respond to pathogens and highlights a lynchpin role for IRF8 in both. Finally, several genes in these networks have been individually associated with chronic or acute inflammatory conditions in humans."

One possibility is that these activities provide protection in the form of reserve, facilitating the maintenance of cognitive function in the face of cumulative brain damage.It is, however, still largely unknown how the risk of dementia is shaped by various reserve-stimulating lifestyle factors simultaneously taking place throughout the entire life course.Our study was designed to examine the association between the risk of dementia occurrence after age 75 and engagement in a variety of reserve-enhancing activities over the entire life course.We estimated the risk of dementia occurrence in a cohort of individuals aged 75 y and older conditional on their engagement in ten activities that were expected to promote reserve in three stages over the life course.We found that, on its own, engagement in early-, adulthood-, and late-life reserve-enhancing activities was associated with a reduced risk of dementia. However, when all three factors were simultaneously evaluated for their association with dementia, the effects of early-life and adulthood factors were attenuated. This could be due to the strong correlation between early-life and adulthood factors, whereas the late-life factor was only moderately related to either early-life or adulthood markers of reserve.An important finding was that increased frequency of engagement in stimulating activities over the life course was associated with a progressively reduced risk of dementia, suggesting a dose-response effect between life-course reserve and dementia risk. This effect appeared to operate irrespective of genetic predisposition to dementia.These findings strongly suggest that development of dementia is a lifelong process that begins decades before the onset of the disease.At the same time, it is never too late to initiate interventions aimed at risk modifying, since late-life engagement in stimulating activities was associated with a lower risk of dementia.However, because reserve-enhancing activities are correlated over the life course, and because the lowest risk is enjoyed by individuals with increased frequency of stimulating engagements, the most effective strategies are likely to be those emphasizing risk reduction throughout the entire life course."

We found that it is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism in the cell. FLCN normally binds and blocks the action of another protein (AMPK), which is involved in the maintenance of energy levels. When energy levels fall, AMPK is activated and drives a recycling pathway called autophagy, where cellular components are recycled producing energy. In the absence of FLCN in worms and mammalian cells, like in tumors of BHD patients, AMPK and autophagy are chronically activated leading to an increased energy level, which makes the cells/organism very resistant to many stresses that would normally kill them, which in the end could lead to progression of tumorigenesis."

In this manuscript, we report that the most extensively studied EPEC effector, Tir, possesses a potent and specific ability to inhibit the cytokine, TNFα from activating NF-κB. Moreover, this finding leads to the discovery of a novel inhibitory mechanism relating to the induced degradation of the TNFα Receptor-Associated Factor (TRAF) adaptor protein.

This may be due in part to this virus' ability to inflict specific damage to its host's DNA, combined with the disruption of an infected cell's ability to repair damage. Earlier studies found that components of the cell's repair machinery were differentially associated with the HCMV viral replication centers in the nucleus. Experiments here extend this observation to include components of the machinery involved in UV lesion repair. We hypothesized that association of components of the DNA repair machinery within the viral replication centers could favor the repair of viral DNA, but more importantly, be detrimental to the repair of cellular DNA. Infected cells were irradiated and examined for repair by three different methods. In the course of this study, we developed a new technique allowing simultaneous evaluation of both the viral and host genomes in an infected cell. These experiments found rapid, selective removal of UV lesions from the viral and not the cellular DNA within infected cells. Our results indicate the differential association of certain cellular repair proteins with this virus may have far-reaching implications in the disease pathogenesis of HCMV infection."

The unique functions of the thymus are mediated by a diverse array of specialized epithelial cells found only within this organ. These specialized, functionally mature thymic epithelial cells are generated from immature epithelial progenitor cells present in the fetal and adult thymus through a highly regulated process, termed differentiation, that is tightly controlled by specific genes. Foxn1, a protein that is expressed in thymic epithelial cells, is a transcription factor—a protein that regulates how other genes are expressed. Here, we have investigated the role of Foxn1 in generating mature thymic epithelial cells from immature progenitors. We find that Foxn1 is required throughout this process, from the onset of differentiation in progenitor thymic epithelial cells in the developing fetus to the final differentiation steps through which thymic epithelial cells mature to acquire their full functionality. We further find that Foxn1 controls the expression of a variety of genes with different functions in thymic epithelial cells. Overall, our study defines the role of Foxn1 in thymus development at the cellular level and provides insight into how it mediates these functions."

A total of 490 schoolchildren (163 from Kenya and 327 from Tanzania) aged 9–11 years living along the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania provided data on S. mansoni and malaria infections, weight, height, anaemia and physical fitness. The pupils in Tanzania had lower prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection compared to pupils in Kenya, but more had malaria parasites in their blood. In addition, Tanzanian pupils were taller and heavier, fewer were anaemic and they scored higher in a physical fitness test. Questionnaire data showed that more of the Tanzanian pupils knew where to wash hands after toilet visits, and more consumed animal protein (mostly fish protein) for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Multivariable analyses revealed that eating animal protein and knowing where to wash hands after toilet visits were significant predictors for haemoglobin levels and physical fitness. These results suggest that the differences in morbidity parameters may be affected by factors other than S. mansoni infection alone. Diet and hygiene practices seem to contribute to the health status of schoolchildren along Lake Victoria in Kenya and Tanzania."

The chronic evolution is associated with the selection of autoreactive CD8+ T cells with higher T cell receptor avidity, whereas those with lower avidity undergo prompt contraction, as seen in patients undergoing infection resolution. We suggest that these autoreactive responses are secondary to the viral persistence and can participate to the HCV-related immunopathology. This data has implications for the prognosis and therapy of infections undergoing chronic evolution."

This repertoire, or transcriptome, is established by the coordinated activity of transcription factors and cofactors that form modular transcription complexes. The modular nature of transcription complexes complicates our understanding of how transcription factors shape the transcriptome. CHIP/LDB transcription complexes direct formation of various cell types including blood and nerve cells. CHIP/LDB malfunction leads to developmental defects and cancer. The function of these complexes depends critically on the docking of specific transcription factors and co-factors at a specific time and in a specific cell type, making them outstanding models for intricate transcriptional regulation. Here we demonstrate that loss of SSDP, a key regulatory component of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes, alters transcription of a large group of genes. We used bioinformatics tools and genetic tests to examine the function of additional components of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes and their target genes during the development of specific organs. We demonstrate how differences in the availability of transcription factors in different cells can affect the function and composition of CHIP/LDB transcription complexes."

However, bacteria do occasionally have sex in the form of homologous recombination by taking up external DNA and incorporating it into their genomes. This happens far less regularly than sexual reproduction happens in human generations but is a known way that bacteria undergo ‘Horizontal gene transfer’. This means that genes can be acquired without being inherited. In this study we show that this form of horizontal gene transfer is more likely to happen in certain environments over others in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In particular, we show that this is more likely to happen in environments that closely mirror the nasopharynx which is the natural habitat of S. pneumoniae."

Microsporidia are very common microbes that cause disease in all animals, including roundworms, insects, fish and people. We investigated microsporidia infection in the roundworm C. elegans, and found that strains from diverse parts of the world have differing levels of resistance against infection. Interestingly, a C. elegans strain from Hawaii can clear infection but only during the earliest stage of life. This resistance appears to be evolutionarily important, because it is during this early stage of life when infection can greatly reduce the number of progeny produced by the host. Consistent with this idea, if the Hawaiian strain is infected when young, it will ultimately produce more progeny than a susceptible strain of C. elegans. We find that this early life resistance of Hawaiian animals is due to a combination of genetic regions, which together provide enhanced immunity against a natural pathogen, thus enabling this strain to have more offspring."

The food-borne pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis can cause persistent infection in mice. Upon infection, Y. pseudotuberculosis passes the anti-microbial gastrointestinal milieu and finally remains associated with lymphoid follicles in cecal tissue surrounded by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, indicating that the bacteria are exposed to multiple environmental cues. We performed complex RNA-seq of small cecal biopsies of infected mice to reveal Y. pseudotuberculosis gene expression in vivo. We found that Y. pseudotuberculosis underwent reprogramming from a virulent phenotype, expressing virulence genes during early infection, to an adapted phenotype capable of persisting in the harsh cecal environment. Persistence was characterized by a novel expression pattern with down-regulation of virulence genes and up-regulation of genes involved in anaerobiosis, chemotaxis, and protection against oxidative and acidic stress. Mutagenesis of selected genes revealed that the regulator rovA was critical for the establishment of infection, and that arcA, fnr, frdA, and wrbA play critical roles in maintaining infection for long periods of time. Our study shows the power of RNA deep sequencing, which can be used to reveal the in vivo expression patterns of small amounts of bacteria in complex intestinal environments."

When a large cholera outbreak occurs, the disease appears briefly on the radar of public attention. Some unfortunate populations around the world suffer recurrent episodes of cholera but their plight goes unnoticed. We established cholera surveillance in impoverished areas in Jakarta (Indonesia), Kolkata (India), and Beira (Mozambique) where the disease is known to occur regularly. The cholera burden was calculated using the site population as the denominator and the number of cholera cases as the numerator. The lowest overall rate was in Jakarta with 0.5 cases per 1000 population per year. The incidence was three times higher in Kolkata (1.6/1000/year) and eight times higher in Beira (4.0/1000/year), adding to the growing impression of the large cholera problem in Africa. In all sites, children are the most affected. Estimates such as these are useful when considering where and among whom interventions against the disease are most needed. Improvement of water supply and sanitation is the best strategy against cholera and other diarrheal diseases but may not be achievable in these impoverished areas in the near future. Other immediate, short- to medium-term strategies such as vaccination against cholera may be useful."

Temperature may play an important role because it affects virus transmission by mosquitoes, through its effects on mosquito development, survival, reproduction, and biting rates as well as the rate at which mosquitoes acquire and transmit viruses. Here, we measure the impact of temperature on transmission by two of the most common mosquito vector species for these viruses, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We integrate data from several laboratory experiments into a mathematical model of temperature-dependent transmission, and find that transmission peaks at 26–29°C and can occur between 18–34°C. Statistically comparing model predictions with recent observed human cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika across the Americas suggests an important role for temperature, and supports model predictions. Using the model, we predict that most of the tropics and subtropics are suitable for transmission in many or all months of the year, but that temperate areas like most of the United States are only suitable for transmission for a few months during the summer (even if the mosquito vector is present)."

With the identification of Rig I and Mda5, two RNA helicases were shown to serve as pivotal receptors of viral RNA. Subsequently, a considerable number of RNA helicases were proposed to function as sensors or signal transducers for both microbial RNA and DNA. X-chromosome-encoded RNA helicase DDX3X was discovered as an interactor of the S/T kinase TBK1 which regulates the production of type I Interferons (IFN-I). However, the importance of DDX3X for innate immunity in an organismic context remained elusive. Here we describe and analyze mice lacking DDX3X in hematopoietic cells. We show contributions of DDX3X to hematopoiesis and a striking loss in resistance against Listeria monocytogenes. Our data reveal that DDX3X is critically involved in enhancing the expression of numerous antimicrobial genes. Consistently, production of important cytokines such as IL12 or IFNγ is reduced. Furthermore, DDX3X-deficient macrophages show reduced ability to restrict L. monocytogenes growth. Owing to partial redundancy with its close Y-chromosomal homologue, DDX3Y, the observed effects differ between mouse sexes. Thus, DDX3X may contribute to sex differences in immunity to pathogens and inflammatory disease."

We have recently identified antiviral PML (promyelocytic leukemia) nuclear cages that sequester VZV nucleocapsids and inhibit formation of infectious particles. Here we developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) imaging and reconstruction strategy, termed Serial Section Array-Scanning Electron Microscopy (SSA-SEM) that together with electron tomography made it possible to derive 3D reconstructions of complete herpesvirus infected host cell nuclei and of PML cages with ultrastructural precision for the first time. We determined the 3D distribution of several thousand nucleocapsids within reconstructed volumes of single host cell nuclei and in PML cages as well as their sequestration efficiency and sequestration capacity: more than 98% of nucleocapsids were entrapped within PML cages and individual PML cages could sequester nearly 3,000 nucleocapsids which were cross-linked by an irregular electron-dense meshwork within the PML cages. This 3D analysis provides a proof of concept for using SSA-SEM to investigate virion assembly at the whole cell level and further elucidates our observation that PML cages are antiviral nuclear domains which block VZV nucleocapsid egress from the infected cell nucleus."

The current LF elimination program is focused on administering anti-filarial drugs to the entire at-risk population via annual mass drug administration (MDA). While the MDA program is proving effective in many areas, other areas may require augmentative measures such as vector control. An example of the latter is provided by some regions of the South Pacific where Aedes polynesiensis is the primary vector. Here, we describe a novel vector control approach based upon naturally occurring Wolbachia bacterial infections. Wolbachia are endosymbiotic intracellular bacteria that cause a form of sterility known as cytoplasmic incompatibility. We show that introgression crosses with mosquitoes that are infected with a different Wolbachia type results in an A. polynesiensis strain (designated ‘CP’) that is incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes. No difference in mating competitiveness is observed between CP males and wild type males in laboratory assays. The results support continued development of the strategy as a tool to improve public health."

Within aggressive tumors cancer stem cells with low tumorigenic potential may be isolated. Simulations of our model suggest that the cells harvested in core needle biopsies represent less than 10% of the phenotypic heterogeneity of the total tumor population.

Because they extend from the surface of the cell, type IV pili are very good candidates for drug targeting. Computer simulation was used to exert forces on a segment of one of these filaments, in an effort to mimic the effects of tension that would be experienced by the pilus upon binding during infection. Regions of the filament that become exposed to the external environment in the pulled state were determined, in an attempt to identify amino acid sequences that could act as targets for drug design."

Maintaining the balance between myoblast proliferation and differentiation is crucial for proper regeneration, with disruption leading to impaired regeneration characteristic of muscle-wasting diseases. Our study highlights the important role the Runx1 transcription factor plays in muscle regeneration and in regulating the balance between muscle stem cell proliferation and differentiation. While not expressed in healthy muscle tissue, Runx1 level significantly increases in response to various types of muscle damage. This aligns with our finding that mice lacking Runx1 in their muscles suffer from impaired muscle regeneration. Their muscles contained a significantly low number of regenerating myofibers, which were also relatively smaller in size, resulting in loss of muscle mass and motor capabilities. Our results indicate that Runx1 regulates muscle regeneration by preventing premature differentiation of proliferating myoblasts, thereby facilitating the buildup of the myoblast pool required for proper regeneration. Through genome-wide gene-expression analysis we identify a set of Runx1-regulated genes responsible for muscle regeneration thereby implicating Runx1 in the pathology of muscle wasting diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

We show that the T3SS effector SpvD targets the NF-ĸB pathway by interfering with nuclear translocation of p65. SpvD interacts with the exportin Xpo2. Perturbation of Xpo2 disrupts recycling of importin-α from the nucleus, leading to abrogation of p65 nuclear translocation.

NTDs commonly lead to costly lifelong disabilities. They are considered to be caused by a combination of nutritional, inherited and environmental factors, and their interactions. However, an obvious mechanism is currently unknown. Genetic studies in human populations are made difficult by the multifactorial nature of NTDs and because multiple cases within a single family are rare. Animal models are helpful in dissecting the genetics of such complex traits; however existing rodent models do not explain all of the NTD cases in humans. Dogs are excellent biomedical models for humans since they receive comparable medical care, share our home environment, and develop naturally occurring diseases comparable to those in humans. We used a naturally occurring NTD in Weimaraner dogs, termed spinal dysraphism, to identify a mutation in an associated regulatory gene, NKX2-8. Mutations in NKX2-8 were subsequently documented in human patients with a generally similar NTD termed spina bifida. This is the first documented evidence that NKX2-8 has a role in NTDs. It is expected that this discovery will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms leading to NTDs."

Over past decades, many national programs have implemented regular drug treatment to control or prevent the advanced complications of Schistosoma infection. However, these periodic treatments do not stop transmission of the parasite, which occurs when human sewage contaminates local water bodies and parasite eggs infect intermediate host snails. In this systematic review, we collated past experience of using chemically-mediated snail control for prevention of schistosomiasis. This approach, used in many Schistosoma-affected countries before the advent of the current oral drug regimens, has the potential to significantly reduce transmission if properly applied. Our meta-analysis of 63 studies (performed 1953–1981) catalogued a wide variety of water treatments and schedules employed. Among studies reporting on human infection, we found that snail control reduced local human prevalence and incidence of infection in most, but not all locations. Estimates from the aggregated studies indicate that snail control (alone) typically reduced new infections by 64% and local prevalence declined over a period of years. This decline was accelerated and more profound (84% reduction) if drug treatment was also made available."

The study of CMV in animal models has helped understand the pathogenic consequences of CMV infection and adds substantial understanding of the complex interplay of host and virus in living systems. Natural Killer (NK) cells have emerged as an important player during CMV infection trough their specific recognition of viral particles determinants and subsequent secretion of cytokines and cytolytic granules. In the present study, we have generated different mouse models to specifically investigate quantify viral recognition and cytokine expression by NK cells during CMV infection as a measure of NK cell function. We found that even after proper recognition of infected cells by NK cells, the adequate production of IFNγ is crucial to restrain viral infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that IFNγ production by NK cells is genetically determined and directly linked to the IFNγ locus. Hence, we provide the first evidence for of a unique mechanism of IFNγ production by NK cells which regulates susceptibility to viral infection."

Drosophila DJ-1 mutants are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and UV irradiation, and oxidative stress-induced cell death is significantly increased in dopaminergic neurons. In this study, we characterized a Drosophila homologue of death domain-associated protein (Daxx), Daxx-like protein (DLP), as a key player in the process of the oxidative stress-induced cell death in DJ-1 mutants. Upon oxidative stress, DLP expression was increased in the DJ-1 mutants, and locomotive defects and oxidative stress-induced phenotypes including apoptosis and lethality were dramatically rescued by DLP deficiency. More interestingly, we revealed that Drosophila forkhead box subgroup O was required for the increased DLP expression in DJ-1 mutants. Additionally, Drosophila DJ-1 suppressed DLP and Daxx translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol in both fly brain and mammalian cells. Interestingly, targeted expression of Drosophila DJ-1 to mitochondria efficiently inhibited Daxx translocation. Our results show that Drosophila DJ-1 protects dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stresses by regulating the subcellular localization and gene expression of DLP, providing a clue to understanding the molecular mechanism underlying oxidative stress-induced neuronal death in PD."

Our computer simulations show that even when all cells have identical mutation and growth rates, testing bulk samples frequently leads to spurious detection of rate differences. This can lead to false conclusions about the causes and progress of cancer. We discuss possible solutions involving either genetic testing of single cells or the use of computer algorithms to detect rare mutations within a sample."

In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to identify genes that were differentially expressed upon HTLV-1 infection and immortalization of primary T cells. We found that IL-17RB, the receptor for the IL-25 cytokine, was highly induced in HTLV-1 transformed T cells and was required for NF-κB activation, cell proliferation and survival. Tax induced the expression of IL-17RB and established a positive feedback loop together with IL-25 that triggered persistent NF-κB activation and the upregulation of IL-9 and other genes critical for T-cell proliferation and survival. IL-17RB was also overexpressed in a subset of acute ATL patient specimens and therefore may potentially be targeted by monoclonal antibodies as a novel ATL therapy."

We show that an alcoholic extract prepared from Cissampelos pareira Linn inhibited the replication of dengue viruses in living cells in culture and protected mice against dengue infection. It also showed antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. Importantly, this extract did not show any toxic effects in rats and did not affect platelets and red blood cells.

Understanding the mechanisms through which cooperative, socially optimal, behavior can be established in social dilemmas is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology and in many areas of the social sciences. Here we study how cooperative behavior can emerge in three key social dilemmas—known as the donation game, snowdrift game and sculling game—when interactions between individuals form a network. We show that in all three social dilemmas significantly higher levels of cooperative behavior typically emerge in such a situation as compared to what would be the case in the absence of any network structure. In particular, we show that certain structural properties that are common in real-world social networks have a significant effect in increasing the level of cooperative behavior that is present in all three social dilemmas."

NOS2, which synthesizes nitric oxide, regulates numerous important activities, including resistance to infectious organisms, tumor development, and autoimmune diseases. It also competes with the enzyme Arginase-1 (Arg1) for the common substrate L-arginine. However, the role CAT2 in the regulation of Arg1 activity has not been previously examined. Therefore, we infected CAT2-deficient mice with the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni or with the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, two organisms that trigger highly divergent host immune responses. Strikingly, following infection with S. mansoni, CAT2−/− mice developed parasite egg–induced lesions in the liver that were 3 to 4 times larger than wild type and hepatic fibrosis (a feature of severe schistosomiasis) was exacerbated, indicating a general worsening of disease in the absence of CAT2. The CAT2−/− mice were also more susceptible to T. gondii infection, demonstrating that CAT2 is critical for the development of protective cell-mediated immunity. Thus, these studies identify CAT2 as a powerful regulator of host immune responses, which may have major implications for a variety of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases."

The potent cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities of mycolactones lead to severe destruction of the subcutaneous fat tissue with minimal inflammation in the core of the lesion. Due to the lipid-like nature of mycolactones, the production of antibodies against these molecules has so far been unsuccessful. By using the classical approach of fusing immortal cells with spleen cells of mice immunized with a protein conjugate of a truncated non-toxic synthetic mycolactone, we were able to generate hybridoma cells producing mycolactone-specific monoclonal antibodies. Mammalian cell-based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that these antibodies have neutralizing activity and can fully block the cytotoxic activity of mycolactone, resulting in survival of the target cells. These findings support the concept to target mycolactone by a vaccine. Furthermore, the anti-mycolactone antibodies may represent useful tools for BU diagnostics development."

Recently, kinetic models of metabolism have re-emerged as a means for characterizing metabolism, offering improvements over their stoichiometric counterparts in both the type of information that can be gleaned from them, and in prediction accuracy. Despite recent developments, a lack of raw experimental data needed for flux elucidation and, subsequently, kinetic parameterization, and high computation cost have prevented the development of a uniform workflow for construction of the most informative kinetic models.

Existing treatments are now becoming less effective due to the emergence of drug resistance. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms used by the parasite to adapt to drugs and achieve resistance is crucial for developing future treatment strategies. Unfortunately, the biological mechanism whereby Leishmania acquires drug resistance is poorly understood. Recent years have brought new technologies with the potential to increase greatly our understanding of drug resistance mechanisms. The latest mass spectrometry techniques allow the metabolome of parasites to be studied rapidly and in great detail. We have applied this approach to determine the metabolome of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant parasites isolated from patients with leishmaniasis. The data show that there are wholesale differences between the isolates and that the membrane composition has been drastically modified in drug-resistant parasites compared with drug-sensitive parasites. Our findings demonstrate that untargeted metabolomics has great potential to identify major metabolic differences between closely related parasite strains and thus should find many applications in distinguishing parasite phenotypes of clinical relevance."

Factors that control alternative splicing bind to RNA sequence motifs in the exon or flanking introns and guide tissue and developmental specific splicing events. CUGBP2 is a dual functional regulator of alternative splicing that can cause inclusion or skipping of a target exon, depending on the context of its binding motifs. Previously, the mechanisms of regulation by this protein and the positional significance of its target motifs have not been characterized. In this study, the authors dissected the mechanism of exon skipping by CUGBP2 and demonstrate that a specific configuration of motifs at the perimeters of a functional reference point are intimately involved in this event. Furthermore, this mechanism of regulation is shown to have general significance because novel CUGBP2 target exons contain a similar arrangement of motifs. The most interesting of this group is an exon within the CUGBP2 transcript itself. This study underscores the importance of a functional reference point in the specificity of regulation by an alternative splicing factor and reveals a novel autoregulatory role for CUGBP2."

However, persistent activation of NF-κB leads to chronic inflammation, autoimmunity and malignancy. Infection with the human retrovirus HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia, and HTLV-1 Tax-mediated persistent NF-κB activation is crucial for leukemogenesis. Therefore, a better understanding of the precise mechanism underlying aberrant NF-κB activation is essential to develop new therapeutic approaches. Ubiquitination is one of the major post-translational modifications that regulate various intracellular signaling pathways. We and others have shown that Tax activates NF-κB through activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex by generating Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Tax-induced IKK activation remains less well understood. Here, we demonstrate precisely how HTLV-1 Tax utilizes the ubiquitin system to activate the IKK complex. The IKK complex-associated Lys63/Met1-linked hybrid polyubiquitin chains are generated through the Tax-mediated recruitment of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to the IKK complex. Furthermore, the hybrid chains are required for the Tax-induced formation of the active macromolecular IKK complex. Accordingly, we propose a novel model in which Tax triggers Lys63/Met1-linked hybrid-chain-dependent oligomerization of the IKK complex, leading to trans-autophosphorylation-mediated IKK activation."

In reality, humans are vaccinated or respond to infection in the context of a life-time of accumulated exposure to multiple, systemic infections and other vaccines, some of which are themselves attenuated live organisms. This is even more pronounced in areas that are endemic for infectious diseases. We wished to examine the impact infectious history can have on the immune response against infection and the efficacy of vaccination. To do this, we used two classes of pathogens that model clinically important invasive infections. One pathogen is the bacterium, Salmonella Typhimurium against which we have also developed an experimental porin vaccine, and the second is an invasive helminth, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, that models aspects of hookworm infections. Our studies indicate that exposure to a second, unrelated pathogen can reduce the efficiency of immunity generated during natural infection and immunity generated after vaccination. These results are important as they help to identify potential strategies for improving immune-mediated control of infection and the success of vaccination in infection-endemic regions."

Meiotic partner chromosomes establish exclusive associations via a patterned distribution of crossover recombination events. During the maturation of recombination intermediates into crossovers, homologous axes are aligned in the context of a striking proteinaceous structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC). While genetic data link the SC with crossovers, it is unclear whether the mature SC structure facilitates crossover formation. Here we describe an interspecies complementation experiment in which we replace the S. cerevisiae version of an SC structural protein with an ancestrally related version from K. lactis. Our experiment reveals that, while SC proteins are required, mature full-length SC is dispensable for the formation of SC-associated crossovers in budding yeast. We furthermore discovered that most, but not all, members of a conserved meiotic crossover pathway are required for the crossovers that form in this interspecies context. Our findings strengthen the notion that a primary function of many SC proteins is to facilitate crossover recombination, independent of a role in building the larger SC structure. Furthermore, these data suggest that during normal meiosis in S. cerevisiae the assembled SC may act to functionally couple key crossover recombination proteins to one another."

Changes in expression levels or the amino acid sequences of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transporters have frequently been implicated in ML resistance, but direct evidence for transport of MLs by nematode Pgps is still missing. Here, cloning of pgp-9 of the equine parasite Cylicocyclus elongatus and its functional recombinant expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain deficient in seven endogenous ABC transporters is described. Expression decreased susceptibility to several fungicidal mammalian Pgp substrates including e.g. actinomycin D and ketoconazole, but had no influence on susceptibility to the benzimidazole thiabendazole, which is active against both, yeasts and nematodes. Addition of some MLs strongly increased ketoconazole susceptibility in yeasts expressing C. elongatus Pgp-9, while other MLs had no effect. These interactions are a strong hint that some MLs act as substrates or at least as inhibitors of Pgp-9 mediated drug transport."

The difficult diagnosis lead to an underreporting of infection rates. Strongyloidiasis can easily be misdiagnosed because many infections remain asymptomatic and the lack of sensitivity of the conventional fecal-based techniques for morphologically identification of infective larvae in feces. Although serologic tests are useful, a limitation in standardization to avoid cross-reactions still remains. There is an urgent need to improve more sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly in immunocompromised patients or candidates to immunosuppressive treatments. Several molecular approaches for Strongyloides spp. DNA detection have already been assayed, but they have a very limited use in routine diagnostic, particularly in endemic areas. In addition, all molecular approaches for Strongyloides spp. DNA detection have always been mainly assayed for stool samples and no other more advantageous biological samples, such as urine, have been investigated for molecular purposes. In this study we have developed, for the first time, a molecular assay using LAMP methodology as a simple, sensible and robust method for the detection of S. venezuelensis DNA in a well-established Wistar rats experimental infection in both stool and urine samples. The LAMP assay was also successfully evaluated in patients´ stool samples. Our LAMP assay (Strong-LAMP) is an useful molecular tool in a strongyloidiasis experimental infection model and could be a potential field-friendly diagnostic test in a clinical setting, following further validation."

The regulation of inflammatory responses to schistosome eggs trapped in tissues is critical for host survival and is established before egg deposition begins, with the production of the cytokine IL-4 being a hallmark of this process. Here we show that regulation of inflammatory responses also contributes to the development of schistosomes into egg-laying adult parasites. We demonstrate that failure of schistosome development in immunodeficient mice correlates with the absence of the chronic liver inflammation and subsequent immune regulation found in infected wild type mice. Restoration of liver inflammation in immunodeficient mice by repeated administration of liver toxins restored parasite development. Repeated administration of an endogenous inflammatory stimulus also restored parasite development, and also restored aspects of the immune regulation found in wild type mice. Finally, administration of IL-4 alone to immunodeficient animals also restored parasite development and the regulation of inflammation. We propose that schistosomes require immune regulation of inflammation to develop in the hostile immune environment within their hosts. Hence, targeting regulation of inflammation may represent a novel approach to treating or preventing schistosome infections."

In insects, RNAi regulates endogenous genes and functions as an RNA-based immune system against viral infection. Here we have uncovered details of how RNAi is triggered by RNA viruses. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) generated as a replication intermediate or from transcription of the RNA virus can be used as substrate for the biogenesis of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). Unlike other dsRNAs, virus RNA processing involves Dicer but not its canonical partner protein Loqs-PD. Thus, vsiRNA biogenesis is mechanistically different from biogenesis of endogenous siRNAs or siRNAs derived from other exogenous RNA sources. Our results suggest a specialization of the pathway dedicated to silencing of RNA viruses versus other types of RNAi silencing. The understanding of RNAi mechanisms during viral infection could have implications for the control of insect-borne viruses and the use of siRNAs to treat viral infections in humans."

How the E2F-DP transcription factor heterodimer, the pocket protein, and the highly conserved MuvB complex coalesce on chromatin and repress DREAM target genes has yet to be determined. We directly tested the prevailing model that the DREAM pocket protein links E2F-DP to MuvB and is required for gene repression. Using a protein null mutant of the sole C. elegans pocket protein LIN-35, we demonstrate that the pocket protein indeed links E2F-DP and MuvB, which aids in the stable occupancy of DREAM components near target genes. Depletion of additional DREAM components in lin-35 null worms revealed that the remaining chromatin-bound MuvB represses target genes. We conclude that the MuvB subcomplex mediates DREAM’s critical repressive function. Our functional genomics approach in the simplified C. elegans system reveals that the ancestral function of the pocket protein is to stabilize the innate repressive activity of MuvB, ensuring proper regulation of DREAM target genes through development."

Spatial risk profiling of dengue transmission is therefore necessary to ensure the optimal utilization of limited resources, and achieving maximum impact of dengue vector control. Here, we developed a dengue risk map by stratifying the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore. Random Forest was used to predict the risk rank of dengue transmission in 1km2 grids, and the predicted risk ranks are then categorized and mapped to color-coded risk groups.

Knowing the local parasite structure is useful for elimination efforts. Therefore, we analyzed, with a panel of 14 microsatellite markers, 234 P. vivax mono infections in blood samples collected from 4 communities in central Vietnam. Genetic diversity in the population was moderate; a high occurrence of polyclonal infections and significant linkage disequilibrium were detected, suggesting inbreeding or recombination between highly related haplotypes. In addition, both genetic differentiation and population structure was low and only detected between communities at each side of the river. Those results suggest gene flow between study communities with the river defining a moderate geographical barrier. Future studies should determine how this genetic variation is maintained in an area of extremely low transmission."

During infection suppression of p38 MAPK and activation of ERK1/2 MAPK have been acclaimed for survival and proliferation of these protozoan parasites. In this study, we show novel signaling pathways that interact with these MAPK that further contributes to determine the final fate of the disease. Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that binds to a family of G-protein coupled receptors known as S1P receptors. TDM infected with Leishmania donovani showed a decrease in the expression of S1PR1-3. Moreover, the enzyme that catalyzes S1P production, Sphingosine Kinase 1, showed decreased activation in a time-dependent fashion in infected cells. Furthermore, exogenously supplementation of S1P clears intracellular parasite burden by a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and IL-10 at mRNA and protein level. On the other hand, S1P induces anti-leishmanial response by activating p38 phosphorylation and IL-12 at mRNA as well as at protein level. To further gain insight on the receptors subtypes involved in the anti-leishmanial response, we specifically blocked S1PR2 and S1PR3. In this study, we found a tremendous increase in the parasite load as a result of increased IL-10 secretion and ERK1/2 phosphorylation on combination of these inhibitor doses. Taking together, our study thus suggested the possible involvement of S1PR2-3 during Leishmania donovani infection in human macrophages. These findings thus elaborate our knowledge in understanding the interaction of signaling intermediates during Leishmania infection which may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic interventions."

Such cell elimination is also observed during normal development in genetically-homogeneous tissues. In addition to the identification of key genes and molecular mechanisms related to these phenomena, the relevance of cell/tissue mechanics has been reported as a possible common mechanism of elimination. Here, we examined these mechanisms and possible functions of mechanical cell elimination (MCE) from the perspective of tissue growth efficiency and homeostasis. Using mechanical simulations of tissue growth processes, we identified key parameters of cellular mechanical/growth properties that determine elimination rates or cellular fitness (defined as the difference between cell division and elimination rate). Based on these results, we propose mechanical feedback mechanisms that could improve tissue growth efficiency and density/stress homeostasis. Furthermore, when cells with different mechanical traits are mixed, we found that MCE could drive a drastic shift in cell trait distribution, thereby improving tissue growth efficiency through the selection of cellular traits. With this, cell density, stress state, and phenotype were also shown to become homogenous. Our results will permit the elucidation of the mechanisms of intrinsic tissue defense against abnormal cells by their elimination through mechanical cell-cell interactions."

Recently we learned that different ligands targeting the same GPCR can elicit different biological responses, but the mechanisms remain unknown. We address this fundamental question for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, because it is known to respond to the binding of structurally diverse ligands by producing similar stimuli in the cell, and to the binding of quite similar ligands with dramatically different responses. Molecular dynamics simulations of molecular models of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in complex with pharmacologically distinct ligands show the dynamic rearrangements of the receptor molecule to be different for these ligands, and the nature and extents of the rearrangements reflect the known pharmacological properties of the ligands as full, partial or inverse activators of the receptor. The different rearrangements of the receptor molecule are shown to produce different rearrangements of the surrounding membrane, a remodeling of the environment that can have differential ligand-determined effects on receptor function and association in the cell's membrane."

DEN clinical manifestations range from mild febrile illness (dengue fever) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Epidemiological observations indicate that infants born to dengue immune mothers are at greater risk to develop the severe form of the disease (DHF/DSS) upon infection with any serotype of dengue virus (DENV). It was proposed that the presence of maternally acquired DENV specific antibodies cross react but fail to neutralize DENV particles, resulting in higher viremia that correlates with increased disease severity. Direct experimental evidence supporting this antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) hypothesis has been missing. Furthermore, a recent epidemiological report has challenged the influence of maternally acquired antibodies in disease outcome. Here, we have developed a mouse model of ADE where DENV2-infected mice born to DENV1 immune mothers displayed enhanced disease severity compared to DENV2-infected mice born to dengue naïve mothers. This is a long-overdue direct experimental evidence of the role of maternally acquired antibodies in dengue disease outcome. It provides a unique opportunity to dissect the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon."

About 7500 transcripts are differentially expressed in four sequential waves during the 72-h reproductive period in the fat body, a critical reproductive organ. The major regulators for these waves of gene expression are the two very important insect hormones, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and Juvenile hormone (JH), their respective receptors Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Methoprene-Tolerant (Met), amino acids and the orphan nuclear receptor HR3. These key regulators are responsible for activation and repression of co-regulated gene sets, at different time points, within the 72-h reproductive period.

Nevertheless, comparison of bacterial chromosomes from related genera revealed a conservation of genetic organization. Most bacterial genomes are circular molecules, and DNA replication proceeds bidirectionally from a single origin to an opposite region where replication forks meet. The replication process imprints the bacterial chromosome because initiation and termination at defined loci result in strand biases due to the mutational differences occurring during leading and lagging strands synthesis. We analyze the strength of different parameters that may limit genome plasticity. We show that the preferential positioning of essential genes on the leading strand, the proximity of genes involved in transcription and translation to the origin of replication on the leading strand, and the presence of biased motifs along the replichores operate only as long-term positive selection determinants. By contrast, selection operates to maintain replication arms of similar lengths. Finally, we demonstrate that spatial structuring of the chromosome impedes strongly genome plasticity. Genetic evidence supports the presence of two steps in the cell cycle controlled by the spatial organization of the chromosome."

It is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite is genetically diverse and classified into six main lineages. However, the relationship between intra-specific genetic diversity and clinical or epidemiological features is not clear, mainly because low sensitivity for direct typing on biological samples. For this reason, genetic markers with high copy number are required to achieve sensitivity. Here, we deep sequenced and analyzed a DNA region present in the large mitochondria of the parasite (named as mHVR, 105 copies per parasite) from strains belonging to the six main lineages in order to analyze mHVR diversity and to evaluate its usefulness for typing. Despite the high sequence diversity, strains of the same lineage shared more sequences than strains of different lineages. Curiously, hybrid lineages shared mHVR sequences with both parents suggesting that mHVR (and DNA minicircles from the mitochondria) are inherited from both parentals. The mHVR amplicon sequencing workflow proposed here is reproducible and, potentially, it would be useful for typing hundreds of biological samples at time. It also provides a valuable approach to perform evolutionary and functional studies."

The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu binds to tetherin, preventing its incorporation into viral particles, and targets it for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This involves mis-trafficking of tetherin by a Vpu-dependent mechanism through the engagement of clathrin adaptor proteins. Although structural evidence exists for Vpu and tetherin interacting with clathrin adaptor 1 (AP-1), evidence that it is required for Vpu-mediated tetherin counteraction is still lacking. Tetherin degradation by Vpu also requires an E3 ubiquitin ligase, SCFβTRCP1/2 that binds to phosphorylated serine residues in the Vpu cytoplasmic tail. Again, discrepancies exist about the importance of this interaction in tetherin’s counteraction. Here we show that Vpu phosphorylation, in combination with its physical interaction with tetherin, regulates interaction with both AP-1 and the other major cellular clathrin adaptor, AP-2. These interactions can be decoupled from SCFβTRCP1/2 recruitment, thus indicating clathrin-dependent mis-trafficking as a critical step in tetherin antagonism by Vpu. Additionally, the ability to interact both with AP-1 and AP-2 in a tetherin-dependent manner indicates a redundancy in host cofactors used by Vpu that explains disparate previous observations of its mechanism of action."

The enzyme consists of two subcomplexes called the F1 and FO sectors. The F1 sector is the site of ATP synthesis, while the FO sector couples proton translocation to the rotary motion of the enzyme. FO sector subunits also form the peripheral stalk (stator), which holds the nonrotating parts of the enzyme together. F1 sector subunits are highly conserved among eukaryotes, while most FO sector subunits appear to be diverse and remain unknown in many species, including in the important human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. In this study, we have partially purified the T. gondii F-type ATP synthase and analyzed its proteome, using mass spectrometry. This resulted in the identification of 20 novel subunits of the enzyme, including extremely diversified key FO sector subunits. Many of these novel T. gondii proteins are conserved in related apicomplexan parasites, such as the malaria parasite, and thus might be good drug targets. Conservation of many of these proteins in related free-living alveolate species provides insights on their evolutionary history and can potentially facilitate further biochemical and structural studies on this unusual enzyme."

We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (Mekk3), Wdr62, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (Jnk1) knockout (KO) mice have defects in the generation and maturation of neurons. We demonstrate that WDR62 stability is positively regulated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), MEKK3, but negatively regulated by the E3 ligase, F-box and WD repeat domain-containing protein 7 (FBW7). These positive and negative factors calibrate the strength of the activity of the JNK signaling pathway, which controls self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during brain development.

When these mutations occur in a protein-coding region of a genome, they can have a profound effect on the protein's function and ultimately on a health-related phenotype. Recently, a growing number of evidence suggests that many of SNPs reside on or near the protein regions that are required for the interactions with other proteins. Some of these SNPs could rewire the protein-protein interactions altering the functions of the protein interaction complexes, while other SNPs are neutral to the interactions. Understanding the effect of SNPs on the protein-protein interactions is a challenging problem to solve, both experimentally and computationally. Here, we leverage the machine learning methods by training a computational predictor to tell apart the mutations that are harmful to protein-protein interactions from those ones that are not. We use these tools in two case studies of mutations affecting the protein-protein interaction networks centered around the genes associated with breast cancer and diabetes."

We compared the activities of 8 different antivirals from 3 drug classes, including drugs repurposed for the treatment of Ebola: type I interferons and nucleoside analogs. Our data indicate that IFN-ß is a potent inhibitor of Ebola virus, contributing to the decision to conduct a clinical trial of IFN-ß treatment for Ebola virus disease in Guinea. Moreover, we identified that 2 and 3 drug combinations inhibit Ebola replication when administered 24 hours post-infection. Drug combinations have important implications for clinical use, since lower doses of each drug are administered, potentially decreasing side-effects and, based on different mechanisms of action, there is less likelihood for the emergence of drug resistance.

However little is known about the causes of the disease due to a lack of diagnostic facilities in this relatively resource-poor setting. Knowledge about the etiologies and clinical outcome of viral encephalitis is necessary for future design of intervention studies targeted at improvement of clinical management, treatment and prevention of the disease. We report the viral agents, clinical outcome and prognostic factors of mortality of encephalitis in children admitted to a referral hospital for children in southern Vietnam. We show that about one third of the enrolled patients die acutely, and that mortality is independently associated with patient age and Glasgow Coma Scale on admission. Japanese encephalitis, dengue virus and enterovirus (including enterovirus 71) are the major viruses detected in our patients. However, more than half of the patients remain undiagnosed, while mortality in this group is as high as in the diagnosed group. This study will benefit clinicians and public health in terms of clinical management and prevention of childhood encephalitis in Vietnam."

Integrins are proteins linking the cell inner and outer environments, which act as a bridge that crosses the cell membrane. Integrins respond to mechanical loads exerted to them by changing their conformations. Several diseases, such as atherosclerosis and different types of cancer, are caused by altered function of integrins. Essential to the formation of focal adhesions is the process of integrin clustering. Bidirectional integrin signaling involves conformational changes in this protein, clustering, and finally the assembly of a large intracellular adhesion complex. Integrin clustering is defined as the interaction of integrins to form lateral assemblies that eventually lead to focal adhesion formation. The effect of the plasma membrane on formation of integrin clusters has been largely neglected in current literature; subsequently some apparently contradictory data has been reported by a number of researchers in the field. Using a molecular dynamics modeling approach, a computational method that simulates systems in a full-atomic scale, we probe the role of the plasma membrane in integrin clustering and hypothesize a clustering scenario that explains the relationship between integrin activation and focal adhesion growth."

This analysis of 733 cases, which is the largest series of cases evaluating the role of LST in ACL highlights and establishes the usefulness of this complementary diagnostic tool with a strong correlation with lesion smear and a demonstration that false positive responses due to previous exposure to the parasite are not of concern. The results support the use of LST in endemic areas to assist in guiding clinical decisions regarding treatment initiation."

They pose a unique treatment challenge due to their ability to modify the immune response in infected individuals. For example, in leprosy there are two distinct manifestations of the disease, each characterized by the immune response of the individual. One results in a more disseminated and severe form of the disease, lepromatous leprosy, and the other is a more limited form with marked antimicrobial activity, tuberculoid leprosy. These differences in the immune response can be characterized by the phenotype and activation state of the macrophage. We illustrate how the local endothelial microenvironment can “educate” macrophages, identifying Jagged1 and select small molecules that can regulate this pathway. Therefore, these studies identify a potential strategy to intervene in infection and inflammation, by targeting macrophage instruction at the site of disease. Through the integration of in vitro modeling and gene expression profiles at the site of disease, we found that Jagged 1 harnesses the endothelial microenvironment to instruct antimicrobial macrophage responses in leprosy."

In this study, we have identified classes of disease that are associated with a surprisingly large number of genes involved in any of several tissue-specific developmental processes. To do so, we developed a novel approach whose strength comes from pooling genetic information across related diseases, overcoming problems ordinarily posed by limited information about individual gene-disease relationships. We demonstrate the method's efficacy both by examining its ability to highlight connections between gene sets and disease classes that are known to be related, and by demonstrating that the approach recovers expected broad classes of connections, such as those between heart development and cardiovascular disorders. However, by examining unexpected connections in this data set, we are able to develop new understanding of some surprising disease relationships, such as the one between dementia and osteoporosis. Such connections may lead to a better overall understanding of the role of development in lifelong health, as well as to the design of new methods to treat a range of diseases."

In order to develop and test a hookworm vaccine in endemic areas, the understanding of the impact of multiple helminth infections (co-infection) on the immune response against hookworm in infected individuals is crucial. The authors report in their article, that several parameters of the cellular (T cell markers, cytokines, chemokines) and humoral immune response (e.g. IgG4 and IgE antibodies) against hookworm are significantly affected or modulated in individuals co-infected with hookworm, roundworm and/or schistosomes. These results imply that the immune response against components of a hookworm vaccine might be altered by previous contact with other helminth species in endemic areas."

The island-encoded sRNA IsrK belongs to Gifsy-1 prophage of Salmonella. Here, we report a complex mechanism in which the IsrK RNA functions as both sRNA and mRNA to control the production of the toxic AntQ protein. The isrK promoter directs the synthesis of two distinct RNA species: a full-length translationally inactive target mRNA and the correctly terminated, shorter IsrK sRNA. IsrK sRNA binds the full-length inactive mRNA producing an antiterminator protein, AntQ, which interferes with transcription termination. Expression of antQ results in bacterial growth arrest and ultimately cell death. Fluorescence microscopy of E. coli and Salmonella expressing antQ revealed condensed chromatin morphology as observed upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents. We propose that expression of the phage antiterminator protein results in conflicts between transcription and replication machineries and thus facilitates DNA damage. In summary, the RNA regulator IsrK presents a new regulatory principle in which a horizontally acquired sRNA controls genome integrity."

Fusion is mediated by special glycoprotein machineries that must be triggered only at the right time and at the right place. A major cue that viruses utilize for triggering is acidic pH. Until recently, such pH-induced triggering was assumed to be the only mechanism used by the Arenaviridae family. However, Lassa virus, a notorious pathogenic member of this family, was shown to use the binding to an intracellular receptor named LAMP1 to potentiate its pH-induced triggering. This two-step mechanism was a surprising finding that raised critical questions regarding the cell-entry mechanisms of other viruses from this family. Here we used a structure-guided approach to investigate whether other Arenaviridae utilize LAMP1 for cell entry. We mapped the LAMP1 binding site on the Lassa-derived glycoprotein and confirmed its identity using grafting experiments. This mapping revealed the unique sequence signature needed for LAMP1 binding. Sequence analysis suggests that no other members of the Arenaviridae bind LAMP1."

We examined E. coli growing in the simplest imaginable environment, one constant in space and time and rich in resources, and attempted to identify the rules that relate the genome to the cell composition and self-replication time. With more than 4,400 genes, a full-scale model would be prohibitively complicated, and therefore we “coarse-grained” E. coli by lumping together genes and proteins of similar function. We used this model to examine measurements of strains with reduced copy number of ribosomal-RNA genes, and also to show that increasing this copy number overcrowds the cell with ribosomes and proteins. As a result, there appears to be an optimum copy number with respect to the wild-type genome, in agreement with observation. We hope that this model will improve and further challenge our understanding of bacterial physiology, also in more complicated environments."

The World Health Organization's (WHO) control strategy includes antibiotic treatment of all community members, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvements. By determining how prevalent trachoma is, decisions can be made whether control activities need to be put in place. Knowing what factors make people more at risk of having trachoma can help target trachoma control efforts to those most at risk. We looked at the prevalence of active trachoma and C. trachomatis infection in the eyes of children aged 0–5 years in The Gambia and Tanzania. We also measured risk factors associated with having active trachoma or infection. The prevalence of both active trachoma and infection was lower in The Gambia (6.7% and 0.8%, respectively) than in Tanzania (32.3% and 21.9%, respectively). Risk factors for active trachoma were similar in the two countries. For infection, the risk factors in Tanzania were similar to those for TF, whereas in The Gambia, only ocular discharge was associated with infection. These results show that although the prevalence of active trachoma and infection is very different between the two countries, the risk factors for active trachoma are similar but those for infection are different."

To ensure its long-term survival in the host, Mtb must be able to sense and respond to changes in its immediate environment, such as the pH differences that occur in the phagosome in which it lives. Knowledge of the external signals that Mtb recognizes during infection is critical for understanding the impact of the microenvironment on Mtb pathogenesis and persistence, and how Mtb interacts with its host cell. We show here that [Cl−] correlates inversely with pH as the phagosome matures, and identify [Cl−] as a novel cue that Mtb responds to, in synergism with pH. By constructing a Mtb strain that fluorescently reports on changes in [Cl−] and pH, we find using a mouse model of infection that environmental alterations in Mtb's phagosomal home are mediated at the local level by activities of the host immune system. Our study demonstrates how a pathogen can exploit linked environmental cues during infection, and shows the value of reporter bacterial strains for Mtb-host whole animal studies."

Recognition of aberrant RNA involves a number of RNA binding proteins and other factors that target them for degradation by the exosome. Here, we used a genetic approach to identify proteins involved in the degradation of a mis-spliced RNA by the nuclear exosome in plants. Our screen identified two known components of nuclear RNA degradation pathway, namely the exosome core subunit RRP4 and the exosome-associated RNA helicase HEN2 that is required for the elimination of non-ribosomal RNAs by the nuclear exosome. Furthermore, we identified SOP1 as a novel putative exosome cofactor that is required for the degradation of some, but not all, of the substrates of HEN2."

In this study, we used a biophysically detailed model of the human atria and torso to develop an algorithm based on the correlation between the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal from a 64-lead vest and the location of rapid focal and re-entrant excitation. Using the properties of the atrial activation and the ECG signals, we developed a focus-location algorithm which is able to distinguish rapid focal activity from re-entrant scroll waves centred in the same location. Based on simulated data, the algorithm had success rates of 93% and 76% for correctly identifying the origin of focal and re-entrant excitation, respectively, and 88% for distinguish focal and re-entrant excitation, with no false positives.

But it is likely that there is an important role for healthcare, which was not investigated in this study.It is important for Ghana and other sub-Saharan African countries to improve the measurement and monitoring of child mortality and its social, environmental, and healthcare risk factors at the community level."

It is critical to evaluate immunologic status of individuals who work directly with rabies virus (RABV) (laboratorians) or at high risk of infection due to interaction with animals (veterinarians and animal control workers). In addition, rabies vaccination records and demonstration of VNAs in animals are mandatory before initiating pet travel to rabies-free counties or regions. Rabies VNAs are currently determined by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) and the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (FAVN) test, which measure the ability of antibodies to bind and prevent infection of RABV in vitro. Both assays require staining of infected cells using anti-rabies antibodies and manual observation of infected cells by a fluorescent microscope to determine VNA titers. In this study, we have developed a GFP reporter-based high throughput neutralization test (HTNT) for automated quantification of infected cells. This method has the advantages of allowing investigators to analyze and store the results, and can accommodate large sample sizes.

In translation, transfer RNAs act as adapter molecules that decode mRNA into protein and thereby play a central role in gene expression. In the tRNA maturation process, a subset of the normal nucleosides undergoes modifications. Modified nucleosides in the tRNA anticodon region are important for efficient translation. We found that, in the worm C. elegans, components of the Elongator complex are required for the formation of a certain set of tRNA modifications in the anticodon region. We observed a reduced efficiency of translation as well as a lower production of neurotransmitters in Elongator mutant worms. Elongator is conserved in eukaryotes, and mutations in a subunit of human Elongator cause a severe neurodegenerative disease, familial dysautonomia (FD). It is unclear in humans whether Elongator acts on the translational level through tRNA modification to regulate neuronal processes. Our observations in C. elegans, together with the role of yeast Elongator in translation, show that the function of Elongator in tRNA modification is conserved. Inactivation of Elongator may cause neuronal defects by affecting translation."

Here, we showed that ERRα deficiency led to increased interferon production, resulting in enhanced resistance to viral infection both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, viral infection induced TBK1-dependent ERRα stabilization, which in turn increased its binding to TBK1 and IRF3 to prevent the formation of a functional TBK1-IRF3 complex. The effect of ERRα on IFN-I production was independent of its transcriptional activity and PCG-1α. Notably, ERRα chemical inhibitor XCT790 has broad antiviral potency. Taken together, our results identified ERRα as an important negative downstream regulator of TBK1 in RLRs-TLRs signaling pathways and suggested a potential therapeutic target for viral infection."

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the leading bacterial cause of such disease; hundreds of millions of cases occur every year. The severe watery diarrhoea associated with ETEC infections results from the action of enterotoxins. The toxins target human gut epithelial cells and trigger the loss of water and electrolytes into the gut lumen. Oral rehydration therapy can counteract this process. Hence, glucose and salt solutions promote rehydration of the patient. In this work we show that the gene regulatory mechanisms controlling toxin expression respond directly to sugar and salt. Furthermore, we describe a molecular mechanism to explain these effects. Hence, we provide a starting point for the optimisation of oral rehydration solutions to reduce toxin expression over the course of an ETEC infection."

To improve genomic resources for C. briggsae, we created two sets of inbred lines derived from crosses between diverged C. briggsae strains. High-throughput genotyping of these has improved the resolution of the recombination map and genome assembly. It also allows detailed comparisons of recombination both within and between species. Unexpectedly, we found that alleles from one parental strain were much more likely to be fixed on three of the six chromosomes in one of the sets of lines. One of these biases is caused by a pronounced developmental delay in F2 progeny that is seen in both reciprocal crosses, whereas the other two manifest in only one of the two cross directions. This indicates that the parental strains have diverged in both nuclear and nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions, either because of local adaptation or restricted gene flow across much of the genome."

Results show that vorinostat treatment induces HIV transcription transiently and that the sustained induction of HIV transcription may depend on the temporal impact of vorinostat on host gene expression. Our results also suggest that vorinostat treatment is not sufficient to induce killing of latently infected cells in a majority of HIV-infected individuals on cART."

Sometimes avian virus genomic segments are able to shift to a human host, either in toto or by combining with those that underwent a previous host shift event. Such host shift events can cause worldwide pandemics in their immunologically naive hosts. In order for these host shifts to establish a stable lineage, the virus has to adapt to the new host. Identifying the changes that have occurred in the past can provide important clues about how this process happens, and how surveillance for new influenza threats should be targeted. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine whether an amino acid has changed due to adaptation to the new host or whether the change occurred through random drift. Here we describe a novel phylogenetic approach to identifying locations where the nature of the selective pressure exerted on the location has changed corresponding to the host shift event. We identify a set of locations on a number of the genomic segments. The approach we describe is of wide applicability when the timing of the change of selective constraints is known in advance."

Ecological communities are not only diverse in terms of the species that compose them but also in terms of the way they interact with each other: for example, species compete for space and for food, eat and facilitate each other. The diversity of ways species interact has rarely been taken into account in the study of ecological communities, although widely acknowledged. Here we show that the diversity of interaction types matters: it affects species diversity, community functioning and the relationship between them by strengthening this relationship. This means that when the diversity of interaction types is taken into account, species losses have stronger impacts on the functioning of ecological communities. Our results therefore suggest that species loss may have more important consequences than expected based on classical models that do not take the diversity of interaction types into account."

The existence of asymptomatic infected people has served as an incentive to believe that an effective vaccine is possible, but unfortunately no successful immunological characterization of such cases was obtained. Patients recovered from visceral leishmaniasis show a similar immunological profile to asymptomatic infected individuals and both exhibit a strong cell-mediated immune response against Leishmania antigens and are resistant to disease. Since the past decade several approaches were undertaken to try to shed light on the immunological profile associated with such “resistance” to infections, notwithstanding antigenic recognition profile associated to resistance to infection was not successfully explored. In the present manuscript we describe a specific IgG recognizing pattern associated with resistant individuals (asymptomatic infected people and recovery patients to visceral leishmaniasis). These data highlight the possibility of using specific proteins in serological tests for the identification of asymptomatic infected individuals."

Occasionally RNAi has been lost, precluding its use as a tool, as well as raising the question of what forces could lead to loss of such a key pathway. Genomic and functional studies previously showed that within trypanosomatids protozoans RNAi was absent in both Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi. The genome of L. braziliensis, a member of the early diverging Leishmania subgenus Viannia, retained key genes required for RNAi such as an Argonaute. We demonstrated that in fact L. braziliensis shows strong RNAi activity with reporter and endogenous genes affecting flagellar function. These data suggest that RNAi may be productively applied for functional genomic studies in L. braziliensis. We mapped the evolutionary point at which RNAi was lost in lineage leading to Leishmania and Crithidia, and establish that RNAi must have been lost at least twice in the trypanosomatids, once on the lineage leading to T. cruzi and independently following the divergence of the Viannia subgenus from other Leishmania species. Lastly, we discuss hypotheses concerning the forces leading to the loss of RNAi in Leishmania evolution, including viral invasion, increased genome plasticity, and altered virulence."

This growing field rests on the evolutionary relatedness of organisms, and at its frontier is the inference of ecological processes from phylogenetic diversity. However, the rapidly reducing cost of sequencing means that computational analysis of phylogenetic data is becoming increasingly intractable. We develop a new analytical method to address this issue, providing a computationally-efficient way to compare local phylogenetic diversity to a sample from a regional pool of organisms, under a given ecological process. Our approach has both pragmatic and far-reaching applications. Until now investigators have lacked even an analytical method to compare the diversity of unequally-sized communities without throwing data away, while on a deeper level our theory provides a new framework for connecting phylogenetic data to a wide range of ecological processes. As an application of our approach, we use our methods to distinguish between random, clustered and overdispersed sampling for human microbiome habitats. Finally, we identify a new, phylogenetic analogue of the widely used taxonomic measure of diversity, the Species Abundance Distribution, and we find that it has consistent behavior across microbiome habitats."

Although these are often associated with defects in neural crest development, the more severe phenotypic manifestations of midline defects is facial clefting, which is poorly understood. In this work, we show that the facial clefting phenotype of PDGFRα mutants is not associated with a defect in neural crest cell specification but rather a subsequent defect in the medial nasal process (MNP), a facial primordium derived from the frontonasal prominence. We further show that this defect is associated with alterations in both cell proliferation and cell migration, and that PI3K and Rac1 signaling are essential to maintain a normal level of cell proliferation. Last, we provide evidence that Rac1 regulates cell migration at the level of cell motility as well as chemotaxis under the regulation of PDGFRα. We thus establish PDGFRα as a novel regulator of MNP development and elucidate the roles of its downstream signaling pathways at cellular and molecular levels."

The largest parasite losses occur in the mosquito midgut where robust immune responses are activated. Variability in P. falciparum infection levels indicates that parasite transmission is the result of complex interactions between vectors and parasites, which rely on both genetic and environmental factors. However, in contrast to genetically encoded factors, the role of environmental factors in parasite transmission has received little attention. In this study, we characterized the midgut microbiota of mosquitoes derived from diverse breeding sites using pyrosequencing. We show that the composition of the midgut microbiota in adult mosquitoes exhibits great variability, which is likely determined by bacterial richness of the larval habitats. When field mosquitoes were collected at late immature stages in natural breeding sites and the emerging females challenged with Plasmodium falciparum in the laboratory, significant correlation was observed between P. falciparum infection and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae in the mosquito midgut. Greater understanding of these malaria-bacteria interactions may lead to novel malaria control strategies."

Vector resistance to the insecticides used has been postulated as one of the possible reasons explaining this failure. A number of studies in the region have shown a variable degree of resistance to DDT in areas where this insecticide has been widely used for IRS (mainly India). However there is no coordinated and standardized program to monitor resistance to insecticides in the region. In this study we tested P. argentipes susceptibility to DDT and deltamethrin in VL endemic villages in India and Nepal. The results confirmed the DDT resistance in India and in a border village of Nepal.

Previous studies have identified a region on chromosome 22 containing two genes, MYH9 and APOL1, which likely accounts for nearly all of this difference. Previous reports provided strong statistical evidence implicating APOL1 as the major contributor to nephropathy risk in African Americans, driven by two coding variants, termed G1 and G2. However, other groups still report statistical evidence for MYH9 association in kidney disease, and animal models have demonstrated biological relevance for MYH9 function in the kidney. Here, we show that suppressing apol1 in zebrafish embryos results in perturbed kidney function. Importantly, using this in vivo assay, we show that the G1 variant appears to cause a loss of APOL1 function, while the G2 variant results in an altered protein that may be acting antagonistically in the presence of normal APOL1. We also report a genetic interaction between apol1 and myh9 under anemic stress, which is consistent with our previous findings in sickle cell disease (SCD) nephropathy patients.

After one year, 10 glasses and 10 pants survive. What can be said about the relative quality of the survivors? Well, clothes “die” as a result of accumulated wear; the surviving items are of better quality. The breaking of a wineglass is an external, random event: here the survivors are not the best, but the luckiest. To tell apart the superior from the fortunate, one should examine the development over time: the number of surviving items decays exponentially with time for the glasses and follows a sigmoid curve for the pants. An ongoing argument among macroecologists deals with similar issues. Adaptive theories suggest that the frequent species are the fittest, while the neutral theory explains the observed frequencies as a result of demographic stochasticity, assuming all species to have the same fitness. The histories suggested by the two scenarios are clearly different, but how can one probe the prehistoric abundance of species? In fact, past abundance is reflected in current genetic variance within a population. Here, we present a new technique, based on the Fu-Li F-statistic, which allows one to distinguish between niche and neutral scenarios and to resolve this important debate."

These children will have to be repeatedly treated since reinfection will occur due to contaminated environments in the absence of improvements in hygiene and sanitation. Repeated treatment of school-aged children may have the added benefit of reductions in levels of infection for the whole community. This will in part be determined by the proportion of the total worms harboured or eggs output by school-aged children, a product of how heavily infected school-aged children are and how many school-aged children there are in the community. In one setting school-aged children output as little as 15% of hookworm eggs whereas in another setting they harbour up to 50% of roundworms. Thus, whilst school-based programmes may have important health benefits, the community-level impact on transmission could be limited unless school-aged children over-contribute to infection. We use mathematical models to show that if children contribute more infective stages to the environment which adults are exposed to than adults do, the reductions in transmission resulting from treating children will be larger, but may still be limited."

This mycobacteria resides in water where it could colonize many ecological niches such as aquatic plants, herbivorous animals, and water bugs. The latter were shown to be able to transmit the bacteria to mammalian hosts. Here, we described that the bacilli could be structured with a thick envelope called the extracellular matrix (ECM). This peculiar coat contains in small vesicles a toxin named mycolactone, the main virulence factor of M. ulcerans. The ECM confers to the mycobacterium increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and plays a role in virulence. Indeed, a bacteria with ECM is more potent for colonization of insect vectors and mammalian hosts compared to bacteria. Unraveling the regulation of the production of the ECM together with the export of mycolactone will be an important step in developing new pharmacological approaches for the treatment of Buruli ulcer, which has been greatly handicapped by the lack of effectiveness of the current antibiotics."

Unfortunately, no specific anti-adenoviral treatments are available to treat disseminated adenoviral infections. We have set out to identify host factors promoting adenoviral growth and could identify the cellular protein Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) being central to adenoviral infection. Here we show that USP7 interacts with the viral protein E1B-55K, a central regulator of adenoviral replication and adenoviral oncogene-mediated cellular transformation. We demonstrate that USP7 ensures stability and/or proper expression levels of adenoviral proteins at early and late time points of infection. Consistent with this, small-molecule inhibitors of USP7 showed efficient reduction of capsid protein levels and viral progeny numbers. Thus, USP7 inhibition might be a useful treatment option in the context of disseminated adenoviral infections. Moreover, we were also able to show that adenoviral oncogene-mediated cellular transformation can be hampered by USP7 disruption. In summary, this study shows that two different adenoviral disease mechanisms can be inhibited by targeting one host cellular factor."

About 10% of the population will have at least one seizure during their lifetime, and 1% will experience persistent, recurrent epileptic seizures. Moreover, for about one-third of patients, epilepsy is intractable with seizures that are not controlled with any available drugs. Genetic seizure suppressors are modifier mutations that are capable of reverting seizure susceptibility to wild type levels when combined with seizure-prone mutants in double mutant individuals. Suppressors are valuable in providing an experimental approach that can provide insight into mechanisms underlying seizure susceptibility. Also, they identify novel gene products that may be targets for therapeutic drug development. In the present study we show that a severe seizure phenotype of the Drosophila paralyticbss1 (parabss1) mutant is 90% suppressed by the N-type calcium channel mutation cacophonyTS2 (cacTS2). The effect of suppression is not restricted to parabss1, but cacTS2 can also revert seizure-like phenotypes of other Drosophila mutants like easily-shocked (eas) and slamdance (sda). Thus, cacTS2 acts as a highly potent, general seizure suppressor mutation. A surprising finding in this study is co-suppression: parabss1 also suppresses a seizure phenotype in cacTS2 mutants induced by elevated temperature. A current view of complex diseases such as epilepsy, is that multiple genes and environmental factors can each contribute small, additive effects that can summate to produce a disease state when some threshold value is exceeded. Our findings indicate that different pathogenic ion channel mutations can sometimes form therapeutic combinations with effects that mask one another."

Their embryos offer many advantages for the analysis of transcriptional circuits that control developmental programs. During early development of the common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a signaling center located within the ventral ectoderm sends two key signals, Nodal and BMP2/4, that control patterning of the embryo along the whole dorsal-ventral axis. How this signaling center works is not understood. We have conducted a large-scale functional analysis of the genes responsible for patterning of the ectoderm along the dorsal-ventral axis. We identified direct targets of Nodal and BMP2/4 and identified several key regulators that mediate the effects of these factors and drive essential and probably ancient regulatory circuits that together constitute a transcriptional program controlling morphogenesis of the embryo. In addition, we uncovered a striking parallel between the mouse embryo and the sea urchin embryo by showing that in both models a neurogenic ectoderm is the default state of ectoderm differentiation in the absence of Nodal and BMP signaling. Our results support the idea that inhibition of Nodal and BMP signaling was probably an ancient mechanism to specify neural cells in the ancestor of vertebrates."

Predicting when and why one type of mutation is more likely to underlie a phenotypic change than another remains a pressing challenge for evolution biology. Understanding the relative frequency and properties of different types of mutations will help resolve this issue. To this end, we isolated 231 mutants with altered activity of a focal gene. Mutants were classified into one of four functional classes (i.e., coding, cis-regulatory, trans-acting, or copy number) based on the location and nature of mutation(s), or lack thereof, within the focal gene. Mutant effects on focal gene activity were assessed in both haploid and diploid cells. These data identified differences in the frequency, effects, and dominance (relative to the wild-type allele) among functional classes of mutants that help explain patterns of genetic variation within and between species."

This phenomenon could be exploited to combat existing drug resistance and to delay the emergence of resistance to new drugs. However, much remains to be understood about the mechanisms that underlie drug hypersensitivity in otherwise drug-resistant microbes. Here, we describe two mechanisms by which the Plasmodium falciparum ‘chloroquine resistance transporter’ (PfCRT) causes the malaria parasite to become hypersensitive to structurally-diverse drugs. First, we show that an antimalarial drug that normally exerts its killing effect within the parasite’s digestive vacuole is also able to bind extremely tightly to certain forms of PfCRT. This activity will block the natural, essential function of the protein and thereby provide the drug with an additional killing effect. The second mechanism arises when a cytosolic-acting drug that normally sequesters within the digestive vacuole is leaked back into the cytosol via PfCRT. In both cases, mutations that suppress hypersensitivity also abrogate the ability of PfCRT to transport chloroquine, thus explaining why rescue from hypersensitivity restores the parasite’s sensitivity to this antimalarial. These insights provide a foundation for understanding and exploiting the hypersensitivity of chloroquine-resistant parasites to several of the current antimalarials."

Anthrax is a life-threatening disease caused by inhalation or ingestion of spores, or transmission through wounds and abrasions. The bacterium secretes toxins, proteins that enter numerous cell types in an infected individual altering their function and contributing to the disease process. Consequently, we and other researchers are dedicated to identifying cells affected by anthrax toxins and to understanding the implications for the function of those cells. We have observed that anthrax toxins adversely affect a type of cell in the immune system known as a natural killer–like T (NKT) cell. NKT cells are found in the bone marrow, blood, spleen, lymph nodes and liver and are required for optimal immune responses. We report that anthrax toxins effectively shut down NKT cells, preventing them from functioning normally. We propose that this has serious consequences because anyone infected with Bacillus anthracis will be less able to mount an immune response against it."

To begin to answer this question, we focus on one of the simplest cases: mutations that cause completely recessive, lethal Mendelian diseases. We first review theory about what to expect from mutation and selection in a population of finite size and generate predictions based on simulations using a plausible demographic scenario of recent human evolution. For a highly mutable type of mutation, transitions at CpG sites, we find that the predictions are close to the observed frequencies of recessive lethal disease mutations. For less mutable types, however, predictions substantially under-estimate the observed frequency. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy and point to a complication that, to our knowledge, is not widely appreciated: that there exists ascertainment bias in disease mutation discovery. Specifically, we suggest that alleles that have been identified to date are likely the ones that by chance have reached higher frequencies and are thus more likely to have been mapped. More generally, our study highlights the factors that influence the frequencies of Mendelian disease alleles."

Infection results in an acute fever often associated with profuse internal and external bleeding and death rates of up to 90%. Due to these symptoms and high pathogenicity, these viruses have been heavily publicized in the media. The first step of infection is entry, where the virus is taken up and penetrates into the cell, from which it spreads throughout the body. While it is known that the cell must engulf the virus by the process of endocytosis, we know little about how the virus triggers this event. Here, we use a novel technology to measure penetration of Ebola virus into the cell in real time and show that Ebola virus stimulates phosphoinositide-3 kinase, a signaling molecule known to induce endocytosis. Importantly, drugs that interfere with this signaling inhibit infection by Ebola virus and block virus spread. This work provides a mechanistic insight into how Ebola virus manipulates the cell to start an infection, may explain part of virus induced pathogenesis, and provides a potential way to treat this deadly disease."

In China, the typical morphotype is ribbed-shelled, with its distribution restricted to mainland China. Smooth-shelled snails with varix are also distributed in China, which are considered to belong to the same subspecies as the ribbed-shelled snails. In this study we investigate the genetic variation among O. hupensis from different geographical origins using combined complete ITS1 and ITS2 regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Snails including ribbed-shelled and smooth-shelled (but with varix on the shell) from the lake/marshland region of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and smooth-shelled snails from mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, were genetically distinct with no shared haplotypes detected. Furtheremore, the snails from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces were clustered in separate clades in the phylogenetic tree, and three clades were observed for snails from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The population diversity of O. hupensis in China is thus considered large, and evolutionary relationships in the host-parasite system of O. hupensis-S. japonicum may be of interest for further research."

Associated benefits have included alleviation of depression, memory loss, and symptoms of Parkinson disease, as well as accelerated bone and wound healing and the treatment of certain cancers, independently of surgery or drugs. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that repetitive magnetic field exposure in human cells stimulates production of biological stress response chemicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). At moderate doses, we find that reactive oxygen actively stimulates cellular repair and stress response pathways, which might account for the observed therapeutic effects to repetitive magnetic stimulation. We further show that this response requires the function of a well-characterized, evolutionarily conserved flavoprotein receptor known as cryptochrome, which has been implicated in magnetic sensing in organisms ranging from plants to flies, including migratory birds. We conclude that exposure to weak magnetic fields induces the production of ROS in human cells and that this process requires the presence of the cryptochrome receptor."

Although facilitated by environmental heterogeneity, this phenomenon also occurs in simple, homogeneous environments provisioned with a single limiting nutrient. We sought to discover genetic mechanisms that enabled an E. coli population founded by a single clone to become an interacting community composed of multiple clones. The founder of this population contained mutations that impair regulation of acetate and glycerol metabolism and likely favored the evolution of cross-feeding. Adaptive clones share cis- and trans-regulatory mutations shown elsewhere to enhance fitness under glucose limitation. Certain mutations that distinguish adaptive clones and underlie evolution of specialists were compensatory rather than gain-of-function, and all that we detected resulted in gene expression changes rather than protein structure changes. Evolved clones exhibited both common and clone-specific gene expression changes relative to their common ancestor; the pattern of gene expression in the dominant clone cultured alone differed from the pattern observed when it was cultured with variants feeding on its overflow metabolites. These findings illuminate the roles played by founder genotype, differential gene regulation, and the biotic environment in the adaptive evolution of bacteria."

To derive valid inferences from multiple, noisy datasets, one must consider all possible combinations of the data to find the solution that best matches the experimental evidence. Exhaustive searches totally outstrip current computer resources, and, as a result, it has been necessary to resort to approximations such as branch and bound or Monte Carlo simulations, which have the disadvantages of being limited to use in separate steps of the analysis and not providing the final results in a probabilistic fashion that allows the quality of the answers to be evaluated. The Probabilistic Interaction Network of Evidence (PINE) algorithm that we present here offers a general solution to this problem. We have demonstrated the usefulness of the PINE approach by applying it to one of the major bottlenecks in NMR spectroscopy. The PINE-NMR server takes as input the sequence of a protein and the peak lists from one or more multidimensional NMR experiments and provides as output a probabilistic assignment of the NMR signals to specific atoms in the protein's covalent structure and a self-consistent probabilistic analysis of the protein's secondary structure."

The disease results in systemic and neurological disability to its victims. At present, only four drugs are available for treatment of HAT. However, these drugs are expensive, limited in efficacy and are severely toxic, hence the need to develop new therapies. Previously, the short TbruGSK-3 short has been validated as a potential target for developing new drugs against HAT. Because this enzyme has also been pursued as a drug target for other diseases, several inhibitors are available for screening against the parasite enzyme. Here we present the results of screening over 16,000 inhibitors of human GSK-3β (HsGSK-3) from the Pfizer compound collection against TbruGSK-3 short. The resulting active compounds were tested for selectivity versus HsGSK-3β and a panel of human kinases, as well as their ability to inhibit proliferation of the parasite in vitro.

Available therapies for leishmaniasis are problematic due to emerging drug resistance, toxicity and/or the need for lengthy courses of treatment. There is thus an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches to this neglected tropical disease.

Although sphingolipids have been studied extensively, the details of their functioning are difficult to understand, because their synthesis, pathways of inter-conversion, and utilization constitute a complex, dynamically changing system. We analyze the role of yeast sphingolipids in the response to heat stress. Data show that the profile of these lipids changes almost immediately with the initiation of the stress, but it is a priori unclear how this response is organized. Using experimental data, a sophisticated dynamic model, and a novel optimization strategy, we show how changes in enzyme activities are temporally organized. Intriguingly, the results show that the cells take up as much material as possible in the first few minutes of heat stress and then shut down entry and exit routes of the biosynthetic pathway system. After about 30 minutes, when heat stress is still in effect, the enzyme activity profile is still significantly changed, but the metabolites have regained concentrations that are essentially the same as those under optimal conditions. The results demonstrate how novel insights are achievable with an effective combination of experimental and theoretical research."

However, little is done to validate and characterize the fusion RNAs. Using one prostate cell line and a discovery pipeline for cis-splicing between adjacent genes (cis-SAGe), we found 16 new such events. We then developed a set of rules based on the characteristics of these fusion RNAs, and applied them to 20 random neighboring gene pairs. Four turned out to be true.

Yet, while studies of this process in mouse have substantially improved our knowledge of human erythropoiesis, recent work has shown a significant divergence in global gene expression across species, suggesting that extrapolation from mouse models to human is not always straightforward. In order to better understand these differences, we have performed a comparative epigenomic analysis of six histone modifications and four master transcription factors. By globally comparing chromatin structure across primary cells and model cell lines in both species, we discovered that while chromatin structure is well conserved at orthologous promoters, subtle changes are predictive of species-specific gene expression. Furthermore, we discovered that the genomic localizations of master transcription factors are poorly conserved, and species-specific losses or gains are associated with changes to the underlying chromatin structure and concomitant gene expression. By using our comparative epigenomics framework, we identified a putative human-specific cis-regulatory module that drives expression of human, but not mouse, GDF15, a gene implicated in iron homeostasis.

Hundreds of inbred mouse strains have been developed that vary in characteristics such as susceptibility to cancer or other diseases. There is much interest in uncovering differences between strains that result in different traits and, to aid this effort, millions of single nucleotide differences or polymorphisms between strains have been cataloged. To date, there has been less emphasis placed on other sources of genetic variation. In this study, we have conducted a genome-wide analysis to examine the level of polymorphism of mouse endogenous retroviral sequences (ERVs). ERVs are derived from infectious retroviruses that now exist in the genome and are inherited as part of chromosomes. Unlike in humans, genomic insertions of ERVs cause many new mutations in mice but their extent of variation between strains has been difficult to study because of their high copy numbers. By comparing genomic sequences of four common mouse strains, we found very high levels of polymorphism for two large active families of ERVs. Moreover, we documented nearly 700 polymorphic ERVs located within gene introns and found evidence that some of these affect gene transcript levels. This study demonstrates that ERV polymorphisms are a major source of genetic variability among mouse strains and likely contribute to strain-specific traits."

Developing male germ cells, especially spermatocytes and spermatids, display a transcriptome enriched in short 3’UTR transcripts, which has been demonstrated to be essential for spermatogenesis. However, it remains unknown how global 3’UTR shortening is achieved. Here, we report that most of the genes, especially those ubiquitously expressed, are transcribed into multiple isoforms in spermatocytes, and when spermatocytes develop into round spermatids, those long 3’UTR transcripts are selectively degraded by UPF2-dependent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), leading to enrichment of the shorter 3’UTR transcripts. We provide physiological evidence supporting a non-canonical role of NMD in the control of 3’UTR length in male germ cells."

Among these, symporters are in charge of the transport of molecules (like sugars, amino acids, osmolytes) inside the cells, exploiting the concentration gradient of an ion to perform the task. Here we investigate by atomistic simulations the transport mechanism of the Sodium-Galactose symporter. Our results allow constructing a detailed and quantitative model of the release process of the two ligands. Surprisingly, we find that the galactose is released to the cytosol independently from the ion, unambiguously indicating that the coupling in their transport mechanism is associated to the steps preceding the release process. A large family of symporters shares the same fold and potentially the same transport mechanism. As such our results are important also because they can provide insights on common mechanistic features of these transporters."

We conducted a molecular epidemiological study of rabies using the complete glycoprotein (G) gene from 235 animal brain samples collected in the Philippines between 2004 and 2010. We identified three major clades and two distinct genogroups in the Philippines. The three major clades L, V, and M were found specifically in the Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao island groups, respectively. Additionally, two minor genogroups were located in the Luzon island group. These data suggest that although human mediated transmission may have occurred, these virus clades evolved independently after a single introduction into each island group. All of the analyzed Philippine strains were clustered into Asian 2b, which diverged from the Chinese strain Asian 2a. No recent introduction of rabies into the Philippines from other countries was apparent. The elimination of rabies by 2020 is a national goal in the Philippines, necessitating urgent development of a more effective and feasible strategy for controlling rabies. Our findings indicate that a geographically targeted dog vaccination campaign may effectively control rabies in island nations such as the Philippines."

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that speech is, by default, a multimodal phenomenon: we use both faces and voices together to communicate. Thus, understanding the evolution of speech requires a comparative approach using closely-related extant primate species and recognition that vocal communication is audiovisual. Using computer-generated avatar faces, we compared the integration of faces and voices in monkeys and humans performing an identical detection task. Both species responded faster when faces and voices were presented together relative to the face or voice alone. While the details sometimes appeared to differ, the behavior of both species could be well explained by a “superposition” model positing the linear summation of activity patterns in response to visual and auditory components of vocalizations. Other, more popular computational models of multisensory integration failed to explain our data. Thus, the superposition model represents a putative homologous mechanism for integrating faces and voices across primate species."

How have these genes originated? The advent of massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has provided new clues to this question, with the discovery of an unexpectedly high number of transcripts that do not correspond to typical protein-coding genes, and which could serve as a substrate for this process. Here we have examined RNA-Seq data from 8 mammalian species in order to define a set of putative newly-born genes in human and chimpanzee and investigate what drives their expression. This is the largest-scale project to date that tries to address this scientific question. We have found thousands of transcripts that are human and/or chimpanzee-specific and which are likely to have originated de novo from previously non-transcribed regions of the genome. We have observed an enrichment in transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions of these genes when compared to other species; this is consistent with the idea that the gain of new regulatory motifs results in de novo gene expression. We also show that some of the genes encode new functional proteins expressed in brain or testis, which may have contributed to phenotypic novelties in human evolution."

The mechanisms developed by pathogens to become resistant against existing drug treatments have been studied for many years but these studies have frequently scrutinized a few lines of the pathogen and rarely is it known whether the mechanisms identified occur in all pathogen populations present in endemic regions. In this study we assessed the diversity amongst drug-resistant parasites which emerged under treatment pressure in a natural parasite population. An extensive molecular and phenotypic characterisation of a collection of Leishmania donovani parasites isolated from leishmaniasis patients revealed that the parasites which are resistant to treatment have heterogeneous characters. The results provide evidence that how a parasite develops resistance under treatment pressure depends upon its genetic background. These findings provide key insights into the challenge that drug resistance poses for the control of infectious diseases like leishmaniasis.

We present in this study just such a tortuous natural selection pathway, which allows the mosquito Culex pipiens to resist organophosphorous insecticides. In the Montpellier area, following the use of insecticide to control mosquito populations, a high-resistance allele of the insecticide target enzyme appeared. But this allele also displayed strong deleterious side effects. Recently, several duplicated haplotypes began to spread in natural population that put in tandem a susceptible and a resistant allele. We show that the duplicated haplotypes actually display reduced side effects compared to the resistant allele when in the heterozygous state, but also new and strong costs in the homozygote. This pattern leads to an unexpected equilibrium between four different alleles across treated and nontreated areas. The story of resistance in C. pipiens is indeed far from a slow progression toward a “perfect” adaptation. Rather, selection for resistance to insecticide is a long process of trial and error leading to an uncommon genetic architecture."

On the flip side, during the last two decades, adenovirus vectors have become powerful tools to treat and address diseases of the CNS. Despite the fact that axonal transport of adenoviruses was reported more than 15 years ago, nothing was known concerning how adenoviruses access the CNS. The characterization of their interactions with brain cells was therefore long overdue. In this study, we describe the axonal trafficking of an adenovirus that preferentially infects neurons and reaches the CNS through long-range axonal transport. We show that this adenovirus exploits an endogenous vesicular pathway used by the adhesion molecule CAR (coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor). Our study characterizes this endogenous route of access, which is likely to be crucial to neuronal survival, neurodegenerative diseases, gene transfer vectors, and adenovirus-induced morbidity."

However, since cancer is a progressive disease that results from accumulation of multiple mutations likely acting in concert, individual markers can only provide limited insights into cellular mechanisms that underlie tumorigenesis. For this reason, recent studies focus on identification of “sub-network markers”, that is, functionally associated genes that exhibit coordinate changes in molecular expression during cancer progression. However, expression of genes is most frequently interrogated at the mRNA level, which captures functional activity of genes only to a limited extent. Screening of protein expression, on the other hand, provides information on the abundance of functional gene products, but its scale is often limited compared to screening of mRNA expression. In this article, we develop a proteomics-driven computational method that searches for sub-network markers in human colorectal cancer, based on a seed of differentially expressed proteins identified by proteomic screening. Our results show that significant changes in the expression of these proteins is likely to be associated with coordinate changes in the expression of the genes whose products are functionally associated with these proteins. This analysis leads to novel insights in the synergistic processes that underlie tumorigenesis."

Plant cellulose packs laterally into a complicated crystallographic structure, which determines cellulose quality and commercial uses. However, the mechanism of cellulose crystallization is poorly understood. Here we report that Brittle Culm1 (BC1), a COBRA-like (COBL) protein of rice, modifies cellulose crystallinity. Although previous studies have indicated the involvement of COB and COBL proteins in cellulose biosynthesis, the underlying molecular basis for this remains elusive. We demonstrate that BC1 localizes to the cell-wall and functions in a process that is distinct from that of the three secondary wall cellulose synthases (CESAs). A carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) at the N-terminus of BC1 interacts specifically with crystalline cellulose and regulates microfibril crystallite size. We conclude that BC1 modulates cellulose structure by binding to cellulose and affecting microfibril crystallinity. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of cellulose assembly and further our understanding of the roles of COB and COBLs in cell wall biogenesis."

However, neither the types nor the consequences of oxidative DNA damage in telomeres have been fully explored. Oxidative base lesions, especially 8-oxoG and FapyG are among the most common oxidative DNA damage. These guanine lesions are excised by a DNA glycosylase, OGG1, and subsequently replaced by normal guanines via BER pathway. Telomeric DNA is rich in guanine, and guanine base is prone to be oxidized to 8-oxoG and FapyG. To study if 8-oxoG and FapyG accumulate in telomeres and affect telomere integrity in mammals, we utilized a mouse model that was genetically deleted for the Ogg1 gene (it is thus defective in 8-oxoG and FapyG repair). We found that oxidative guanine lesions accumulated in telomeres in Ogg1 deficient mouse cells, which was associated with multiple telomere defects. These findings demonstrate that oxidative guanine damage can perturb telomere integrity and that BER pathway actively participates in oxidative base repair in telomeres in mammals. Our studies will be beneficial for uncovering the role of oxidative DNA damage and BER in mammalian telomeres."

Eukaryotes activate a surveillance mechanism, called DNA damage checkpoint, to arrest cell cycle progression and facilitate DNA repair. Several factors are physically recruited to DSBs, and specific kinases phosphorylate multiple targets leading to checkpoint activation. Budding yeast is a good model system to study checkpoint, and most of the factors involved in the DSBs response were originally characterized in this organism. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we explored the functional role of polo kinase Cdc5 in regulating the DSB–induced checkpoint. Polo kinases have been previously involved in checkpoint inactivation in all the eukaryotes, and they are frequently overexpressed in cancer cells. We found that elevated levels of Cdc5 affect the cellular response to a DSB at different steps, altering DNA processing and overriding the signal triggered by checkpoint kinases. Our findings suggest that Cdc5 likely regulates multiple factors in response to a DSB and provide a rationale for a proteome-wide screening to identify targets of polo kinases in yeast and human cells. Such information may have a practical application to design specific molecular tools for cancer therapy.

However, whether or not mispositioned myonuclei are a cause or consequence of muscle disease states is currently debated. Here, we take advantage of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, which shares the conserved myofiber found in mammalian systems, to identify Syd as a novel regulator of myonuclear positioning. We show that Syd is responsible for mediating the activities of Kinesin and Dynein, two motor proteins that exert forces to pull myonuclei into place. Moreover, we demonstrate that Syd-dependent myonuclear positioning also requires intracellular signaling from the JNK MAPK cascade to direct when and how myonuclei are moved into proper position. This work thus identifies developmental cues that direct proper muscle morphogenesis, suggesting that cases of muscle disease may result from a failure to achieve initial spacing of myonuclei. Supporting this notion, we find that loss of Syd impairs muscle function, but resupplying Syd restores proper myonuclear spacing and muscle function. These findings are particularly important as mispositioned myonuclei gain traction as a potential contributing factor in cases of muscle disease."

Here we characterize the changes in transcript expression that occur in the Malpighian tubules of adult female A. albopictus with the goal of identifying key molecular pathways that may reveal valuable targets for insecticide development. We find dramatic changes in transcript accumulation in Malpighian tubules, which 1) provide new insights into the potential functional roles of Malpighian tubules after a blood meal, and 2) reveal new potential molecular pathways and targets to guide the development of new insecticides that would disrupt the renal functions of mosquitoes."

However, current network biology studies typically assume that one gene encodes one protein isoform, ignoring the effect of alternative splicing. Alternative splicing allows a gene to produce multiple protein isoforms, by alternatively selecting distinct regions in the gene to be translated to protein products. Here, we present a computational method to predict and analyze the large-scale effect of alternative splicing on protein-protein interaction networks. Starting with a reference protein-protein interaction network determined by experiments, our method annotates protein-protein interactions with domain-domain interactions, and predicts that a protein isoform loses an interaction if it loses the domain mediating the interaction as a result of alternative splicing. Our predictions reveal the central role of alternative splicing in extensively remodeling the human protein-protein interaction network, and in increasing the functional complexity of the human cell. Our prediction method complements ongoing experimental efforts by predicting isoform-specific interactions for genes not tested yet by experiments and providing insights into the functional impact of alternative splicing."

In genetic sex determination (GSD), sex-specific differentiation results from intrinsic genetic differences between males and females, whereas environmental sex determination (ESD) relies on environmental signals to induce male or female sex determination. In contrast to model organisms that utilize GSD system, environmental sex-determining organisms are poor genetic models. Therefore, although candidate genes involved in ESD have been found in vertebrates, their functions have remained largely unknown, impairing our understanding of ESD and making the comparison of sex-determining genes between both systems difficult. Here, we report the identification of a gene responsible for the production of males during environmental sex determination in the crustacean Daphnia. This gene is homologous to the Doublesex gene that is functionally conserved in animals that use GSD. Expression of Doublesex was increased primarily in male-specific structures. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses established that Daphnia Doublesex gene is a major effector that regulates the male phenotype in Daphnia. We infer that there is an ancient, previously unidentified link between genetic and environmental sex determination."

Morphogens are signalling molecules that act in a concentration-dependent manner to induce the formation of different cell types. Members of the nodal family are thought to form a morphogen gradient in the developing zebrafish embryo and to be essential for pattern formation. Mesoderm and endoderm are believed to develop due to high levels of nodal signalling, while cells experiencing the lowest concentrations of nodal signalling become ectoderm. Although this idea is widely accepted, the formation of a nodal morphogen gradient has never been observed directly, and we have therefore used two different approaches to visualise the intensity of nodal signalling within individual cells. Our approaches have allowed us to visualise a gradient of nodal signalling activity in the developing zebrafish embryo. Quantification of the levels of nodal signalling experienced by individual cells confirms that nodal signalling patterns the animal-vegetal axis of the zebrafish embryo and, in contrast to previous studies, also suggests that it plays a role in patterning the dorso-ventral axis of the zebrafish embryo."

In an extreme case, a mutation may have no effect if it arises on one genetic background, but a strong effect on another background. Epistatic mutations in viruses and bacteria that live under severe conditions, such as antibiotic treatments or immune pressure, often allow pathogens to develop drug resistance or escape the immune system. In this paper we develop a new phylogenetic method for detecting epistasis, and we apply this method to the surface proteins of the influenza A virus, which are important targets of the immune system and drug treatments. The authors identify and characterize hundreds of epistatic mutations in these proteins. Among those identified, we find the specific epistatic mutations that were recently shown, experimentally, to confer resistance to the drug Tamiflu. The results of this study may help to predict the course of influenza's antigenic evolution and to select more appropriate vaccines and drugs."

Several Salmonella serotype-specific PCR assays have been published and even used directly on biological samples, but none has been validated on a large collection of strains to check for reliability and robustness. We report here the successful development of conventional and real-time PCR assays for the identification of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates.

We systematically evaluate the accuracy and robustness of our method and apply it to modern European genomes to uncover signals of introgression which we confirm to be from a population related to Neanderthals."

For T. gondii, laboratory studies have demonstrated that the sexual stage can serve the dual purpose of producing new, virulent genotypes through recombination and promoting expansion of single clones via self-mating. Self-mating and other life history traits of T. gondii, including transmission of asexual stages among intermediate hosts, are assumed to account for the clonal population genetic structure of this organism. However, the relative contributions of sexual recombination and self-mating verses other life history traits in causing disease outbreaks or in shaping Toxoplasma's population genetic structure have not been verified in nature, nor have these traits been extensively examined in related parasites. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted population genetic analyses on T. gondii and S. neurona strains isolated from naturally occurring outbreaks affecting humans and sea otters, respectively. Our results identify self-mating as a key trait potentiating disease outbreaks through the rapid amplification of a single clone into millions of infectious units. Selfing is likely a key adaptation for enhancing transmission of recently emerged, recombinant clones and reshaping population genetic structures among the tissue-cyst coccidia."

Genomic information available for five reference Paracoccidioides isolates could greatly assist researchers in developing new chemotherapeutic approaches against PCM, but usefulness of such data is limited, since ~60–90% of Paracoccidioides protein-coding genes (depending on isolate) are described as responsible for hypothetical proteins, without any functional/structural description. Such elevated number of hypothetical proteins is unexpected and probably derives from annotations performed solely by automated computing pipelines. This problem can be minimized by manual curation, when expert reviewers determine the functional designation of each gene, after comparing results derived from several reference databases. This work describes an effort to review the functional assignment of >40,000 genes, annotated across the five Paracoccidioides genomes mentioned above, which reduced the number of hypothetical proteins to ~25–28%, contributing to significantly increase quality and usefulness of such genomic information. These data have been compiled in a relational database named ParaDB, constituting an important resource for researchers in the field."

Human mate choice is characterized by the phenomenon of “like attracts like,” meaning that partners resemble each other in multiple ways (“assortative mating”). Assortative mating is also frequently reported for birds, but it is unclear whether this in turn implies that birds also have preferences for a similar partner. Here, we show that a range of methodological issues may provide a simpler and more accurate explanation for the frequent observation of assortative mating in birds. First, studies that report assortative mating may achieve greater visibility than studies that yield no such finding. Hence, the scientific literature may be biased toward positive results. Second, in field studies, it is logistically impossible to measure all birds accurately and under standardized conditions. Hence, fluctuations in, for instance, environmental conditions may induce a spurious similarity between partners when these are measured together in space or time. After accounting for such methodological issues, we conclude that mate preferences for a similar partner may be less common than previously thought."

These proteins are typically localized to stacked membranes in photoreceptors. In flies, upon light exposure, Rhodopsin undergoes conformational changes and becomes active as metarhodopsin. Metarhodopsin then initiates a signaling cascade that activates the photoreceptor cell. To deactivate the light response, metarhodopsin is converted back into Rhodopsin by absorption of another photon of light. Under certain conditions, metarhodopsin cannot be converted back to Rhodopsin, and it is then endocytosed and degraded. Rhodopsin then needs to be synthesized and delivered back to the membrane stacks. Here, we show that the Calmodulin-binding protein Crag is required for the delivery of newly made Rhodopsin to the membrane stacks. Loss of Crag leads to the accumulation of Rhodopsin in the cytosol, followed by shrinkage of membrane stack volume, and, eventually, photoreceptor cell degeneration. We also show that Crag activates a target protein, Rab11, which mediates the vesicular transport of Rhodospin to the membrane. Finally, we document that the human homolog of Crag, DENND4A, is able to rescue the loss of Crag in flies, suggesting that DENND4A functions in a similar process in vertebrates."

Respiratory melioidosis has also been highlighted as a concern in the biodefense community given the potential for weaponization of B. pseudomallei. This study demonstrates that respiratory melioidosis models can significantly vary in their disease presentations in mice, depending on whether the upper respiratory tract represents an initial site of infection. We have demonstrated that lung-specific infections of mice, which avoid nasal cavity colonization, result in a course of disease with greater maturation of pneumonia and systemic spread, and we propose that this represents a critical advance in the field of studying respiratory melioidosis. We further characterize that the capsule virulence determinant, previously considered important for respiratory melioidosis, has reduced significance when characterized in the context of lung-specific disease, while the Type 3 Secretion System cluster 3 is a critical virulence determinant for B. pseudomallei required for efficient colonization of the lung as well as spread to other tissues."

We demonstrated that exposure of pigs through the nose with H5N1 viruses or consumption of meat from infected chickens resulted in infection with mild weight loss. In contrast to mouse and ferret animal models where some of viruses were highly pathogenic and replicated in multiple organs, replication of H5N1 viruses in pigs was restricted to the respiratory tract, mainly to the lungs, and tonsils.

Among them, visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of the disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Currently chemotherapeutic agents are highly toxic and suffer from extensive drug resistance. However, the development of a safe and effective vaccine has to deal with the complications erased from the different immune responses of the human population. It is suggested that a solution to that problem is the design of candidate vaccines containing appropriate multi-epitope peptides for the induction of protective immunity. Furthermore, the selection of proper adjuvant and biocompatible delivery systems for the peptide(s) chosen should enhance their immunogenic potential. Subsequently, for this work, we used a synthetic peptide designed to contain overlapping epitopes obtained from the sequence of a known immunogenic Leishmania protein, Cysteine Protease A (CPA). The peptide was selected to be delivered along with MPLA adjuvant co-encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles. The data presented in this study show the immunogenicity and the prophylactic potential of the proposed nanovaccine against L. infantum in the susceptible model of visceral leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice, further suggesting that rationally designed peptide-based nanovaccines are promising vaccine candidates against leishmaniasis."

However, the genetic components of the Roma have not been deeply characterized. Our study reveals a common South Asian origin of all European Roma, closely related to a Punjabi group from Northwestern India. Through fine-scale haplotype-based methods, we describe a complex West Eurasian genetic component in the Roma groups, identifying a common Balkan ancestry and country-specific admixture footprints consistent with the dispersion through Europe. Our findings provide new insights into the demographic history and recent admixture events that have shaped the genetic composition of European Roma groups and could enable a better genetic characterization of complex disease in this population."

This causes gene dosage differences that must be compensated for by adjusting the expression of most genes located on the X-chromosome. Long non-coding RNAs are central in this compensation and in fruit flies this is mediated by two non-coding RNAs, roX1 and roX2 which together with five proteins form the male-specific lethal complex. The complex recognizes and upregulates gene transcription on the male X-chromosome. While non-coding RNAs are are engaged in numerous biological processes and critical for compensation their precise functions remain elusive. To understand the function of long non-coding RNAs we analysed the expression of all genes in roX1, roX2 and roX1 roX2 mutants to explore the roles of long non-coding RNAs. These mutants have different impacts on the genome-wide expression. Our results also suggest that the X-chromosome is highly tolerant to mis-expression and we speculate that this tolerance evolved in parallel with compensation mechanisms and may be a common property of sex-chromosomes. We propose that dosage compensation is a stochastic process that depends on the distribution of specific binding sites which will be selected for and optimized depending on the genes’ individual expression levels."

We find that [PSI+] variants (including the rare [PSI+] from wild yeasts) show different transmission patterns from one Sup35 sequence to another. Moreover, we find segregation of different prion variants on mitotic growth and evidence for generation of new variants with growth under non-selective conditions. This data supports the “prion cloud” model, that prions are not uniform structures but have an array of related self-propagating amyloid structures."

Worldwide, the promotion of integrated pest management practices has been heavily promoted through participative methodologies relying on farmer cooperation to share pest control information. Recent studies have put into doubt the efficiency of such methodologies evoking our poor knowledge of farmers' perceptions, behavioral heterogeneity, and complex interaction with pest dynamics. While pest management programs have a larger place than ever on the international policy agenda, the debate concerning their efficiency at large scales has remained unresolved. Here, we developed an innovative modeling approach coupling pest control information diffusion and pest population dynamics to study the role of cooperation among farmers to share the information. We found that the slow learning process placed restrictions on the knowledge that could be generated within farmer communities over time, giving rise to natural lags in pest control diffusion and applications. However, our model also predicts that if individuals learn from others about the benefits of early prevention of invasive pests, then a temporary educational effort may have a sustainable long-run impact."

In this study, we experimentally determined molecular parameters of the HIV-1-antibody interaction, and subsequently used this knowledge to devise a mathematical model of HIV-1 infection and antibody neutralization in vivo. First, we experimentally confirmed that binding of one antibody per HIV-1 envelope trimer is sufficient for trimer neutralization. This finding, in combination with the number of trimers per HIV-1 virion, the number of trimers required for virus entry, and the affinity of antibody-trimer binding, enabled precise modelling of HIV-1 antibody neutralization. We employed our model for a post-hoc analysis of non-human primate infection studies, thereby obtaining estimates of HIV-1 neutralization in vivo and the probability for a single HIV-1 virion to initiate host infection. We further modelled HIV-1 infection and antibody neutralization during male-to-female transmission in the human host, which delivered estimates for the likelihood of HIV-1 transmission per sexual act and predictions of protective mucosal antibody concentrations. The quantitative insights into HIV-1 infection and antibody neutralization derived here, spanning from the molecular to the systemic level, contribute to a refined understanding of HIV-1 transmission and may prove useful for pre-study planning or post-hoc analyses of HIV-1 clinical trials and vaccine studies."

These intracellular bacteria include endosymbionts like Buchnera aphidicola, which provides its host, an aphid, with essential amino acids, as well as many pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agents of leprosy and typhus, respectively. Even though they all evolved their intracellular lifestyle independently, all these bacteria lost a large number of genes as they adapted to their hosts, presumably because the rich environment where they found themselves no longer required such functions. For example, biosynthetic genes are frequently lost. It has been a matter of debate what decides whether a gene can be lost in evolution, and intracellular bacteria have been used as model systems to study these processes. In our study, we propose that when adopting an intracellular lifestyle, these bacteria extensively lost duplicated genes. We propose that this represents loss of copy redundancy that is possible because the host cell represents a predictable environment in which there is little pressure for the bacteria to retain these backups. In simplistic terms, if the road is always smooth, you are probably OK without a spare tire."

Alphaherpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) cause many diseases upon productive infection in epithelial cells, fibroblasts and neurons. Here, we asked which nuclear transport factors of the host cells help HSV-1 to translocate viral components into the nucleus for viral gene expression, nuclear capsid assembly, capsid egress into the cytoplasm, and production of infectious virions. Our data show that HSV-1 requires the nuclear import factor importin α1 for efficient replication and virus assembly in fibroblasts and in mature neurons. To our knowledge this is the first time that a specific importin α isoform is shown to be required for herpesvirus infection. Our study fosters our understanding on how the different but highly homologous importin α isoforms could fulfill specific functions in vivo which are only understood for a very limited number of host and viral cargos."

There has been considerable interest in identifying mechanisms that link metabolic signals to circadian time keeping. mTOR (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a major intracellular sensor that integrates nutrient and energy status to fundamental cellular processes. Previous studies have identified a key role for mTOR in regulating photic entrainment and synchrony of the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Given that mTOR activities exhibit robust circadian rhythms in a variety of cells and tissues including the SCN, here we investigated the role of mTOR in orchestrating autonomous functions in central and peripheral circadian clocks. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches we show that mTOR inhibition slows down the circadian clock and dampens clock oscillations, whereas mTOR activation accelerates the clock and enhances clock oscillations in cells, tissues as well as in mice. Together, these results support a significant role for mTOR in linking metabolic states to circadian time keeping."

There is well-established theory that predicts that adaptive diversification can arise because of ecological interactions between individuals, such as competition or predation, but there are no empirical examples in which this process has been observed at the genetic level. We documented the genetic basis of adaptive diversification resulting from competition for resources in populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli. The populations diversified into two coexisting ecotypes representing different physiological adaptations. We found that similar but independently evolved phenotypes often shared mutations in the same gene and, in four cases, shared identical mutations at the same nucleotide position. Timelines of allele frequencies extracted from the frozen “fossil record” of three evolving populations showed parallel evolutionary dynamics, suggesting that mutations causing one type of physiology changed the ecological environment and allowed invasion of mutations causing an alternate physiology. The results provide empirical evidence of adaptive diversification as a predictable evolutionary process."

ESCs, therefore, have been the focus of intense biological and medical interests. A remarkable feature of ESCs is their phenotypic heterogeneity: ESCs show large cell-to-cell fluctuation in the expression level of Nanog, which is a key factor to maintain pluripotency. Since Nanog regulates many genes in ESCs, this fluctuation should seriously affect individual cells when they start differentiation. In this paper we analyze this phenotypic fluctuation by simulating the stochastic dynamics of gene network in ESCs. The model takes account of the mutually interrelated processes of gene regulation such as binding/unbinding of transcription factors, formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus, and histone-code modification. We show the distribution of timescales of these processes is decisively important to characterize the dynamical behavior of the gene network, and that the slow formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus at the Nanog locus explains the observed large fluctuation of ESCs. The epigenetic landscapes are calculated based on the stochastic simulation, and the role of the phenotypic fluctuation in the differentiation process is analyzed through the landscape picture."

Depletion of mtDNA has been associated with mutations in several genes, which encode either proteins directly involved in mtDNA replication or factors regulating the homeostasis of the mitochondrial deoxynucleotide pool. However, for some genes the mechanism linking mutations and mtDNA depletion is not known. One such gene is MPV17, whose loss-of-function causes mtDNA abnormalities in human, mouse and yeast. Here we show that MPV17 dysfunction leads to a shortage of the precursors for DNA synthesis in the mitochondria, slowing DNA replication in the organelle. Not only does mtDNA copy number correlate with dNTP pool size in both mouse tissues and human cells, deoxynucleoside supplementation of the growth medium prevents depletion and restores mtDNA copy number in quiescent MPV17-deficient cells. Hence, our study links MPV17 deficiency, insufficiency of mitochondrial dNTPs, and slow replication in mitochondria to depletion of mtDNA manifesting in the human disease, and places MPV17-related disease firmly in the category of mtDNA disorders caused by deoxynucleotide perturbation. The prevention and reversal of mtDNA loss in MPV17 patient-derived cells identifies potential therapeutic strategy for a currently untreatable disease."

Recent studies have revealed that such packing of DNA is not random but instead structured into functional DNA loops. Those loops are essential to numerous key processes in the cell, such as genome expression and DNA replication. In addition, disruption of DNA loops can lead to genetic diseases and cancers. Understanding how DNA loops are formed and what are their molecular determinants is thus a fundamental issue. In this work, we propose a computational model to identify the molecular determinants of loops, including protein and DNA sequence. Most notably, the model offers insights in the different mechanistic scenarios behind loop formation. Using this model, we uncover numerous novel DNA loops and underlying mechanisms in Drosophila and human. We find that the orientation-dependent specificity between CTCF motifs is conserved in metazoans. We show how loops between DNA-binding proteins can be mediated by additional cofactors. Our analyses further reveal opposite influences of transcription factors depending on RNA Polymerase II pausing."

This decision making process is complex, involving both intracellular constraints and the organism’s perception of the environment. To begin to mimic the complexity of natural environments, we grew cells in mixtures of two sugars, glucose and galactose. We find that in mixed environments, the sugar concentration at which cells decides to induce galactose-utilizing (GAL) genes is highly variable in natural isolates of yeast. By analyzing crosses of phenotypically different strains, we identified a locus containing the galactose sensor, a gene that in theory could allow cells to tune their perception of the environment. We confirmed that the galactose sensor can explain upwards of 90% of the variation in the decision to induce GAL genes. Finally, we show that the variation in the galactose sensor can modulate the time required for cells to switch from utilizing glucose to galactose. Our results suggest that signaling pathways can be highly variable across strains and thereby might allow for rapid adaption in fluctuating environments."

Experiments using microbial signaling systems show that group-level changes in cellular state occur in either a graded or an all-or-none fashion. We show that the type of group-level decision making used by populations is uniquely determined by a single dimensionless parameter that compares the quorum-signaling molecules accumulated within the cells with those secreted by the population. Bacterial quorum-sensing circuits appear to be tuned so that the cells can convert between the two types of decision-making in response to slight biochemical variations. Furthermore, the role of the parameter is universal such that it not only applies to the autoinducing circuits typically found in bacteria but also to the more complex gene circuits involved in transmembrane receptor signaling and negative feedback. The design principle that we describe thus serves as the basis for the analysis and control of collective cellular decision making in general."

Recently, prion-like transmission has been found in various amyloidoses. AApoAII amyloid fibrils in mouse senile amyloidosis have exhibited transmissibility. For instance, ingested AApoAII amyloid fibrils, which were excreted from mice and contained in feces or milk, function as seeds for changing apoA-II amyloid precursor protein to the fibrillar form and cause mouse senile amyloidosis. However, transmissibility through other pathways has not yet been established. Here, we induced AApoAII systemic amyloidosis in transgenic Apoa2cTg+/− and normal R1.P1-Apoa2c mice to analyze the transmissibility of mouse senile amyloidosis through muscle tissues. In this study, we not only detected AApoAII deposited in various skeletal muscles, but also found that it could induce secondary transmission of AApoAII amyloidosis. This is the first evidence of transmission through skeletal muscles in non-prion systemic amyloidosis. This pathway of transmission provides new insight into the potential for food-borne pathogenesis and etiology of systemic amyloidosis."

Upon acute infection, only about 30% of patients are able to eliminate the virus spontaneously while about 70% of patients develop chronic infection. It is known that a successful immune response against HCV depends on virus-specific CD8+ T cells. However, during chronic infection, these cells are impaired in their antiviral function. In this study, we found that the exhaustion is characterized by the expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, 2B4, CD160 and KLRG1. Of note, the coexpression of these receptors depends on the ongoing recognition of the viral antigen and the maturation stage of the T cell. The remaining virus-specific T cell responses that are not exhausted do not recognize the virus present in the patients any more due to viral mutations, indicating viral escape. Thus, they fail to exert antiviral activity, although they share characteristics of fully functional memory T cells. In sum, we have found that T cell exhaustion contributes to the failure of about half of HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses and that it is determined by a complex interplay of immunological and virological factors. These findings will be important to consider in the design of new antiviral vaccination strategies."

In most CF patients, the clinical course is dominated by lung disease and recurrent pulmonary bacterial infections. Many CF patients also have significant skeletal muscle wasting and weakness, and this can affect the most essential breathing muscle, the diaphragm. Although muscle wasting in CF has generally been attributed to factors such as reduced physical activity and poor nutrition, our study reveals an intrinsic defect of skeletal muscle function caused by the lack of CFTR. Hence, we show that CFTR is normally found in skeletal muscle fibers of humans and mice. In CF muscle cells lacking CFTR, abnormal elevations of calcium and inflammatory gene expression are found. In addition, during pulmonary infections, diaphragm muscles lacking CFTR show greater weakness and induction of genes which cause muscle atrophy. These findings extend our understanding of the factors leading to exercise limitation and disability in CF and also have implications for the pathogenesis of respiratory muscle failure in CF patients during lung infections."

It is the most common skin disease, affecting up to 80% of individuals at some point between the ages of 11 and 30 years. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) plays a role in the development of inflammatory acne lesions, but whether it causes inflammation by itself or through indirect mechanisms is not clear yet. Therefore, by exposing epidermal cells to P. acnes in vitro, we tested whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (oxidative burst) was involved in the inflammatory process. We found that one particular ROS, superoxide anion, was generated by epidermal cells following P. acnes stimulation. This phenomenon is associated with the production of a soluble pro inflammatory molecule, IL-8, and epidermal cell death. The abrogation of P. acnes-induced oxidative burst by the most commonly used and most efficient treatments of acne suggests that superoxide anions produced by epidermal cells are critical in the development of acne inflammatory lesions."

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a cancer-causing herpesvirus and can lead to development of Kaposi’s sarcoma, a major form of cancer in HIV-positive patients. As for all herpesviruses, infection with KSHV is lifelong. Exactly how KSHV initiates and maintains its infection is still not well understood, but it must manipulate the host cell to establish favorable conditions. Likewise, the host has developed a complicated system to fight off invaders, which includes the production of interferon-stimulated gene products. We have now found that KSHV exploits one such host cell protein, the oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL). Rather than OASL acting as an antiviral protein as it does during many other viral infections, KSHV appears to have found a way to utilize OASL for its own benefit. The KSHV protein ORF20 interacts with OASL, they co-localize in nucleoli, and both ORF20 and OASL associate and purify with components of the cellular translational machinery. This may help viral infection by selectively controlling protein production."

We study the histone demethylase Jarid1b (Kdm5b/Plu1), as it has been reported to be highly expressed in several human cancers and therefore might present a novel target for anti-cancer therapies. To gain insights into the physiological role of Jarid1b, we have generated a Jarid1b knockout mouse. We show that loss of Jarid1b affects survival of newborn mice and that Jarid1b is required for the faithful development of several neural organs. To understand how Jarid1b regulates embryogenesis, we identified genes with increased H3K4me3 at a genome-wide scale as well as Jarid1b target genes during development. In Jarid1b knockout embryos, master regulators of neural development are expressed at higher levels, underscoring the importance of Jarid1b in transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we extend previous reports of overlapping Jarid1b and Polycomb target genes to show the functional relevance of this observation. Our results provide the first detailed analysis of the role of Jarid1b in normal development and provide a basis for further studies evaluating the contribution of Jarid1b to tumorigenesis."

Chemotaxis allows bacteria to sense chemical gradients but their ecological distribution, e.g. whether natural gradients sensed by E. coli change slowly or rapidly in space and time, is unknown. That distribution matters, as it controls constraints and selective pressure acting on the pathway. We used microfluidic devices to generate controlled chemoattractant gradients and measure the speed of bacterial climbing of those gradients. We could thereby assay the impact of adaptation properties of the chemotaxis pathway onto the progression of gradient climbing. We specifically show that loss of adaptation, induced by adding a background of serine to gradients of aspartate, leads to a faster progression of the bacteria along the chemoattractant gradient. We finally discuss why our experiments suggest that ecological conditions are likely to involve chemoattractant profiles more complex than constant gradients usually considered in the laboratory."

Prioritization of these polymorphisms is challenged, though, by the lack of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of gene regulation and the paucity of characterized regulatory polymorphisms. Our work attempts to address this issue by assembling a collection of regulatory polymorphisms from the existing literature. Furthermore, we use this collection to investigate and prioritize various properties that may be important for identifying novel regulatory polymorphisms."

Polarized growth, where growth is restricted to defined regions, leads to the specific cell shape of yeast cells, as well as the very long hyphae of filamentous fungi. Fungal polar growth is controlled by an internal regulatory circuit of which the microtubule cytoskeleton comprises the transport road for numerous cargos needed for polarized growth. However, the microtubule cytoskeleton is not static, but a dynamic structure, which is modulated by microtubule-associated proteins and the interaction with other cellular structures. Our present analysis has identified a new regulator of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the fission yeast S. pombe: a member of the highly conserved Vip1 inositol polyphosphate kinase family. Vip1 proteins have a dual domain structure consisting of an N-terminal kinase domain which synthesizes inositol pyrophosphates and a C-terminal domain, which we show to negatively regulate the kinase output. Our results suggest that modulation of microtubule dynamics is correlated to Vip1 kinase activity. Importantly, polarized growth and microtubule dynamics were also modulated by Vip1 family members in A. nidulans and U. maydis thus uncovering a conserved biological role for inositol pyrophosphates."

The driving force for growth in these organisms is the difference in osmotic pressure (turgor) between the inside of the cell and the external medium, a force contained by the cell wall. Physical laws imply that the higher the curvature of the cell, the lower the pressure (stress) perceived by the cell wall. Paradoxically, growth takes place at the dome-shaped cell apex, which has high curvature. Tip-growing cells studied so far (mainly plants) compensate the low wall stress in the apex by chemically loosening their cell wall. We studied Ectocarpus, which is a representative of brown algae, a eukaryotic branch very divergent from land plants, fungi, and green algae. We carried out a series of quantitative measurements at the cellular level and showed that the cell wall is thinner at the tip (36 nm) than on the shanks (170 to 500 nm). Using a viscoplastic model of cell wall expansion, we showed that the cell wall thickness gradient, together with dome curvature, generates sufficient wall stress to account for the observed growth pattern."

This approach, however, potentially obscures meaningful brain dynamics that unfold on the single-trial level. Single-trial analyses have been successfully applied to time domain or low frequency oscillatory activity; its application to MEG high frequency activity is hindered by the low amplitude of these signals. In the present study, we show that stimulus modality (visual versus auditory presentation of words) can successfully be decoded from single-trial MEG high frequency activity by combining source reconstruction with a random forest classification algorithm. This approach reveals patterns of activity above 75 Hz in both visual and auditory cortex, highlighting the importance of high frequency activity for the processing of domain-specific stimuli. Thereby, our results extend prior findings by revealing high-frequency activity in auditory cortex related to auditory word stimuli in MEG data.

The model has a cascade architecture, consisting of two stages of linear and nonlinear operations. A novel component of the model is a nonlinear operation that generates selectivity for second-order contrast, that is, variations in contrast-energy across the visual field. We find that this nonlinearity is stronger in extrastriate areas V2 and V3 than in primary visual cortex V1.

Haustoria are targets of plant defence responses, including the deposition of membranes and polysaccharides in an encasement structure that surrounds the haustorium. It is assumed that the encasement physically seals the haustorium off from the host cell. Here we have used cell biological and genetic approaches to reveal that the plasmodesmata-associated receptor-like protein PDLP1 plays a role in infection success of the Arabidopsis downy mildew pathogen, specifically in the development of the encasement. Using live cell imaging, we observed that PDLP1 relocates to the extra-haustorial membrane, and this is required for deposition of the polysaccharide callose in the encasement. This directly correlates pathogen success with the structure of the encasement, verifying the significance of the encasement in host defence. Further, our data pose the possibility that callose deposition at plasmodesmata and the haustorial encasement exploit similar mechanisms. Our findings shed light on plant defences at haustoria and how they inhibit pathogen success."

Like many poxviruses, VACV produces a wide variety of proteins that inhibit parts of the host response to infection. Consequently, the virus can escape destruction by the immune system and be passed on to additional hosts. Here we report a new VACV immune evasion mechanism mediated by protein B14, a protein that contributes to virus virulence. B14 functions by interacting with a cellular protein called IKKβ, which is critical for mounting an innate immune response to infection, and also plays important roles in cancer and cell death. B14 prevents IKKβ being activated and consequently the cellular signaling pathway leading to activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is not induced. Without activation of NF-κB the host cell cannot produce other molecules that amplify the innate immune response to infection. This mechanism of action of B14 fits nicely with the observed increase in the host response to infection by a VACV strain lacking the B14R gene. Lastly, an increased understanding of how B14 inhibits IKKβ function may lead to development of novel drugs against this important cellular enzyme."

The importance of IKAROS expression levels for the control of target-gene regulation was addressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. The collaboration between IKAROS and the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex can promote gene activation or repression. IKAROS can also interact with the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) and the Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), an important P-TEFb regulator. Immunoaffinity purification of IKAROS interacting proteins and Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography analysis revealed a dynamic interaction between IKAROS, PP1 and the newly defined NuRD-P-TEFb complex. This complex can be targeted to specific genes in cells expressing high levels of IKAROS to promote productive transcription elongation. Based on our results we suggest that, in addition to P-TEFb, the NuRD complex and PP1 are required to facilitate transcription elongation of IKAROS-target genes and normal differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells."

Importantly, when such a network is presented with part of a memory, the network activity is attracted to the complete memory. However, it has been difficult to obtain clear experimental evidence for such attractor networks. Indeed, recent “morphing” experiments that were specifically designed to observe these attractor dynamics in the hippocampus did not obtain the expected results, leading to a controversy on the validity of the attractor hypothesis of memory. Here, we have built a computational model of the relevant hippocampal areas, including its core anatomical and physiological features, and through the use of large-scale computer simulations reveal in detail the physiological properties expected of the hippocampal attractor network during morphing experiments. We show that the experimental results obtained are actually those to be expected of an attractor network when the specifics of the experimental protocol are taken into account. Most importantly, the results directly demonstrate the attraction of CA3 activity to a stored pattern. Our results, together with previous behavioral and in vitro studies, provide strong evidence that CA3 is an attractor network for associative memory."

Although formation of the “zipper-like” structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC) is critical for homologous chromosome synapsis in most sexually reproducing organisms, regulation of SC formation is still poorly understood. Previous studies revealed that whereas SC formation is dependent on the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in yeast, plants, and mammals, it is DSB-independent in flies and nematodes. Here we introduce CRA-1, a novel and conserved protein required for the formation of the SC in the nematode C. elegans. In cra-1 mutants, SC central region components for the most part fail to link homologous chromosome axes and stabilize homologous pairing interactions. As a result, crossover recombination is impaired and there is increased chromosome nondisjunction. Analysis of cra-1 mutants also reveals that DSB formation and repair can promote the assembly of SC proteins along chromosome axes. Therefore, we propose that CRA-1 promotes a productive SC assembly, and demonstrate, in our analysis of cra-1 mutants, an unanticipated interconnection between the recruitment of central region components onto chromosome axes and the recombination pathway in C. elegans."

The cornerstone of population genetics, this law states that the evolutionary fate of genetic variants is solely governed by their contribution to the good of their carriers. However, meiotic drive genes—which skew transmission in their own favor—can evolve under certain circumstances, even though they cause harm to the genome as a whole. Meiotic drive elements are often enriched on the two sex chromosomes (i.e., the X and the Y) because of a lack of recombination between them. Here we describe the genetic and molecular characterization of a meiotic drive distorter on the X chromosome in Drosophila simulans. This distorter apparently formed de nova from yet another new gene. To fight back against this harmful distorter, the D. simulans genome has evolved an ingenious mechanism based on DNA sequence homology. We postulate that repeated meiotic drive invasion and its suppression could be a major mechanism for genome evolution, underlying the ultimate cause for the inactivation of sex chromosome during meiosis and the occasional loss of recombination (achiasmy), which is observed only in the heterogametic (XY) sex."

However, most of these methods ignore the regulatory relationships and functional interactions among genes. In this article, we propose a statistical method that can explicitly model the interactions of genes in a neighborhood defined by the topology of a pathway. Simulation studies and a real data example show that the proposed method can improve the power of identifying associated genes when they are in the neighborhood of other genes whose association has been firmly established in previous studies."

The facilities also result in the generation of large volumes of highly contaminated fecal waste that represents a potential basis for further disease transmission.

Even where the pathogen of concern is not waterborne, health-care providers have a ‘duty-of-care’ to protect workers and neighboring communities from all excreta-borne diseases. In this study, the authors successfully demonstrated, for the first time, the in situ disinfection of wastewaters from cholera treatment centers during the Haiti cholera outbreak, using a low-cost physicochemical method. The approach is currently being adapted by NGOs to help manage human excreta in other emergency settings, including the current Ebola outbreak. Although the Ebola virus is relatively fragile, it may exist in high concentrations in the bodily fluids (including feces) of those with the disease. The approach to in situ disinfection of excreta described here may therefore support infection control in outbreaks of Ebola and other infectious diseases."

We found that TIE1 (TCP interactor containing EAR motif protein 1) plays an important role in the control of shoot branching in Arabidopsis. Higher TIE1 expression levels lead to bushier Arabidopsis plants. TIE1 directly interacts with BRC1 and represses BRC1 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, BRC1 downstream target genes are downregulated by TIE1. Our findings demonstrate that TIE1 acts as a key repressor of BRC1 activity and positively regulates shoot branching."

There is no vaccine for leishmaniasis and control measures are not effective in part because it is not known the reservoirs of L. braziliensis. Here, we show that dogs, living in houses in an area of L. braziliensis transmission presented cutaneous and mucosal ulcers similar to the one presented by humans. In all the houses with canine CL there were active or past history of cases of human CL, and L. braziliensis isolated from dogs were genetically similar to the one from humans. These data are in favor of the participation of dogs in the transmission of L. braziliensis and may have a great importance in the control of the expansion of L. braziliensis infection."

Immediately after the parasite enters a cell, IRG proteins accumulate on the membrane of the vacuole in which the organism resides. Within a few hours the vacuole membrane breaks down and the parasite dies. A puzzle is why this mechanism works on Toxoplasma, but only on one other organism among the many tested, namely the bacterial species, Chlamydia. What do these widely different parasites have in common that so many other bacteria and protozoa lack? Neither Toxoplasma nor Chlamydia is taken up by conventional phagocytosis. In this paper we suggest that this is an important clue by showing that a microsporidian, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a highly-divergent fungal parasite, which also invades cells bypassing phagocytosis, is resisted by the IRG system. Therefore, we propose here the “missing self” principle: IRG proteins bind to vacuolar membranes only in the absence of a host derived inhibitor that is present on phagosomal membranes but excluded from the plasma membrane invaginated by IRG target organisms during non-phagosomal entry."

Here we discuss scenarios where the nature of the genetic association with the causal trait can lead existing causal inference methods to give the wrong direction of causality. We introduce a new method that can be applied to summary level data and is potentially less susceptible to problems such as measurement error, and apply it to evaluate the causal relationships between DNA methylation levels and gene expression.

The form of the parasite transmitted by the mosquito, the so-called sporozoite, needs motility to enter the salivary glands, to migrate within the skin and to enter into blood capillaries and eventually hepatocytes, where the parasites differentiate into thousands of merozoites that invade red blood cells. Sporozoite motility is based on an actin-myosin motor, as is the case in many other eukaryotic cells. However, most eukaryotic cells move much slower than sporozoites. How these parasites reach their high speed is not clear but current evidence suggests that actin filaments need to be organized by either actin-binding proteins or membrane proteins that link the filaments to an extracellular substrate.The present study explores the role of the actin filament-binding protein coronin in the motility of sporozoites of the rodent model parasite Plasmodium berghei. We found that the deletion of P. berghei coronin leads to defects in parasite motility and thus lower infection of mosquito salivary glands, which translates into less efficient transmission of the parasites. Our experiments suggest that coronin organizes actin filaments to achieve rapid and directional motility. We also identify two signaling pathways that converge to regulate actin filament dynamics and suggest that they play a role in switching the parasite from its motility mode to a cell invasion mode."

These gradients are noisy however, raising the question of how sharply delineated boundaries between distinct segments form. It is crucial that developing systems be able to cope with stochasticity and generate well-defined boundaries between different segmented domains. Previous work suggests that cell sorting and cellular plasticity help sharpen boundaries between segments. However, it remains unclear how effective each of these mechanisms is and what their role in sharpening may be. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we construct a hybrid stochastic model to investigate these questions. We find that neither mechanism is sufficient on its own to sharpen boundaries between different segments. Rather, results indicate each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and that they work together synergistically to promote the development of precise, well defined segment boundaries. Formation of segmented rhombomeres in the zebrafish hindbrain, which later form different components of the central nervous system, is a motivating case for this study."

Treatment with either rifampin plus streptomycin or, more recently, rifampin plus clarithromycin requires taking the drugs daily for 8 weeks. Streptomycin is administered by injection and may result in hearing loss. Clarithromycin often causes gastrointestinal discomfort. Our goal is to identify a regimen that is both shorter and associated with fewer side effects. Rifampin, previously an expensive drug, is well tolerated not only at the standard dose of 10 mg/kg but at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg. The related rifamycin, rifapentine, has a longer half-life and is also well tolerated. We tested in a mouse model of Buruli ulcer whether higher doses of these rifamycins together with clofazimine, a drug that has transient skin pigmentation side effects but no toxicities, could effectively reduce lesion size, the number of bacteria, and production of the mycolactone toxin, in a shorter time than that for the existing drug regimens.

In response, plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that can interfere with various steps of the silencing pathway. Mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) is a plant bipartite geminivirus responsible for a devastating disease in some areas of tropics and sub-tropics where its natural host, Vigna mungo, is a staple food crop. We discovered that the MYMV-encoded AC4 protein is a determinant of pathogenicity, binds native 21–25 nt siRNAs in vitro, and counteracts virus induced gene silencing by strongly suppressing the systemic phase of silencing but not the local production of siRNA. MYMV AC4 undergoes palmitoylation, a post-translational modification never reported before for plant viral proteins that mediates specific localization of the protein to the plasma membrane (PM). Interestingly, palmitoylation and in turns PM localization is indispensable for direct VSR function of AC4. AC4 also binds the PM-located BAM1, a trigger of cell-to-cell spread of RNAi. Taken together our results suggest that AC4 has synergic mechanisms of action, based on the specific PM localization, to prevent spreading of antiviral RNAi silencing in not yet infected cells."

The opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa can cause both acute and chronic infections, and the trajectory of these two types of infections is vastly different. We used high-throughput sequencing to profile P. aeruginosa genome-wide gene expression and mutant fitness during mouse model acute and non-diabetic chronic wound infections. Using these data, we show that wounds are nutrient-rich growth environments in which long-chain fatty acids are a primary source of carbon and energy. We also show that the ability to travel along spatio-chemical gradients by chemotaxis is critical for bacterial fitness and virulence in acute but not chronic infections. Our results demonstrate the utility of simultaneous mutant fitness and gene expression profiling to discover critical functions in complex growth environments."

Although much has been learned about the main aspects of the so-called foraging problem, some important questions still remain unanswered. In this work we address the issue of the relevance of heterogeneity in the resources distribution to efficient animal foraging behavior. Our results unveil the key mechanism coupling landscape heterogeneity dynamics with optimal search diffusivity. Indeed, although the effect of (global) resource density on animal foraging behavior is well documented, much less has been known about how spatiotemporal landscape heterogeneity affects the efficiency of encounter interactions by foraging organisms. In this sense, we propose a new empirically testable theoretical prediction on the dynamics (e.g. diffusion exponent) of foraging organisms in heterogeneous environments. We also show that the conditions in which Lévy strategies are optimal are much broader than previously considered."

For each cell, the decision to do so is critically dependent on the interplay between environmental cues and the internal state of the cell and is influenced by random fluctuations in cellular processes. Indeed, experimental evidence indicates that cell cycle entry is highly variable from cell to cell, even within a clonal population. To account for such variability, a number of phenomenological models have been previously proposed. These models primarily fall into two types depending on their fundamental assumptions on the origin of the variability. “Transition probability” models presume that variability in cell cycle entry originates from the fact that entry in each individual cell is random but also governed by a fixed probability. In contrast, “growth-controlled” models assume that the growth rates across a population are variable and result in cells that are out of phase developmentally. While both kinds of models provide a good fit to experimental data, their lack of mechanistic details limits their predictive power and has led to unresolved debate between their practitioners. In this study, we developed a mechanistically based stochastic model of the temporal dynamics of activation of the E2F transcription factor, which is used here as a marker of the transition of cells from quiescence to active cell cycling. Using this model, we show that “transition probability” and “growth-controlled” models can be reconciled by incorporation of a small number of basic cellular parameters related to protein synthesis and turnover, protein modification, stochasticity, and the like. Essentially our work shows that each kind of phenomenological model holds true for describing a particular aspect of the cell cycle transition. We suggest that incorporation of basic cellular parameters in this manner into phenomenological models may constitute a broadly applicable approach to defining concise, quantitative phenotypes of cell physiology."

Typically they recognize a binding site in genes' sequences and exert a repressive effect. This scheme prescribes a regulatory network that determines which gene is regulated by which miRNA. Yet this is a static sequence-based scheme that might not support dynamic changes in network wiring. Can genes become subject to, or be released, from the regulation of a miRNA in a manner that depends on the physiological state of cells? Here we describe such a dynamic mechanism. It is established that miRNA regulation is often more effective when their binding sites reside near the end of the target mRNA or right after the coding sequence STOP codon. Thus, a site distant from the mRNA’s end might be latent as it will not bind efficiently its corresponding miRNA. Yet, in particular physiological states, e.g. cancer or rapidly proliferating cells, mRNA ends tend to become shortened. So far it was suggested that such shortening may serve to release proliferation-favoring genes from miRNA repression by eliminating their binding sites from the mRNA. We propose a mirror image, complementary mechanism that acts upon genes that need to be repressed during proliferation. Specifically, we propose that mRNA shortening can dynamically activate latent repressive miRNA binding sites by bringing the mRNA end close to them. We mapped the ends of all mRNAs in proliferating cells and found that cancer-enriched ends are strikingly positioned closely downstream to a high density of potentially latent binding sites, which are retained in the short mRNA but are now close to the new ends. This may enable such potentially latent miRNA sites to become dynamically activated upon proliferation. Remarkably, this mechanism targets preferentially pro-differentiation and antiproliferative genes, which are often repressed in cancer."

When subjected to various stresses, eukaryotic cells modulate general and gene-specific protein synthesis by phosphorylating the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single eIF2α kinase, Gcn2, activated by uncharged tRNAs that accumulate in amino acid starved cells, which bind to a regulatory domain homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS). Gcn2 also contains a C-terminal domain implicated in autoinhibition of Gcn2. Our findings identify a direct interaction between the CTD and a novel regulatory surface in the HisRS domain that is required for inhibition of Gcn2 function in non-starved cells, which is down-regulated by uncharged tRNA. The results further suggest that tRNA binding to the pseudo-active site in the HisRS domain remodels its proximal CTD-binding surface to weaken HisRS/CTD interaction and thereby release the autoinhibitory function of the CTD to activate kinase function. This study provides new molecular insights into how tRNA binding can modulate regulatory interactions among the HisRS, CTD, and kinase domains of Gcn2 to elicit kinase activation."

They were partly successful, with Brazil being the largest country to be declared free of Ae. aegypti. Within ten years of relaxation of control efforts, Ae. aegypti reappeared in Brazil and today is the vector of the most intense dengue epidemics in the New World. Here, we present population genetic data that are most consistent with the species having truly been eradicated from Brazil rather than simply pushed into small refugia as a consequence of the eradication campaign. The re-infestation most likely resulted from two sources: 1) from northern S. American countries like Venezuela into northwest Brazil and 2) from the Caribbean into the southeast of the country."

Tumor cells typically up-regulate telomerase to maintain telomeres during rapid growth; however, some tumors lack telomerase and utilize alternative mechanisms to maintain the telomeres. Studies in yeast indicate that recombination contributes to telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase. To examine whether recombination contributes to non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance in mouse and human cells, we utilized mouse primary and tumor cells, which were genetically deleted for telomerase. In addition, we assayed human primary cells that had short telomeres due to reduced telomerase activity. Our data indicate that cells with short telomeres have an increased level of telomere recombination, which can occur in telomeric or subtelomeric regions. We also found that, in addition to tumor cells, primary cells can utilize non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance. Lastly, we found that, unlike human telomerase negative tumors, some mechanisms of telomere maintenance do not result in dramatic telomere lengthening. Thus, mammalian cells likely utilize several different non-telomerase mechanisms for telomere maintenance. These findings will be useful for understanding the process of telomere lengthening in various types of human tumors."

However, such structures are often temporally extended and latent or hidden, being only partially correlated with immediate observations of the world. This makes it essential to integrate current and historical information, and creates a challenging statistical and computational problem. Here, we examine the behaviour of rats facing a version of this challenge posed by a brain-stimulation reward task. We find that subjects learned the general structure of the task, but struggled when immediate observations were misleading. We captured this behaviour with a model in which subjects integrated evidence from recent observations together with evidence from the past. The subjects’ performance improved markedly over successive sessions, allowing them to overcome misleading observations. According to our model, this was made possible by more effective usage of past evidence to better determine the true state of the world."

The circadian clock is constructed as a negative feedback loop, in which clock proteins inhibit their own synthesis. During the last decade, a picture has emerged in which each cell is a self-sustained circadian oscillator that runs even without synchronizing cues. Here, we investigated state-of-the-art single-cell bioluminescence recordings of clock gene expression. It turns out that these time series are very well described by low-dimensional models, enabling us to extract descriptive parameters that characterize each cell. We find that different cell types do not differ much in their dynamics. However, different mutations in core clock genes yield different dynamic characteristics. Furthermore, we could not statistically reject the idea that the cells are in fact damped oscillators driven by noise. We thus declare the question of whether the circadian clock is a damped or self-sustained oscillator still unresolved. Further, we propose a way to resolve this question by examining the frequency-dependent response of single cells to periodic stimuli. We will then be in a better position to understand how cells coordinate and synchronize their circadian rhythms."

Here we develop, and apply, a DNA ‘toolkit’ to five years of samples collected from a single site in the Indian ocean. It is rare to find a temporal series of samples of this duration that are also suitable for DNA analysis. We show that eDNA techniques have the capacity to monitor ocean biology in fine detail. We demonstrate how the biological communities of plankton and fish respond to normal seasonal changes and, more importantly, to that of an uncharacteristic heatwave. The methods embodied in this paper are applicable to marine studies across the globe and, as such, pave the way for the design of long-term monitoring programs using eDNA."

One hypothesis for the origin of sex chromosomes is that a portion of the sex chromosome was derived from B chromosomes. In about 10% of eukaryotes, B chromosomes are found in addition to standard chromosomes (sex chromosomes and autosomes). B chromosomes have been thought to be selfish genetic elements with no functional effect on the phenotype of individuals and have been thought to lack protein-coding genes. Although B chromosomes share unique features with sex chromosomes, concrete evidence describing which B chromosomes have evolved to gain a function in sex determination has not been reported. In this study, we found that B chromosomes in one cichlid species from Lake Victoria have a functional effect on sex determination. Moreover, we found that they contained multiple protein-coding genes including morphogenetic related genes. These findings support the hypothesis that a portion of the sex chromosomes has been derived from B chromosomes and shed light on the study of the evolution of sex chromosomes."

Circadian clocks are responsible for daily circadian rhythms in molecular, physiological, and behavioral processes. Their mechanism relies on transcriptional activators and repressors that constitute a feedback loop. The CLOCK (CLK) activator is required to initiate the transcription of the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes in the late day. The PER and TIM repressors accumulate in a delayed manner and translocate to the nucleus to repress their own gene. Degradation of these repressors allows the activator to start a new cycle. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the PER and TIM repressors targets them for degradation. Here we find that the CLK activator is also regulated by CK2. In contrast to PER and TIM, CLK is stabilized by CK2α phosphorylation; we also show that PER and TIM are dispensable for this stabilization of CLK. The identification of CK2–CLK protein complexes and the in vitro phosphorylation of CLK by CK2 hint at a direct action of the kinase on the activator. Although transcription factor stabilization is generally expected to be associated with increased activity, genetic analysis indicates that CK2 represses CLK. Hence CK2 phosphorylation seems to be a key signal for the transcriptional activator complex to adopt a proper activation state at a given point of the circadian cycle."

Mutations in dystrophin can lead to a severe muscle wasting disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys. DMD patients are typically wheelchair bound by 9–13 years of age and die at approximately 30 years. There are also mutations within the dystrophin gene that lead to internal truncations of non-essential regions, such as the internal rod domain that leads to a mild form of the disease called Becker Muscular Dystrophy. However, these internal truncations frequently occur at a “hot spot” within the rod domain where the resulting disease severity is difficult to predict. Here we found that consecutive proline residues, that function much like a molecular ruler, can dramatically influence the function of these internally truncated dystrophins within skeletal muscles. Using this information, we designed a dystrophin mini-gene that can accommodate the limited packaging size of recombinant adeno-associated virus. This virus can deliver the dystrophin mini-gene to most muscles throughout a dystrophic mouse to prevent muscle degeneration and partially restore muscle function."

An infection with intermediate virulence will produce more transmissions during the infectious lifetime because it optimises the trade-off between rate of transmission and duration of infection. Natural selection acts on the heritable variation to increase the relative prevalence of strains with intermediate virulence. In this study we model the evolution of virulence in the viral population as these more successful strains are preferentially transmitted. We fit this model to data from transmitting couples, and find that the model fits the data well. We use this fit to estimate the contribution of the host and the virus to virulence, which complements recent estimates of the heritability of virulence. We also estimate the rate at which the viral determinants of virulence evolve between infections, and this provides predictions for how rapidly the virulence of HIV-1 evolves in a population. We suggest that natural selection on transmissibility results in substantial evolution of virulence in the population. This is sufficiently rapid for virulence to have reached current levels over the available timescale of the human epidemic."

With so many people regularly receiving treatment, there is a risk that drug resistance may develop. As a result, the number of studies looking for genetic markers of drug resistance has increased noticeably. In this paper we analyse the results of one such study that investigated the presence of genes associated with drug resistance in parasites responsible for elephantiasis. This study, like many other studies of human parasitic infections, relies on analysing parasite immature stages (such as eggs) because the adult worms are often inaccessible within the human body. Using computer models we show how the gene frequency in the immature stages may vary from that in the adult worm population. Parasites with these markers for drug resistance might also be unevenly distributed across the host population even prior to treatment. This may increase the spread of drug resistance and make it harder to detect. We suggest that studies conducted only on parasite immature stages should be interpreted with caution and should carefully consider the number of people and the number of parasites they analyse."

Recent data suggest that separase, together with polo-like kinase Plk1, is essential for the centriole disengagement and individual depletion of either separase or Plk1 alone fails to suppress the centriole disengagement. This raises the question of how separase activity is regulated at the centrosome. By generating a series of separase sensors, we show that separase at centrosomes becomes active already in mid metaphase, well before its activity can be detected at the chromosomes. Depletion of the previously published inhibitors of centrosomal separase, astrin or Aki1, did not promote separase activity at the centrosomes. This indicates that morphological criteria like the formation of multipolar spindles are insufficient criteria upon which to base predictions about separase regulation. Finally, the ability of Plk1 to promote cleavage of the Scc1-based reporter but not of the kendrin reporter reveals regulation of separase activity at the substrate level. These results provide partial explanation of the role of Plk1 in centriole disengagement."

They have been found to be ubiquitously expressed in embryonic and adult tissues and to interfere with TGF-ß/BMP signaling. More recently, a group of proteins has been discovered which belongs to the same protein family, the functional Smad suppressing elements (Fussel). They have a highly restricted, mainly neuronal expression pattern suggesting different functional importance compared to Ski/Sno. We have used Drosophila as a model organism to characterize the highly specific neuronal expression pattern and created knock-out mutations within the Drosophila fuss gene. Surprisingly, fuss mutants are fully viable, but they show defects in bitter taste perception, and indeed, we could prove that Fuss is expressed specifically in bitter sensing neurons, where it affects their terminal differentiation making these cells insensitive for bitter compounds. To understand the molecular process involved in Fuss function we started protein interaction studies and could show, that Fuss forms part of a chromatin modifying complex, which seems to be important for the proper differentiation of neurons in the adult nervous system, therefore, assigning Drosophila as an indispensable model to study the molecular function of the Fuss protein family."

For all of these bacteria, SRRPs have been demonstrated to play pivotal roles in adhesion to tissues and the development of invasive disease. It is now known that biofilm formation is an important step for bacterial pathogenesis. Bacteria in biofilms have been shown to have differences in metabolism, gene expression, and protein production that contribute to enhanced surface adhesion and the persistence of an infection. Herein we describe a novel role for PsrP, the S. pneumoniae SRRP, as an intra-species bacterial adhesin that promotes bacterial aggregation in the lungs of infected mice during pneumonia. In vitro we show that the Basic Region domain of PsrP promotes self-interactions that result in denser biofilms, greater biofilm biomass, and altered architectures of surface grown cultures; these interactions could be neutralized by antibodies to PsrP that are protective against pneumococcal infection. We also demonstrate that the SRRPs of S. aureus and Streptococcus gordonii also function as intra-species bacterial adhesins. Therefore we conclude that SRRPs have dual roles as host-cell and intra-species bacterial adhesins."

Nearly every species of animal requires it, yet we do not know why. One idea, known as the synaptic renormalization hypothesis, suggests that waking results in a global increase in the strengths of connections in the brain, a phenomenon which is unsustainable because stronger connections consume more energy and take up more space. The function of sleep, according to this hypothesis, is to downscale or “renormalize” connection strengths. While mounting experimental evidence confirms that sleep-dependent synaptic downscaling does occur, we still do not know what biophysical mechanism causes it. In this paper, we show computational results which indicate that the neuromodulator acetylcholine may have a key role to play in sleep-dependent synaptic downscaling. If confirmed experimentally, these findings will help to unravel the mystery of sleep."

Multi-drug resistant bacteria e.g. MRSA are present in nearly all hospitals, and community acquired TB is often recalcitrant to treatment. Less well known, but causing four to five times more deaths in the UK than MRSA, are fungi in the genus Candida. These are commonly associated with mucosal infections such as “thrush”, but are responsible for > 400,000 life-threatening infections worldwide every year, especially in the immunosuppressed patient population. One of the principle pathogens is Candida glabrata. This fungus grows as a single celled yeast, and alarmingly is highly resistant to both host innate defences and many clinically used antifungal drugs. Even with the best possible medical care, infections with this yeast cause ~50% mortality and alarmingly the incidence of C. glabrata infections is steadily climbing. This demands that novel antifungal therapies are developed that can target drug resistant fungal infections such as C. glabrata. We have identified genes that prevent the growth of fungal cells that express gain-of-function mutations in Pdr1, a key mediator of antifungal resistance in C. glabrata. We also provide proof of concept that targeting a protein essential for Pdr1 function significantly inhibits the emergence of antifungal drug resistance. Thus such an approach could provide a powerful tool in developing treatments for drug resistant infections."

Identification of genetic variants of consequence for HTN serves as the molecular basis for its treatment. Using admixture mapping analysis of the Family Blood Pressure Program data, we recently identified that the VNN1 gene (encoding the protein vanin-1), in particular SNP rs2272996 (N131S), was associated with BP in both African Americans and Mexican Americans. Vanin-1 was reported to act as an oxidative stress sensor using its pantetheinase enzyme activity. Because a linkage between oxidative stress and HTN has been hypothesized for many years, vanin-1's pantetheinase activity offers a physiologic rationale for BP regulation. Here, we first replicated the association of rs2272996 with BP in the Continental Origins and Genetic Epidemiology Network (COGENT), which included nearly 30,000 African Americans. We further demonstrated that the N131S mutation in vanin-1 leads to its rapid degradation in cells, resulting in loss of function on the plasma membrane. The loss of function of vanin-1 is associated with reduced BP. Therefore, our results indicate that vanin-1 is a new candidate to be manipulated to ameliorate HTN."

G-protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases including inflammation, cardiac dysfunction, and diabetes, and are the targets of 40–50% of modern drugs. Despite the physiological and pharmacological importance of this signal transduction system it is not known how the system buffers and integrates information at a biochemical level. The multiple receptors expressed by every cell pass their signals through a common set of downstream effectors distinguished by multiple isoforms with slightly different specificities and activities. The coupling among these pathways causes interactions among the signals sent by the different classes of receptors. We have developed a mechanistic model of the G protein signal transduction system from the receptor to the central intracellular second-messenger calcium. We have used statistical methods to integrate a diverse set of experimental data into our model and quantify confidence in our model predictions. We used this model, trained on single receptor data, to predict the signal processing of two G-protein-coupled-receptor signals. Validation experiments support our hypothesized mechanism for dual receptor signal processing and the predictions of the model."

The model accounts for this ability relying solely on the temporal coherence principle, the notion that perceived sources emit coherently modulated features that evoke coincident cortical response patterns. It further demonstrates how basic cortical mechanisms common to all sensory systems can implement the necessary representations, as well as the adaptive computations necessary to maintain continuity by tracking slowly changing characteristics of different sources in a scene."

To successfully infect their hosts, plant viruses encode silencing suppressors (VSRs) as counter-defense measures. These VSRs function to disable host antiviral RNA silencing defenses through various mechanisms that are not well understood. Here we report that a host calmodulin-like protein called Nbrgs-CaM, which appears to be an endogenous suppressor of RNA silencing, plays essential roles in suppression of RNA silencing and induction of symptoms by the VSR βC1, the sole protein encoded by a geminivirus-associated DNA satellite. The Nbrgs-CaM was up-regulated by Tomato yellow leaf curl China geminivirus (TYLCCNV)-encoded VSR βC1 upon virus infection or stable expression via a transgene. Further analyses revealed that up-regulation of Nbrgs-CaM by βC1 suppressed RNA silencing likely through repressing the expression of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6). We have demonstrated that RDR6-mediated RNA silencing plays an important role in antiviral defense in Nicotiana benthamiana and confers host range restriction against TYLCCNV infection on Arabidopsis thaliana. Our study suggests that exploiting a cellular suppressor can be an efficient mechanism for viruses to counteract host RNA silencing defense response."

Cys-loop receptors are a class of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that are activated by specific neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT), glycine (Gly), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Each type of cys-loop receptor contains an extracellular domain that specifically recognizes only one of these four neurotransmitters and opens an ion-conducting channel pore upon ligand binding. In this study, we investigated the poor specificity with which two potent neurotoxic inhibitors, namely strychnine and d-tubocurarine, are recognized by different cys-loop receptors. Using X-ray crystallography we solved 3-dimensional structures of strychnine or d-tubocurarine in complex with ACh binding protein (AChBP), a well-recognized structural homolog of the nicotinic ACh receptor. Based on ligand-receptor interactions observed in AChBP structures we designed mutant GlyR and α7 nAChR to identify hot spots in the binding pocket of these receptors that define potent inhibition by strychnine and d-tubocurarine, respectively. Combined, our results offer detailed understanding of the molecular recognition of antagonists that have high affinity but poor specificity for different cys-loop receptors."

We have identified a recessive mutation in the mouse, rudolph, that causes abnormal forebrain development and have determined that the mutated gene encodes hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 7 gene, an enzyme necessary for cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol is essential for proper signal transduction of the hedgehog family of proteins, key regulators of both developmental biology and tumor progression. We show that hedgehog signaling is diminished in our rudolph mutant. Our conclusions from studying this mouse mutant support two recent hypotheses in developmental biology. First, several human malformation syndromes are known to be caused by defects in cholesterol metabolism, but support linking the malformation to abnormal hedgehog signaling has not definitively been made. Second, while in vitro studies have shown that proper levels of metabolic by-products of cholesterol are necessary for proper hedgehog signaling, our studies offer the strongest genetic animal model evidence to support this idea."

While much research has been focused on understanding transforming functions of MCPyV gene products, owing to the lack of fully permissive replication systems, the natural lifecycle of the virus is poorly understood. Using high-throughput analyses, here we have interrogated a semi-permissive replication system to study the viral transcription program and elucidate the functions of the viral microRNA (miRNA) mcv-miR-M1. We find that, similar to other polyomavirus miRNAs, mcv-miR-M1 has the ability to negatively regulate expression of viral gene products required for viral DNA replication. Unexpectedly, however, we also observe that mcv-miR-M1 augments long-term episomal persistence of MCPyV genomes.

Both scenarios necessarily involve chloride flux into the cell and, thus, a change in intracellular chloride concentration. The vast majority of models neglect changes in ion concentration despite experimental evidence that such changes occur and are not inconsequential. The importance of considering chloride homeostasis mechanisms is heightened by evidence that several neurological diseases are associated with deficient chloride extrusion capacity. Steady state chloride levels are altered in those disease states. Fast chloride dynamics are also likely affected, but those changes have yet to be explored. To this end, we built an electrodiffusion model that tracks changes in the concentration of chloride plus multiple other ion species.

While a great deal of functional genomic data exists, providing information about these genes and their roles, the rate at which these data are leveraged into concrete biological knowledge lags far behind the rate of data generation. Many computational approaches have been developed to generate accurate predictions of gene functions, with the goal of bridging this divide. However, as no large-scale experimental efforts have been based on such approaches, their validity and utility remains unproven. We have performed a study that experimentally evaluates predictions from a combination of three computational function prediction approaches, focusing on mitochondrion-related processes in brewer's yeast as a model system. By using computational predictions to guide our laboratory investigation, we have greatly accelerated the rate at which proteins can be assigned to biological processes. Further, our results demonstrate that in order to achieve the best results, it is important for computational biologists to consider both the underlying data and the algorithmic foundations of the methods used to predict function. Lastly, we demonstrate that iterating through phases of prediction and validation has quickly and extensively expanded our knowledge of mitochondrial biology."

Despite great progress in our understanding of human history, we still know relatively little about the selection pressures and historical factors that have been important over the past 100,000 years. In that time human populations have spread around the world and adapted in a wide variety of ways to the new environments they have encountered. Here, we investigate the genomic signal of these adaptations using a large set of geographically diverse human populations typed at thousands of genetic markers across the genome. We find that patterns at selected loci are predictable from the patterns found at all markers genome-wide. On the basis of this, we argue that selection has been strongly constrained by the historical relationships and gene flow between populations."

The tissue specific paracellular barrier properties are determined by the protein composition of tight junctions that regulates the permeability of solutes and water between different compartments of the body. We show, for the first time, that a mutation in claudin-10b, forming paracellular cation channels in different tissues, causes perturbed Na+ selectivity through altered tight junction formation and function as well as increased degradation of the protein. The mutation is associated with the inability to sweat (anhidrosis) and heat intolerance as well as abnormal cation reabsorption, hypermagnesemia and kidney damage. Our combined findings show that the claudin-10b-mediated paracellular Na+ transport is required for normal sweat production and for the regulation of cation homeostasis in the kidneys."

Following fertilization between male and female gametes in the blood meal, zygotes develop into motile ookinetes that, 24 hours later, cross the mosquito midgut epithelium and encyst on the midgut wall. During this development, parasite numbers fall dramatically and as such, this may be an ideal point at which to disrupt transmission, but first essential parasite targets need to be identified. A protein family implicated in the interactions between parasites and mosquitoes is the LCCL/lectin adhesive-like protein (LAP) family. LAPs are highly expressed in the sexual and ookinete stages, yet when we removed genes encoding each of four LAPs from the genome of a rodent model malaria parasite, a developmental defect was only observed in the oocyst some ten days after the protein was first expressed. These “knockout” parasites did not undergo normal replication and consequently could not be transmitted to mice. Through genetic crosses with parasite mutants producing exclusively either female or male gametes, we demonstrate that parasites can only complete their development successfully if a wild-type lap gene is inherited through the female cell. These data throw new light on the regulation of parasite development in the mosquito, suggesting that initial development is maternally controlled, and that the LAPs may be candidates for intervention."

Impaired excitation/inhibition balance is often associated with several neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, autism and schizophrenia. However, estimating functional inhibitory connections is not an easy task and few methods are available to identify such connections from electrophysiological data. Here we present a cross-correlation based method to identify both excitatory and inhibitory functional connections in large-scale neuronal networks. The method is applicable to both in vitro and in vivo spike data recordings. Once a connectivity map (i.e. a graph) is obtained, we characterized the associated topology by means of classical graph theory metrics to unveil functional architecture. In this work, we analyze in vitro cortical networks probed by means of large-scale microelectrode arrays (i.e., 4096 sensors) and we derive network topologies from spike data. The functional organization found is called “small-world and scale-free” and is the same organization found in cortical in vivo brain regions by means of different experimental methods. We also show that to obtain reliable information about network architecture at least a network with a hundred of nodes-neurons is needed."

However, in the same cells there are switch-off enzymes known as phosphatases which function to turn off the kinases once they have done their work. A lot of studies have focussed on the role of kinases but not phosphatases in response to infection; we therefore generated a novel mouse in which the gene for one of these phosphatases, called MKP-2, has been deleted. We found that in the absence of this phosphatase unexpected things happened. The profile of inflammatory proteins, produced by a special cell of the immune system, called a macrophage, that functions to regulate infection by Leishmania, changed in ways which meant the macrophage could either fight infection very effectively or very weakly. In actual fact, we found that the macrophages with no MKP-2 fought off Leishmania poorly and mice deficient in MKP-2 had a modified immune response favouring the growth of the parasite. This is the first study to give critical insight into the role of MKP-2 in fighting Leishmania infection and demonstrates very well the importance of this class of enzyme in pathogen biology."

NF-κB inhibition by poxviruses is a growing area of interest and this family of viruses has developed multiple mechanisms to manipulate the pathway. Here, we focus on regulation of the NF-κB pathway by ectromelia virus, the causative agent of mousepox. We demonstrate that ectromelia virus is a potent inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway. Previously, we identified a family of four ectromelia virus genes that contain N-terminal ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal F-box domain that interacts with the cellular SCF ubiquitin ligase. Significantly, expression of the ankyrin/F-box protein, EVM005, inhibited NF-κB, and the F-box domain was critical for NF-κB inhibition and interaction with the SCF complex. Ectromelia virus devoid of EVM005 still inhibited NF-κB, indicating that multiple gene products contribute to NF-κB inhibition. Importantly, mice infected with ectromelia virus lacking EVM005 had a robust immune response, leading to viral clearance during infection. The data present two mechanisms, one in which EVM005 inhibits NF-κB activation through manipulation of the host SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, and an additional, NF-κB-independent mechanism that drives virulence."

Here we show that bacterial cyclic β-glucans can be used to enhance cellular immunity by activation of dendritic cells, from both mice and humans. In particular, Cyclic-β glucans enhance the in vitro memory CD4+ T cell responses of patients suffering from hepatitis C and tuberculosis. Thus cyclic-β glucans are new adjuvants, which might be used in vaccines."

A particular variant (Zp-V3) of the viral promoter driving expression of the EBV immediate-early BZLF1 (Z) protein that mediates lytic viral reactivation has been reported to be over-represented (relative to the prototype Zp-P form of the promoter) in certain EBV-positive malignancies, but no functional difference between the two promoter variants has been reported. Here we show that the malignancy-associated Zp-V3 variant (but not the Zp-P variant) contains a binding site for the cellular NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells c1) transcription factor that allows it to be activated by NFATc1-inducing stimuli such as B-cell receptor stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoring this NFATc1-motif to the Zp-P variant in the context of the intact EBV genome greatly enhances lytic viral reactivation in response to the NFATc1-inducing stimuli. We also find that the Zp-V3 variant is over-represented in EBV-positive Burkitt lymphomas and gastric carcinomas, and in lymphoblastoid cell lines transformed by EBV-infected breast milk of Kenyan mothers that had malaria during pregnancy. These findings suggest that the Zp-V3 version of the EBV BZLF1 promoter increases the likelihood of EBV-induced malignancies by increasing lytic EBV infection."

Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes mature over about 10 days, during which time they undergo a remarkable morphological transformation, eventually adopting a characteristic crescent shape. The shape changes are thought to facilitate the mechanical sequestration of maturing gametocytes within the bone marrow and spleen, as well as the eventual release into the circulation. Failure to mature correctly leads to a failure to transmit. Despite the importance of this process, little is known about the molecular basis of elongation. In this work, we introduce 3D Electron Microscopy of P. falciparum gametocytes and use it, in a combination with super-resolution optical microscopy, to elucidate the genesis and expansion of the molecular structures that drive gametocyte elongation. We use protein interaction profiling to identify some of the proteins that help drive the shape change and employ inducible gene knockdown strategies to show that these proteins play a role in remodeling membranes, and are needed for gametocyte elongation. This work points to potential targets for the development of transmission-blocking therapies."

Our body produces its own survival factors for neurons, so-called neurotrophic factors, which have additional roles in neuron differentiation, growth, and function. Declining production of a neurotrophic factor or impaired signal transduction in ageing neurons may contribute to pathological neurodegeneration in humans. Glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been suggested as survival factors for midbrain dopaminergic neurons, a group of neurons primarily affected in Parkinson disease.To investigate the physiological requirements for GDNF and BDNF to establish and maintain an important output pathway of these neurons—the nigrostriatal pathway—in the intact brain, we generated mutant mice with regionally selective ablations of the receptors for these survival factors, Ret (receptor of GDNF and related family members) or TrkB (BDNF receptor). Surprisingly, these mice survive to adulthood and show normal development and maturation of the nigrostriatal system. However, in ageing mice, ablation of Ret leads to a progressive and cell-type–specific loss of substantia nigra pars compacta neurons and their projections into the striatum. Our findings establish Ret and subsequent downstream effectors as critical regulators of long-term maintenance of the nigrostriatal system."

In the case of malaria, our most advanced vaccine candidates aim to promote the production of antibodies that recognize the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) molecule on the surface of the invasive parasite stage called the sporozoite. In this report we use X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of CSP-binding antibodies at the atomic level. We use other techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry and structural modeling to examine how this antibody interacts with the CSP molecule. Strikingly, we found that each CSP molecule could bind 6 antibodies. This finding has implications for the immune response and may explain why high titers of antibody are needed for protection. Moreover, because the structure of the CSP repeat is quite simple we determined that the number of different kinds of antibodies that could bind this molecule are quite small. However a high avidity interaction between those antibodies and CSP can result from a process called affinity maturation that allows the body to learn how to make improved antibodies specific for pathogen molecules. These data show that while it is challenging for the immune system to recognize and neutralize CSP, it should be possible to generate viable vaccines targeting this molecule."

Colorectal cancer is thought to develop through a series of early and later stages (called cancer initiation and progression, respectively). Deaths from colorectal cancer are particularly tragic because the disease can usually be cured if discovered before full-blown progression. However, our knowledge of how these tumors progress remains very limited. DNA mismatch repair is known to be an important process in preventing ∼15% of colorectal cancer initiation. In this study we describe how two of these genes (Mlh3 and Pms2) that have partial functional redundancy and therefore individually are rarely mutated are also important in preventing colorectal cancer progression. Additionally, we describe a new gene (Tle6-like) that, when overactive, makes these cancers progress more rapidly. The overall goal of this study is to understand colorectal cancer progression better so that we can come up with new ways to block it at the later stage."

However, classical mathematical models of host-parasite coevolution account neither for the hosts' use of bacterial symbionts for protection from parasites, nor for the potential and observed complexity of genetic interactions between the coevolving species. In this article we address both challenges by simulating a large number of models of host-symbiont-parasite coevolution based on randomly generated genotype interaction patterns. We demonstrate that the degree of “specificity” between the genotypes of the interacting species is a major factor influencing the outcome of coevolution. We also observe that the symbionts may take over from the hosts the coevolutionary arms race against the parasites. Overall, our results make clear that the complex interaction patterns and the defensive symbionts can both play vital roles in host-parasite coevolution. An additional contribution of the article is a numerical index of specificity, applicable to a wide range of existing and future coevolutionary models."

While CD4+/CD8+ T cells are protective, role of γδ T cells in TB and other infections remains unknown in humans. Vγ2Vδ2 T cells exist only in primates, represent a dominant circulating γδ T-cell subpopulation, and recognize phosphoantigen from Mtb and some selected pathogens. Here, we determined whether earlier expansion/differentiation of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells during Mtb infection increased resistance to TB in macaques. Phosphoantigen plus IL-2 administration induced expansion and pulmonary accumulation of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells, significantly reduced Mtb counts and attenuated TB lesions in lung tissues. Expanded Vγ2Vδ2 T cells produced anti-TB cytokines IFNγ, perforin and granulysin, and co-produced perforin and granulysin in lung tissue. Perforin/granulysin-co-producing Vγ2Vδ2 T cells limited intracellular Mtb growth, and macaque granulysin killed Mtb bacteria, and inhibited intracellular Mtb in presence of perforin. Furthermore, expansion of Vγ2Vδ2 T effectors enhanced pulmonary responses of peptide-specific CD4+/CD8+ T cells, which correlated with the ability of Vγ2Vδ2 T effector cells to produce IL-12. These results provide first evidence implicating a protective role of Vγ2Vδ2 T effector cells in TB, supporting a rationale to explore Vγ2Vδ2 T-cell-targeted treatment of drug-resistant TB or HIV-related TB."

It has recently been suggested that antiretroviral therapies fail during cell-to-cell transmission because of the high number of particles transferred at sites of cell-cell contacts. However, these findings stand in contrast with the clinical observation that ART is successful in suppressing retroviral replication in HIV-positive patients. Consequently, many interpreted this observation to suggest that HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is not clinically relevant. Here we show that this interpretation is likely incorrect. By systematically testing the efficacy of commonly used antiretroviral inhibitors against cell-to-cell and cell-free HIV-1 transmission, we demonstrate that, while some NRTIs are less effective, most NNRTIs, entry inhibitors and protease inhibitors remain highly effective. Moreover, NRTIs become highly effective when combined, thus supporting the known effectiveness of HAART in clinical settings. Interestingly, the ability of individual drugs and combinations to interfere with HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission correlates with their effectiveness against high viral MOIs. Our results suggest that the ability to suppress the high viral MOI during HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is a critical feature of existing ART regimens that should be tested when designing novel antiviral therapies."

Our findings shed new light into how HIV-1 evades detection from B cells that can produce bNAbs and also provides information that is relevant for the design of optimal immunization strategies."

The advances in Epigenetics in past decades has revealed it as a fundamental mechanism that could inheritably influence gene function without change in DNA sequence, but by modulating chemical modifications on DNA itself (methylation), or on histone proteins, which package the DNA further into nucleosome. Nevertheless, the roles of epigenetic regulation in natural variation were not explored much because of the limitation in high-throughput analytical tools. A recent study in model plant Arabidopsis showed that there are many DNA methylation polymorphisms between the two ecotypes. In plant, a subset of RNA named small interfering RNA (siRNA), is capable of triggering the epigenetic modifications on DNA or histone at their target region with complementary nucleotide sequences. Here, we took a view from the small RNA side and by applying molecular and bioinformatic approaches we showed that the same region could be led to a different epigenetic status because of the difference in their corresponding small RNA abundance and between the two closely related Arabidopsis ecotypes, suggesting that there could be small RNA-directed epigenetic differences among natural populations."

Unraveling these resistance mechanisms are of great importance for delaying insect field resistance evolution. The diamondback moth was the first insect to evolve field resistance to Bt biopesticides and it is an excellent model for the study of Bt resistance mechanisms. In this work, we present strong empirical evidence supporting that (1) field-evolved resistance to Bt in P. xylostella is tightly associated with differential expression of a membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and a suite of ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C (ABCC) genes, and (2) a constitutively transcriptionally-activated upstream gene (MAP4K4) in the MAPK signaling pathway is responsible for this trans-regulatory signaling mechanism. These findings identify key resistance genes and provide the first comprehensive mechanistic description responsible for the field-evolved Bt resistance in P. xylostella. Given that expression alterations of multiple receptor genes result in Bt resistance in many other insects, it can now be tested to determine whether the previously unidentified trans-regulatory mechanism characterized in this study is also involved in these cases."

The one drug widely available, praziquantel (PZQ), is not ideal. PZQ kills the adult worms but not the developing juveniles so the treated patient may not be cured long-term. In addition, use of repeated mass treatment campaigns with PZQ to control morbidity raises concerns about the development of drug resistance. Our work is aimed at providing starting points for drug discovery programs for schistosomiasis by screening large compound libraries against whole organisms. Praziquantel and several other known anti-schistosomal drugs are also active in vitro against the adult worms and the larval stages, schistosomula. The latter are ideal for novel drug screening as they can be produced in large numbers in vitro, are small and so are amenable to screening in microwell plates. Drug activity can be assessed visually but this is subjective and laborious. We have built an automated system for assessing drug action involving the collection of images of the larvae and the development of computer algorithms to analyze their morphology and motility, defining them as ""hits"" or ""nonhits."" The method is reliable, consistent and efficient, making it feasible, for the first time, to screen large compound collections."

Candidate factors that promote infection include hemolysins encoded by several leptospiral genes. Hemolysins rupture red blood cells in vitro. Some hemolysins are sphingomyelinases, which target sphingomyelin in the host cell membrane. Hemolysins have the potential to disrupt organ function during infection. It is not known which hemolysins and sphingomyelinases are responsible for the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans. We found that the production of hemolytic activity is regulated and is tied to expression of sph2, which encodes a hemolysin with sphingomyelinase, cytotoxic, and fibronectin-binding activities. Hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities and sph2 expression were higher when the osmolarity of the culture medium was raised to the level found in the mammalian host. Similarly, sph2 expression was substantially higher in an L. interrogans strain that secreted large amounts of hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities than in a strain that generated negligible amounts. Most importantly, disruption of the sph2 gene eliminated hemolysin production and yielded substantially less sphingomyelinase than the wild-type strain. Our findings indicate that sph2 is a major contributor to the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans and that the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities measured in standard L. interrogans cultures may underestimate the levels produced during infection."

However, you can also plan your actions in a more deliberative way, realizing that the friend who will join you is a vegetarian, and therefore you should not make the burgers that have become a staple in your cooking. These two strategies differ in how computationally demanding and accurate they are. While the habitual strategy is less computationally demanding (costs less effort and time), the deliberative strategy is more accurate. Scientists have been able to study the distinction between these strategies using a task that allows them to measure how much people rely on habit and planning strategies. Interestingly, we have discovered that in this task, the deliberative strategy does not increase performance accuracy, and hence does not induce a trade-off between accuracy and demand. We describe why this happens, and improve the task so that it embodies an accuracy-demand trade-off, providing evidence for theories of cost-based arbitration between cognitive strategies."

In addition, our approach can be applied to very complex models including as many as a dozen populations, and still retrieve parameters very accurately in a reasonable time. We apply our approach to estimate the past demography of four human populations for which non-coding whole genome diversity is available, estimating the degree of European admixture of a southwest African American population and that of a Kenyan population with an unsampled East African population. We also show the versatility of our framework by inferring the demographic history of African populations from SNP chip data with known ascertainment bias, and find a very old divergence time (>110 Ky) between Yorubas from Western Africa and Sans from Southern Africa."

Our study takes a systematic approach to identify the range of cargo proteins that bind to each of the known receptors in yeast.

Residual insecticide spraying has been used successfully for the elimination of domestic vectors in many regions. However, some vectors of non-domestic origin are able to invade houses, and they are now a key challenge for further disease control. We developed a mathematical model to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses, based on triatomine demographic parameters. The reliability of the predictions was demonstrated by comparing these with different sets of insect collection data from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We then simulated vector control strategies based on insecticide spraying, insect, screens and bednets to evaluate their efficacy at reducing triatomine abundance in the houses. An optimum reduction in bug abundance by at least 80% could be obtained by insecticide application only when doses of at least 50 mg/m2 were applied every year within a two-month period matching the house invasion season by bugs. Alternatively, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance in the houses and offers a sustainable alternative. Such screens may be part of novel interventions for the integrated control of various vector-borne diseases."

In addition to these three APOBEC3 family proteins, certain haplotypes of APOBEC3H have the ability to control HIV-1 replication in cell culture studies. However, the anti-viral effect of APOBEC3H polymorphism in vivo and in human population is yet to be addressed.

We found an overall viral infection rate in CI mosquitoes of 76% but infected or not, most (78%) died before or at day six post-infection; only six (12%) out of 50, survivors had virus in head and were potentially infectious at day seven post-infection. A higher infection (84%) was observed in single-virus infected mosquitoes, but they suffered only 6% mortality after 6 days and 32 (64%) survivors tested positive for virus in head after 7 days. Survival, fecundity and ovaric cycle of CI mosquitoes were reduced in 70, 52 and 40% in comparison to the ones of control. Therefore, if the fungus caused a 5-fold reduction in the number of infectious mosquitoes, it has potential to be evaluated against the Dengue transmitter in field."

There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7–11 year olds. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990–2009. We find that: 1) the best-fitting model is one in which the vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell vaccine, 2) increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge and 3) 2010–2012 disease incidence is predicted well. These results demonstrate that the resurgence in pertussis in the U.S. can be explained by past changes in vaccination policy. However, our findings suggest that the efficacy of the currently-used acellular vaccine is not much lower than that of the whole-cell vaccine, and booster doses may be sufficient to curtail epidemics while vaccine research continues."

This is an increasingly important problem as sequence database sizes continue to grow, and even today many computational analyses require that the statistics of billions of sequence comparisons be assessed automatically. Here we explore statistical significance evaluation on data that is stratified—that is, naturally partitioned into subsets that may differ in their amount of signal—and find a theoretically optimal criterion for automatically setting thresholds of significance for each stratum. For the task of domain prediction, an important component of efforts to annotate protein sequences and identify remote sequence homologs, we empirically show that our stratified analysis of statistical significance greatly improves upon a combined analysis. Further, we identify weaknesses in the prevailing random sequence model for assessing statistical significance for a small subset of domain families with repetitive sequence patterns and known biological, structural, and evolutionary properties. Our theoretical findings in statistics are relevant not only for identifying protein domains, but for arbitrary stratified problems in genomics and beyond."

A type III                    system in Yersinia translocates an effector called YopJ that                    elicits cell death in macrophages. YopJ inhibits the production of survival                    factors in naïve macrophages, causing them to die by apoptosis, which is                    generally considered to be immunologically silent. However, recent studies show                    that caspase-1, a key regulator of pro-inflammatory responses, is activated in                        Yersinia-infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis. How                    caspase-1 is activated during YopJ-induced macrophage apoptosis is not known.

The data show                    that YopJKIM has two amino acid changes that give it an enhanced                    ability to inhibit survival signals in macrophages. The increased apoptosis may                    cause membrane permeability, resulting in efflux of ions and activation of                    caspase-1. Therefore, apoptosis of naïve macrophages inflicted by highly                    virulent pathogens may not be immunologically silent."

Mitochondria are the main site of lipid oxidation which, in the heart, supplies most of the energy required for its blood pumping function. Paradoxically, however, lipids over supply impair mitochondrial function leading to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and diabetes. In this context, scientific debate centers on the impact of lipids and mitochondrial function on diverse aspects of human health, nutrition and disease. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this issue, while accounting for both the fundamental role of lipids as energy source as well as their potential detrimental effects, we utilized a combined experimental and computational approach. Our mitochondrial computational model includes β-oxidation, the main route of lipid degradation, among other pathways that include oxygen radical generation and consumption. Studies were performed in heart mitochondria from type 1 diabetic and control guinea pigs. Model and experimental results show that, below a concentration threshold, lipids fueling proceeds without disrupting mitochondrial function; above threshold, lipids uncouple mitochondrial respiration triggering excess emission of oxidants while impairing antioxidant systems and the mitochondrial energy supply-demand response. These contributions are of direct use for interpreting and predicting functional impairments in metabolic disorders associated with increased circulating levels of lipids and metabolic alterations in their utilization, storage and intracellular signaling."

We investigated the role of neutrophils in soft tissue infections, as these immune cells have been shown to be both essential for clearance of this pathogen but also for increasing tissue injury associated with S. aureus infections. We visualized the behaviour of neutrophils in the subcutaneous tissue following the introduction of a localized infectious stimulus. In addition to a profound neutrophil recruitment into the infectious nidus, significant neutrophil crawling in capillaries surrounding the region was also noted, a region of vasculature which has not previously been associated with neutrophil recruitment during infection. The neutrophils were not seen to emigrate from the capillaries but rather were retained in these vessels and maintained a crawling behaviour via β2 and α4 integrins. Blocking these integrins released the neutrophils from the capillaries, reinstituted capillary perfusion, and reduced the surrounding cell death leading to reduced lesion size following infection. Neutrophil crawling within capillaries during MRSA soft tissue infections, while potentially contributing to walling off or preventing dissemination of the pathogen, resulted in impaired perfusion and increased tissue injury."

The disease mainly occurs across tropical Africa and infection can result in blindness, debilitating itching and a variety of skin changes. Initial research concentrated mainly on the problem of blindness. A number of studies on onchocercal skin disease were performed but were difficult to interpret and compare because of the use of inconsistent terminology. Within the setting of one of the early trials of ivermectin in a savanna area of northern Nigeria, where there were known high rates of onchocercal blindness, we used a novel clinical classification of the skin changes in onchocerciasis. We identified significant levels of itching and various forms of onchocercal skin disease within these endemic communities. A positive skin-snip result proved to be a significant risk factor for the presence of chronic papular onchodermatitis (CPOD), depigmentation, hanging groin and onchocercal nodules. Comparable results were found when the presence of nodules was used as the marker for infection and similar, though weaker odds ratios were found with microfilarial load per se. The findings triggered a reassessment of the true burden of skin disease in onchocerciasis. It is the first detailed report of the association between onchocercal skin disease and markers of infection."

The remaining five genetic loci were not previously implicated in protein glycosylation, but the most of them have been reported to be relevant for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions and/or haematological cancers. A particularly interesting gene, IKZF1 was found to be associated with multiple IgG N-glycans. This gene has been implicated in numerous diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

This is because the vaccines only target a small proportion of the total pneumococcal population. Introduction of vaccine in the United States removed vaccine serotypes leaving an open niche that was rapidly filled by non-vaccine serotypes. Forecasting which serotypes, and more generally which pneumococcal lineages, will increase in frequency in carriage and disease is an active area of research with significant public health importance. Here, we investigate the evolutionary impact of vaccination on the pneumococcal population using genomic data from a collection of 937 pneumococcal isolates collected from 1998–2012 among Native American communities. We find the impact of vaccine on the pneumococcal population could be observed in reduced diversity and changing frequencies of genes. Diversity subsequently rebounded through expansion and in-migration of non-vaccine lineages. Further, frequencies of genes coding for protein antigens important to host-pathogen interaction were initially disrupted but later returned to pre-vaccine values, suggesting selection may have acted in maintaining frequencies. These data improve our understanding of pneumococcal evolution and emphasize the need to consider genome composition when inferring the impact of vaccination."

In operons, the process of transcription is physically coupled: a single pass of the RNA polymerase enzyme reading that region of the chromosome simultaneously produces messenger RNA encoding multiple proteins. So far, we do not have a satisfying explanation for what evolutionary forces have maintained operons on bacterial chromosomes. We hypothesized that different types of interactions between operon-coded proteins affect how strongly operons are selected for between two genes. The proposed mechanism for this effect is that operons correlate gene expression noise, changing how it manifests in the post-translational network depending on the type of protein interaction. Mathematical models demonstrate that operons reduce noise for some types of interactions but not others. We found that operon-dependent noise reduction has an underlying dependence on surprisingly high sensitivity of the network to the ratio of proteins from each gene. Databases of genetic information show that E. coli has operons more frequently than random if operons reduce noise for the type of interaction various gene pairs have, but not otherwise. Our study thus provides an example of how the architecture of post-translational networks affects bacterial evolution."

The micropyle is formed by a special follicle cell, the ‘micropylar cell’, which sits on the top of the developing egg during oogenesis, and forms the sperm entry canal. The underlying mechanisms of this process are unknown. We find that Taz, an effector of an important signaling pathway, the Hippo pathway, is specifically enriched in micropylar cells in zebrafish, and regulates formation of the micropyle. Loss of Taz function in females results in no micropylar cells, failure to form a micropyle on eggs, which are consequently, not fertilized. Our study identifies a new role for the Hippo/Taz pathway in cell fate specification in the ovary, and reveals a potential mechanism for forming the sperm entry port. Similar mechanisms might operate in other fish as well."

We show that protein binding partners will often form substantially more complexes when both partners can localize to surfaces, and thus localization can regulate the timing of multi-protein assembly.

We created and analysed co-author networks from publications in the SCOPUS database, with a focus on five diseases.

Furthermore, we identified institutions with prominent NTD research within Germany and strong research collaborations between German institutions and partners abroad, mostly in other high-income countries. This allowed an assessment of strong collaborations for further development, e.g., for research capacity strengthening in low-income-countries, but also for identifying missed opportunities for collaboration within the network. Through co-authorship network analysis of individual researcher networks, we identified strong performers by using classic bibliometric parameters, and we identified academic talent by social network analysis parameters on an individual level."

People with acute Lyme disease often develop swollen lymph nodes, or lymphadenopathy, but we do not know why this happens or what effect it has on the course of the disease. We show here that when mice are infected with live Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes (the bacteria that cause Lyme disease), live spirochetes collect in the lymph nodes. These lymph nodes then swell up and start producing large numbers of antibody-producing cells. Although many of these antibodies can recognize the bacteria, they apparently lack the quality to clear the infection. We hypothesize that by moving into the lymph node, usually a site in which strong immune responses are induced, Borrelia evades the immune response: it goes to the lymph nodes and tricks the immune system into making a very strong but inadequate response."

However, this dogma has recently been challenged as other factors, such as epigenetic patterning of the genome, have become better understood. Sparse but convincing experimental evidence suggests that the epigenetic background, in the form of histone modifications, acts as an additional layer of regulation determining how transcripts are processed. Here we developed a computational approach to investigate the genome-wide prevalence and the level of association between the enrichment of epigenetic marks and transcript diversity generated via alternative transcription start sites and splicing. We found that the role of epigenetic patterning in alternative transcription start-site switching is likely to be the same for all genes whereas the role of epigenetic patterns in splicing is likely gene-specific. Furthermore, we show that epigenetic data alone can be used to predict the inclusion pattern of an exon. These findings have significant implications for a better understanding of the regulation of transcript diversity in humans as well as the modifications arising during tumor development."

However, the mechanisms that govern the expression of factors that contribute to colonisation and disease are incompletely understood. In this work, we further characterise how temperature influences the production of factor H binding protein (fHbp) by the meningococcus; fHbp recruits human complement proteins to the surface of the bacterium, and is an important vaccine antigen. We show that thermoregulation of fHbp occurs gradually over a physiological range of temperatures found in the upper airway, the site of colonisation. This regulation does not require specific meningococcal transcription factors, and sequence analysis indicates that fHbp mRNA forms a secondary structure which could act as an RNA thermosensor. Additional studies demonstrate that there are two specific sequences within the coding region of fHbp mRNA are important for thermosensing and could base-pair to the ribosome binding site, thus blocking translation of this protein. As fHbp is thermoregulated, vaccines that target this antigen might not impose a high level of selective pressure on the bacterium at the mucosal surface, thereby limiting herd immunity induce by fHbp containing vaccines."

However, in spite of numerous studies of this pathway over the years, the genetic sensitivity of the pathway, combined with complexity in the nuclear response to Notch activation, has often precluded an in-depth molecular understanding of the pathway. In addition, findings in many systems point to both anti- and pro-proliferative roles of Notch signaling. Here, we use a number of novel genetic strains–mutants and misexpression transgenes–and focus on a particular role of the pathway; daughter cell proliferation in the embryonic Drosophila central nervous system. Combined with genome-wide chromatin binding assays, we are able to decode the pathway and identify both the nuclear effectors downstream Notch, as well the key cell cycle genes involved. We find that Notch activity is gated by a process of direct and indirect transcriptional output, which acts to balance the proliferation decision with high fidelity. These findings shed light on the dichotomous nature of Notch signaling with respect to proliferation control and may point to widely used aspects of the pathway."

The emergence of new virulent races of this pathogen in Africa, including the Ug99 race group, has prompted global efforts to find effective resistance genes. We report here the identification of stem rust resistance gene Sr21 that is effective against the Ug99 race group. We developed a diagnostic marker to accelerate its deployment in wheat breeding programs and demonstrated that the introduction of two Sr21 copies in transgenic wheat results in high levels of resistance. An unusual characteristic of Sr21 is its increased resistance to stem rust at high temperatures. We show here that this is associated with the ability of Sr21 to coordinate the upregulation of multiple pathogenesis related genes at high temperatures. These genes slow down the growth of the pathogen and result in the characteristic Sr21 intermediate resistance reaction at high temperatures. A better understanding of this temperature dependent resistance mechanism will be useful for controlling the rust pathogens in our changing environments."

African trypanosomes are the causative agents of human sleeping sickness and the cattle disease Nagana. The parasites are obligate extracellular pathogens that multiply in the bloodstream and body fluids of their mammalian hosts and as procyclic forms in their insect vector, the tsetse fly. Bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei in which the genes for cytosolic lipid hydroperoxide-detoxifying peroxidases have been knocked out undergo an extremely rapid membrane peroxidation and lyse within less than two hours when they are cultured without an exogenous antioxidant. Here we show that the primary site of intracellular damage is the single terminal lysosome of the parasites. Disintegration of the lysosome clearly precedes damage of the mitochondrion and parasite death. Iron, acquired by the endocytosis of iron-loaded host transferrin, induces cell lysis. Contrary to the cytosolic enzymes, the respective mitochondrial peroxidase is dispensable for both in vitro proliferation and mouse infectivity. This is the first report demonstrating that cytosolic thiol peroxidases are responsible for protecting the lysosome of a cell."

The ubiquitous transcription factor Sp3 represents a paradigm for a dual function transcription factor as it can activate and repress transcription. The repression function of Sp3 is mediated by attachment of a small protein designated SUMO to a single lysine residue. SUMOylation of Sp3 thus acts as a molecular switch that determines whether Sp3 acts as an activator or repressor. In this study, we have generated mice with a subtle mutation in the SUMO attachment site of Sp3. We found that several spermatocyte- and brain-specific genes that are silenced in non-testicular and extra-neuronal tissues of wild-type animals become aberrantly de-repressed in mice in which the SUMO attachment site of Sp3 is mutated. De-repression of these genes is accompanied with dramatic epigenetic changes including the loss of repressive histone methylation marks and, most significantly, loss of DNA methylation. Our findings suggest that SUMO modification of a transcription factor can act as a molecular beacon for the assembly of repression machineries to maintain tissue-specific transcriptional gene silencing in vivo."

While in some instances the size of a structure is directly determined by the dimensions of its individual constituents, many biological structures are dynamic, self-organising assemblies of relatively small component parts. How such assemblies are maintained within defined size limits remains poorly understood. Here, by confining cells to spread on lines, we show that animal cells reach a defined length that is independent of their volume and width. In searching for a “ruler” that might determine this axial limit to cell spreading, we identified a population of dynamic microtubule polymers that become oriented along the long axis of cells. This growing population of oriented microtubules drives extension of the spreading cell margin while, conversely, interactions with the cell margin promote microtubule depolymerisation, leading to cell shortening. Using a mathematical model we show that this coupling of dynamic microtubule polymerisation and depolymerisation with directed cell elongation is sufficient to explain the limit to cell spreading and cell length homeostasis. Because microtubules appear to regulate cell length in a similar way in the developing zebrafish neural tube, we suggest that this microtubule-dependent mechanism is likely to be of widespread importance for the regulation of cell and tissue geometry."

When MTOR is inhibited, TFEB is dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus where it increases autophagy and lysosomal gene expression. As human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) Nef acts as an anti-autophagic maturation factor through interaction with beclin-1 (BECN1), we investigated the role of Nef and TFEB in the modulation of autophagy during HIV infection of human macrophages. We found that upon exposure to HIV, macrophages elicited an autophagic response through a toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) and BECN1 dependent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. However, once HIV infection is established, phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration of TFEB as well as autophagy revert to pre-infection levels. Moreover, this reversion is dependent upon the presence of HIV Nef. Collectively, the data suggests that the interaction between HIV and TLR8 serves as a signal for autophagy induction that is dependent upon the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. Once HIV establishes a productive infection, Nef binds BECN1 resulting in MTOR activation, TFEB phosphorylation and cytosolic sequestration and the inhibition of autophagy."

During 1974–2011, a total of 1866 cases of HFRS were recorded in Longquan, including 20 deaths. Strikingly, phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences sampled from local rodents in Longquan revealed the presence of novel variants of Gou virus (GOUV) in Rattus sp. rats and Hantaan virus (HTNV) in the stripe field mice, respectively. Moreover, viral sequences sampled from infected humans in Longquan were very closely related to those from rodents. Overall, these data indicate that there is a continual spillover GOUV and HTNV from rodents to humans in Longquan, and this might be responsible for the high prevalence of HFRS. As well as highlighting the importance of the human-animal interface, these data also suggest that GOUV is now the major cause of HFRS in this region."

Although some clinical and biological principles of seizures are known, many aspects of spontaneous human seizures remain poorly understood. Recordings from electrodes placed directly on and within the brain provide a unique view of seizure activity, and have revealed specific brain voltage patterns associated with this pathological state. In particular, there is evidence that organized waves of activity propagate over the brain during a seizure. However, quantitatively characterizing and understanding the mechanisms that support these waves remains an open challenge. The goal of this work is to address this challenge through a combination of mathematical modeling and clinical recordings. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we seek to understand general features that support the spatiotemporal patterns of seizure termination. We propose that a relatively simple and abstract mathematical model consisting of localized interactions of closely neighboring excitatory cells with slow adaptation can support the propagation of the waves found in clinical recordings. Improved understanding of the mechanisms supporting seizure activity promises novel developments in treatment strategies tailored to the observed activity of individual patients."

The current mathematical models of angiogenesis during fracture healing do not, however, implement all relevant biological scales (e.g. a tissue, cellular and intracellular level) rigorously in a multiscale framework. This study established a novel multiscale platform of angiogenesis during fracture healing (called MOSAIC) which allowed us to investigate the interactions of several influential factors across the different biological scales. We focused on the biological process of tip cell selection, during which a specific cell of a blood vessel, the “tip cell”, is selected to migrate away from the original vessel and lead the new branch. After showing that the MOSAIC model is able to correctly predict the bone regeneration process as well as many experimentally observed aspects of tip cell selection, we have used the model to investigate the influence of stimulating signals on the development of the vasculature and the progression of healing. These results raised an important biological question concerning the criterion for tip cell selection.

However, error-prone repair occasionally occurs, even when accurate repair is possible. We have investigated the genetic requirements of an error-prone break-repair mechanism called alternative end joining. We have previously shown that alternative end joining is frequently used in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we demonstrate that a fruit fly protein named DNA polymerase theta is a key player in this inaccurate repair mechanism. Genetic analysis suggests that polymerase theta may be important for two processes associated with alternative end joining: (1) annealing at short, complementary DNA sequences, and (2) DNA synthesis that creates small insertions at break-repair sites. In the absence of polymerase theta, a backup repair mechanism that frequently results in large chromosome deletions is revealed. Because DNA polymerase theta is highly expressed in many types of human cancers, our findings lay the groundwork for further investigations into how polymerase theta is involved in repair processes that may promote the development of cancer."

We found that the size of individual PA peaks is positively correlated with the usage of corresponding pA site, which is determined by the number of reads within the PA peak from latent to lytic KSHV infection, and the strength of cis-elements surrounding KSHV pA site determines the expression level of viral genes. Lastly, we identified and experimentally validated alternative polyadenylation of KSHV ORF54, T1.5, and K11 during viral lytic infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report on alternative polyadenylation events in KSHV infection."

Upon an infection, macrophages are being recruited to the site of infection by a number of different stimuli. In addition, during an infection, macrophages are also activated by cytokines such as interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α that is released from other immune cells. Such macrophage activation is important to achieve a rapid and efficient clearance of microbial pathogens. In this study, we found that macrophage activation induces uptake through macropinocytosis rather than receptor-mediate phagocytosis. As a consequence, microbial material as well as particles can be internalized far more efficiently; In addition, the internalized cargo is rapidly destroyed within lysosomes. We also provide the mechanisms for the switch from phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, which turned out to be the cytokine-induced phosphorylation of the host protein coronin 1. Phosphorylated coronin 1 activated the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which is known to be responsible for the entry of cargo through macropinocytosis. Together these results provide evidence for a hitherto unrecognized mechanisms to regulate the internalization and degradation of infectious material during an infection."

Chemotherapy with a combination of rifampicin and streptomycin for 8 weeks is the currently recommended treatment for all types of BU lesions, including both ulcerative and non-ulcerative stages (plaques, nodules and edema). Our histopathological analysis of twelve BU plaque lesions revealed extensive destruction of sub-cutaneous tissue. This frequently led to ulceration during antibiotic treatment. This should not be mistaken as a failure of the antimycobacterial chemotherapy, since we found no evidence for the persistence of active infection foci. Large necrotic areas were found to persist even after completion of antibiotic treatment. These may disturb wound healing and the role of wound debridement should therefore be formally tested in a clinical trial setting."

Our data for the first time demonstrate that type III interferon plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia, and its contribution is similar in both Gram positive and Gram negative infections. We show in epithelial cells that miR-21 and PDCD4 are downstream effectors of type III interferon that prolong production of inflammatory cytokines. Utilizing mice that lack the receptor for type III interferon or PDCD4, we show that inhibiting this pathway improves bacterial clearance from the airways and lung tissue. These data suggest novel targets for therapy in a variety of bacterial pneumonias."

The binding properties of antibodies are determined by the DNA sequences of their corresponding B cell receptors (BCRs). These BCR sequences are created in naive form by VDJ recombination, which randomly selects and trims the ends of V, D, and J genes, then joins the resulting segments together with additional random nucleotides. If they pass initial screening and bind an antigen, these sequences then undergo an evolutionary process of reproduction, mutation, and selection, revising the BCR to improve binding to its cognate antigen. It has recently become possible to determine the BCR sequences resulting from this process in high throughput. Although these sequences implicitly contain a wealth of information about both antigen exposure and the process by which we learn to resist pathogens, this information can only be extracted using computer algorithms. In this paper we describe a likelihood-based statistical method to determine, given a collection of BCR sequences, which of them are derived from the same recombination events. It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) of VDJ rearrangement which is able to calculate likelihoods for many sequences at once."

In this study, we revealed the essential role of MAVS in virus-induced apoptosis, independent of Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene I (RIG-I) signaling. Upon viral infection, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria, followed by MKK7 induced activation of JNK2, which subsequently initiates apoptosis. Importantly, we have clearly differentiated the roles of JNK2 versus JNK1, and MKK7 versus MKK4 in virus-induced apoptosis. Thus, we define a novel apoptotic signaling pathway, involving MAVS-MKK7-JNK2, which sheds a new perspective on the crosstalk between the antiviral and apoptotic signaling pathways in innate immunity."

Our understanding of the survival strategies, metabolism, and physiology of M. tuberculosis during intracellular growth remains incomplete. We employed multi-disciplinary approaches to gain new insights into adaptive responses that M. tuberculosis mobilizes to secure a productive infection. We simultaneously quantified replication and death rates, used electron microscopy to evaluate bacterial integrity, and determined the temporal changes in bacterial gene expression during a 14-day infection.

In eukaryotic cells, tRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase III (RNAP III). Proteins are composed of different amino acids, sequentially arranged according to the triplet sequence code, each carried to the ribosome by a different tRNA which reads or decodes the triplet sequence of the mRNA. After their synthesis by RNAP III, tRNAs are chemically modified by enzymes on multiple of their nucleosides. Here we report that one of these modifications, dimethyl-guanine-26 (m22G26) varies in the efficiency by which it is added to its target tRNAs, in a manner that is dependent on the overall activity rate of RNAP III. We show that this is important because the m22G26 modification activates the tRNA for function to translate the code. This link between RNAP III activity rate and m22G26 modification efficiency was previously unknown, and we show that it is conserved from yeast to human cells."

We examined the expression and relative importance of a gene family encoding six invertebrate-type lysozymes in the much-studied nematode C. elegans. The ilys genes exhibit distinct patterns of tissue-specific expression and response to pathogenic challenge and/or starvation. The most abundantly expressed, ilys-3, exhibits constitutive pharyngeal expression, which we show is essential for efficient disruption of bacteria under non-pathogenic growth conditions, and consequently it contributes to normal longevity. ilys-3 is also strongly up-regulated in intestinal cells after starvation or exposure to Gram-positive pathogens such as Microbacterium nematophilum and acts as a ‘slow-effector’ in limiting pathogenic damage from intestinal infections. We show that this induction by pathogens depends on the action of an ERK-MAPK cascade, which acts in pharyngeal rather than intestinal cells; this implies communication between pharynx and intestine. Tagged ILYS-3 protein was detected mainly in recycling endosomes of intestinal cells and in the intestinal lumen after starvation. ILYS-3 was also expressed in coelomocytes (scavenger cells) but we found that these cells make little or no contribution to defense. We examined the enzymatic properties of recombinant ILYS-3 protein, finding that it has lytic activity against M. nematophilum cell-walls."

Many plasmids encode transfer function allowing them to be transferred into plasmid-free bacteria by a process named conjugation. Since many of them also carry antibiotic resistance genes, plasmid-mediated conjugation is a major mechanism in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. In depth knowledge on the regulation of conjugation genes is a prerequisite to design measures interfering with the spread of antibiotic resistance. pLS20 is a conjugative plasmid of the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which is also a gut commensal in animals and humans. Here we describe in detail the molecular mechanism by which the key transcriptional regulator tightly represses the conjugation genes during conditions unfavorable to conjugation without compromising the ability to switch on accurately the conjugation genes when appropriate. We found that conjugation is subject to the control of a unique genetic switch where at least three levels of regulation are integrated. The first level involves overlapping divergent promoters of different strengths. The second layer involves a triple function of the transcriptional regulator. And the third level of regulation concerns formation of a DNA loop mediated by the transcriptional regulator."

APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F are cellular enzymes that decrease HIV-1's ability to replicate in a subsequent target cell if they are present in the virus particle. As a countermeasure, HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (vif) induces degradation of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, thereby preventing them from getting into the budding virus. Although vif-defective viruses cannot evade the antiviral effect of APOBEC3G, such viruses are very rarely present in HIV-1-infected humans. It is not yet known whether physiological variation in APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F expression in CD4+ T lymphocytes is substantial enough to reduce vif-positive HIV-1 infectivity. In this study, we found that T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, a subtype of CD4+ lymphocytes, expressed greater amounts of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F than T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. This difference led to a difference in infectivity of HIV-1 produced from the two cell types, whether vif was expressed or not. These results demonstrate that physiological regulation of APOBEC3G does restrict vif-positive HIV-1, as well as vif-negative HIV-1. In addition, this study reveals biological factors regulating expression of these proteins that may be exploitable for new therapeutic or preventive strategies against HIV-1."

To search for the ways of preventing and treating dengue infections we need to better understand their molecular mechanisms. As with many other viruses, dengue virus enters cells by fusion between the viral membrane and the membrane of intracellular vesicles (endosomes). In this work we explored the fusion stage of dengue virus entry in different experimental systems ranging from virus fusion to artificial lipid membranes to fusion inside the cells. While earlier work on dengue virus entry has focused on viral protein that mediates fusion, we found that effective action of this protein requires specific lipid composition of the membrane the virus fuses to. In effect, this lipid dependence allows virus to control intracellular location of the fusion event and, thus, the place of its RNA release by exploiting cell-controlled differences between lipid compositions of different organelles the virus travels through. The essential role of the interactions between dengue virus and its lipid cofactors during viral entry suggests that these interactions may be targeted in drug design."

Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been documented in the neighboring Cote d'Ivoire. Thus, it is plausible that the latter VHFs also occur in Ghana, and there have been rumors of cases, which present like VHF in the north of the country. Our study aimed at verifying or disproving this suspicion. At 18 hospital-based study sites in the Central and Northern part of the country, samples from 258 patients with VHF symptoms were collected and tested for various VHF by PCR. As viral hepatitis is an important differential diagnosis of yellow fever, we also tested for several serological and molecular hepatitis markers. Rather surprisingly, VHFs were not detected, indicating that, even if they are endemic in the North of Ghana, they do not significantly contribute to hospital morbidity. However, a large fraction of patients showed markers of acute hepatitis A, and active hepatitis B and C. Children were mainly affected by hepatitis A, while adults were affected by hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis A and B are vaccine-preventable, and chronic hepatitis B and C are treatable diseases. Further efforts are needed to reduce the burden of these diseases in Ghana."

In this study, we have performed a systematic modeling and analysis of allosteric activation in ABL and EGFR kinases at the increasing level of complexity - from catalytic domain to multi-domain regulatory complexes. The results of this study have revealed organizing structural and mechanistic principles of allosteric signaling in protein kinases. Although activation mechanisms in ABL and EGFR kinases have evolved through acquisition of structurally different regulatory complexes, we have found that long-range interdomain communication between common functional segments (αF-helix and αC-helix) may be important for allosteric activation. The results of study have revealed molecular signatures of activating cancer mutations and have shed the light on general mechanistic aspects of mutation-induced signaling in protein kinases. An advanced understanding and further characterization of molecular signatures of kinase mutations may aid in a better rationalization of mutational effects on clinical outcomes and facilitate molecular-based therapeutic strategies to combat kinase mutation-dependent tumorigenesis."

Many functions associated with epithelia require them to undergo extensive remodelling through changes in the shape and relative positions of constituent cells, a process about which we understand relatively little. The anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) is a specialized group of cells in the simple epithelium of the VE, and their stereotypic migratory behaviour is essential for establishing the orientation of the anterior-posterior axis in the early mouse embryo. We show that AVE migration is linked to changes in cell packing in the VE and an increase in “rosettes,” which are striking collections of five or more cells meeting at a central point. To probe the role of rosettes during AVE migration, we have developed a mathematical model of cell movement in the VE. Simulations suggest that rosettes are not essential for AVE migration, but are crucial for the orderliness of this migration. We also explored the role of Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signalling, which is known to coordinate cell polarization and rearrangement in many different tissues. We find that mutants in which PCP signalling is disrupted have fewer rosettes, altered epithelial packing, and abnormal AVE migration. We suggest that rosettes in the mouse VE are a PCP-dependent arrangement of cells that act to buffer the disturbances in cell packing generated by AVE migration, thereby enabling AVE cells to migrate in an orderly manner."

These reconstructed 3D cryoEM maps provide a unique challenge, since the resolutions are often sufficient to resolve a subset of the secondary structural features (e.g., long α-helices), but not high enough to unambiguously identify others (e.g., short α-helices, β-sheets, α-helix pitch, or overall connectivity of proteins). Various types of hierarchical structure refinement models of the data, including the atomistic model match and fitting, which is the subject of this paper are crucial in helping derive a more complete understanding of the structure and function relationships of biological complexes. Our protocol offers several advantages over existing fitting techniques. We introduce three new scoring terms to evaluate the quality of fitting, and the optimization of these functions lead to better predictions than existing tools like ADP-EM and Colores. Furthermore, we have adopted a non-uniform FFT-based search which is not only faster than regular FFT, but it also enables one to selectively perform more refined searches in localized regions, which is specially useful when fitting a small molecular component into a larger symmetric or asymmetric macromolecular structure."

Many experimental efforts have been dedicated to mapping regulatory regions in the genome but there are not many systematic methods that integrate functional data and regulatory sequences to predict the potential effect of any genetic variant on any given tissue and motif. Here we present a tissue and factor specific annotation that provides a predicted functional effect for both common and rare genetic variants. These predictions, certain of which are validated experimentally, show that the majority of genetic variants in gene regulatory regions are actually silent. Annotating those that are not silent allows us to investigate the molecular basis for the genetic architecture of many common traits and also to study the evolutionary properties that different types of regulatory sequences have across tissues or transcription factors. Overall, our study supports the concept that polygenic variation in binding sites for distinct classes of transcription factors has been a major target of evolutionary forces contributing to disease risk and complex trait variation in humans."

Species that infect humans are prevalent in developing countries, having a major impact on public health and well-being as well as an impediment to socioeconomic development. More people are infected with Schistosoma haematobium than with all the other schistosome species combined, however mainly due to the inability to maintain S. haematobium in the laboratory system empirical studies on this parasite are minimal. The genetic variation of this Schistosoma species on a wide geographical scale has never been investigated. In this study, we have used a DNA ?barcoding? approach to document the genetic variation and population structure of S. haematobium sampled from 18 countries across Africa and the Indian ocean Islands. The study revealed a distinct genetic separation of S. haematobium from the Indian Ocean Islands and the closely neighbouring coastal regions from S. haematobium found throughout the African mainland, the latter of which exhibited extremely low levels of mitochondrial diversity within and between populations of parasites sampled.

There is an urgent emerging need for improved methods of control for these currently neglected tick and tick borne diseases. It is hypothesized that a dual attenuated-live vector vaccine containing a stably transfected tick antigen elicits protective immune responses against the parasite and the tick vector in vaccinated cattle. Live Babesia vaccines based on attenuated parasites are the only effective method available for preventing acute babesiosis. On the other hand, glutathione-S-transferase from Haemaphysalis longicornis (HlGST) is a known effective antigen against Rhipicephalus microplus, the most common vector for B. bovis. This study describes the development and testing of a transfected, B. bovis vaccine expressing HlGST against the tick R. microplus. A B. bovis clonal line designated HlGST-Cln expressing HlGST and GFP/BSD, and separately a control transfected B. bovis clonal line expressing only GFP/BSD was used to vaccinate calves in two independent experiments. All immunized calves developed mild babesiosis, and only calves immunized with the HlGST-Cln parasite line generated anti-HlGST antibodies. Tick egg fertility and fully engorged female tick weight were reduced significantly in R. microplus feeding on HlGST-Cln-vaccinated calves. Taken together, these data demonstrates the ability of transfected B. bovis to elicit antibodies against a heterologous tick antigen in cattle and to induce partial protection in the vaccinated animals against the cattle tick for the first time, representing a step toward the goal to produce a live vector anti-tick vaccine."

Using RNA interference to reduce the expression of TRIM22, we showed that TRIM22 is a key mediator of the IFNβ response when expressed at natural levels. We demonstrate that TRIM22 blocks the intracellular trafficking of the viral structural protein Gag to the surface of the cell, and that the antiviral activity of TRIM22 is dependent on two cysteine residues (Cys15 and Cys18) that are critical for the E3 ligase activity of RING-containing proteins.

This virus occasionally infects humans with a high case mortality rate and poses a significant pandemic threat. Since neutralizing antibodies generally play a major role in protective immunity against influenza viruses, antibody therapy is a potential option for preventing highly lethal infection with the H5N1 virus in humans. Here we evaluated the protective potential of a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody with strong neutralizing activity against H5N1 viruses in mouse and nonhuman primate models of lethal H5N1 virus infection. The therapeutic use of the neutralizing antibody resulted in reduced viral loads and improved survival in animals infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. It was noted that the protective effects were more prominent in immunosuppressed macaques, which might provide a model of protection against severe clinical disease in immunocompromised patients. In addition, combination therapy together with an antiviral drug reduced the selection of escape mutants. Collectively, this study suggests that antibody therapy may have beneficial effects in clinical cases of H5N1 HPAI virus infection in humans."

These strategies are notably different from their predecessors and not without controversy. Many also require open release field trials to test their efficacy. Public consultation and engagement are recognized as critical to the future success of these programs, but questions remain regarding how to proceed. In this paper we describe an approach to public engagement that uses social research to design an engagement framework and communication materials tailored to the concerns, expectations, and socio-political setting of potential trial release sites. This approach was developed and implemented in Australia (2008–2010) where the first publicly supported field trials occurred January 2011. We report here on the implementation of this approach in Vietnam (2009–2010) where the second release will occur in 2014. This paper describes the process, research activities, outcomes and key findings from the Vietnamese field site. It highlights key public concerns and expectations about engagement and authorization and shows how these were used to develop a more targeted, culturally appropriate and comprehensible engagement framework and communication materials. The paper demonstrates the viability of this approach to community engagement for new dengue control strategies, in a ‘developing’ country context."

At the cell surface, external molecules become enclosed in membrane spheres called endosomes. Early endosomes serve as a sorting station, directing the contents (cargo molecules) to the correct compartment within the cell. This is thought to be achieved by the formation of membrane structures with distinct shape and function. For example, cargoes destined for recycling and degradation are processed through tubular membrane structures and big vesicular compartments, respectively. However, it is poorly understood how early endosome membranes are shaped into different structures. Here we show that two proteins, CHAT-1 and TAT-1, regulate membrane structure and are important for normal endocytic transport in the nematode worm C. elegans. TAT-1 and CHAT-1 are found in tubular membrane structures along the sorting and recycling pathway, where they enrich the outer membrane layer with a lipid called phosphatidylserine (PS) and probably change the membrane curvature. Loss of tat-1 and chat-1 function disrupts the asymmetric distribution of PS, abolishes tubular membrane structures, and abrogates endocytic sorting/recycling. Our data support a role of TAT-1/CHAT-1–regulated membrane PS asymmetry in promoting membrane tubulation for endocytic cargo sorting and recycling."

The base of these aggregates may be attached to a living or non-living surface. The biofilm matrix most often contains at least one exopolysaccharide component and may also contain protein and DNA. While much is known about the exopolysaccharide component of the Gram-negative biofilm matrix, little is known about the function of biofilm matrix proteins. We hypothesized that the biofilm matrix might harbor proteins with diverse functions. Therefore, we undertook the first proteomic analysis of the biofilm matrix of a Gram-negative bacterium, V. cholerae. We subsequently focused on Bap1 and RbmA, two proteins that are abundant in the biofilm matrix. RbmA, which strengthens intercellular interactions, was found to be evenly distributed in the biofilm. In contrast, communally synthesized Bap1 was concentrated at the biofilm-surface interface and stabilized the association of the multilayer biofilm with the surface. Furthermore, the addition of purified Bap1 increased attachment of free-swimming cells to a surface. These studies provide evidence for spatial and functional differentiation of proteins in the biofilm matrix and suggest bacterial cooperation in stabilization of multilayer biofilm surface association and recruitment of new members."

The paper provides a powerful example of evidence building for cost-effective early case detection in the visceral leishmaniasis elimination initiative of Bangladesh, India and Nepal. It compares the camp approach (mobile teams testing in chronic fever camps for spleen enlargement and rapid diagnostic tests) with the index case approach (screening for new cases in the neighbourhood of reported visceral leishmaniasis patients) and the incentive based approach (where basic health workers receive an allowance for detecting a new case) using subsequent house-to-house screening for the identification of the real number of un-detected cases. By applying a mix of different study methods and an itinerate research process to identify the most effective, feasible and affordable case detection method, under different environmental conditions, recommendations could be developed which help governments in shaping their visceral leishmaniasis elimination strategy."

They may influence an individual's susceptibility to disease or response to drugs through their impacts on a protein's structure and hence cause functional changes. In this paper, we present a new methodology to estimate the impact of nsSNPs on disease susceptibility. This is made possible by characterising the protein structure and the change of structural stability due to nsSNPs. We show that our computer program Bongo, which describes protein structures as interlinked amino acids, can identify conformational changes resulting from nsSNPs that are closely associated with pathological consequences. Bongo requires only structural information to analyze nsSNPs and thus is complementary to methods that use evolutionary information. Bongo helps us investigate the suggestion that most disease-causing mutations disturb structural features of proteins, thus affecting their stability. We anticipate that making Bongo available to the community will facilitate a better understanding of disease-associated nsSNPs and thus benefit personal medicine in the future."

Chromatoid bodies, which are present in spermatids, contain RNA and protein, are not enclosed by membranes, and typically reside close to the nucleus. Without TDRD6, a much distorted CB structure is observed, and this work asked for the functional contribution of TDRD6 to spermatids. We found that TDRD6 is required for localization of an RNA degradation machinery to the CB. This so-called nonsense mediated decay (NMD) machinery, known from somatic cells, destroys mRNAs that feature premature stop codons. Absence of TDRD6 significantly impairs one specific mechanism of NMD, which depends on long 3’ untranslated regions of the transcripts. Thus, the CB component TDRD6 acts in the assembly of the NMD machinery in the CB."

It is known that organ growth is the product of two systems: an intrinsic system that coordinates cell proliferation with the specification of cell fate (patterning), and an extrinsic system that synchronizes growth with nutrient levels. Developing organs integrate these two inputs to ensure that properly proportioned structures develop which are of the right scale to match overall body size. However, the mechanisms used to integrate these distinct growth control systems have remained largely mysterious. In this study, we have addressed how intrinsic and extrinsic systems combine to drive growth of the Drosophila wing. Focusing on the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway—a major, nutrient-dependent regulator of organ growth—and Yorkie—the transcriptional activator downstream of the Hippo pathway and a key, organ-intrinsic growth regulator—we have identified a circuit in which TOR activity limits Yorkie’s capacity to promote wing growth, in part through a novel mode of transcription factor regulation that we term “nuclear seclusion.” We find that inhibiting TOR leads to the retention of Yorkie in the nucleus but diminishes its transcriptional activity by diverting it away from target genes. We posit that subjugating Yorkie in this way contributes to how fluctuations in TOR activity scale wing size according to nutrient levels."

Caused by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira, it has greater incidence in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease has become prevalent in cities with sanitation problems and a large population of urban rodent reservoirs, which contaminate the environment through their urine. Understanding the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of leptospirosis should contribute to new strategies that would help fight the disease. We show in this work that Leptospira strains, virulent, attenuated or saprophytic are capable of binding fibrinogen (Fg). The interaction of leptospires with Fg inhibits the formation of fibrin clot that may result of an imbalance in the haemostatic equilibrium. In addition, we show that plasminogen (PLG)/plasmin (PLA) generation on the surface of leptospires can lead to Fg degradation, showing evidence of possible route of fibrinolysis in leptospirosis. We also present six leptospiral proteins, as novel Fg-binding proteins, capable of inhibiting fibrin clot formation by thrombin-catalyzed reaction, suggesting that in Leptospira these multifunctional proteins could mediate Fg interaction. Our data suggest possible mechanisms that leptospires could employ to affect the coagulation cascade and fibrinolytic system that might lead to bacteria spreading."

These findings show that viral populations carry a measurable load of host DNA sequences, further supporting the role of viruses as vectors of horizontal transfer of DNA between insect species. The potential uncontrolled gene spread associated with the use of viruses produced in insect cells as gene delivery vectors and/or biopesticides should therefore be evaluated."

Correlations of activity in such networks are of interest in a variety of fields, from gene-regulatory networks to neuroscience. Due to novel experimental techniques allowing the recording of the activity of many pairs of neurons and their importance with respect to the functional interpretation of spike data, spike train correlations in neural networks have recently attracted a considerable amount of attention. Although origin and function of these correlations is not known in detail, they are believed to have a fundamental influence on information processing and learning. We present a detailed explanation of how recurrent connectivity induces correlations in local neural networks and how structural features affect their size and distribution. We examine under which conditions network characteristics like distance dependent connectivity, hubs or patches markedly influence correlations and population signals."

Our limited knowledge of where and when people get exposed to the vector (Anopheles balabacensis) has resulted in poor control measures, although it is assumed that exposure occurs primarily when people are working in forest areas. We investigated the role of peri-domestic (outdoors but around the household) and domestic transmission. Mosquitoes were collected at 28 pairs households composed of one where an occupant had a confirmed knowlesi malaria infection and an associated “control” where no infection was reported. Most of the vectors were caught outdoors from 6pm - 9pm. The vectors were also significantly more abundant in the peri-domestic area than inside houses (5.5-fold), and also higher at case than control households. Ten Anopheles (out of 641) were found positive for primate malaria parasites. This study shows that humans can be exposed to knowlesi infection around their homes. Given the vectors are mainly outdoor biters, interventions using insecticide treated bednets inside households may have relatively little impact. A paradigm shift in control methods is required to reduce infection of this primate malaria."

Furthermore , found clear correlation dendrite shape distribution activator , providing morphological criterion predict vivo distribution hypothetical molecular complexes responsible dendrite elongation branching .","Neurons elaborate two types of neuronal extensions. One is axon, which sends outputs to other neurons. Another is dendrite, which is specialized for receiving and processing synaptic or sensory inputs. Like elaborated branches of trees, the shape of dendrites is quite variable from one type to another, and different dendritic geometry contributes to differential informational processing and computation. For instance, neurons of the space-filling type (e.g., retinal ganglion cells) fill in an open space to pick up spatial information from every corner of their receptive field. Therefore, dendrite development is one of the representative examples of the emergence of function through morphogenesis. Previous experiments including ours showed that competitive dendro-dendritic interactions play critical roles in shaping dendrites of the space-filling type. In the present study, we incorporated this finding in constructing a new mathematical model, in which reaction dynamics of chemicals are coupled to neuronal dendrite growth. Our numerical analysis suggested that self-organizing property of the proposed system underlies formation of space-filling dendrites. Furthermore, we provided a morphological criterion to predict the in vivo distribution of the hypothetical molecular complexes responsible for dendrite elongation and branching. We have now found a substantial number of molecules involved in dendrite development, thus it is timely to discuss the prediction from this work."

In general, ferritin levels are increased in inflammatory conditions, but in this study we found that ferritin levels were much higher in dengue virus infected patients than in patients with other febrile illnesses. This indicates that ferritin could be used as a marker to discriminate between dengue and other febrile diseases. Moreover, the presence of hyperferritinaemia (ferritin levels≥500 µg/L) was associated with markers of immune activation and coagulation disturbances and clinical disease severity, suggesting that it could serve as a marker of activity of disease. Clinical markers to determine the presence and severity of dengue virus infection are important for diagnostic and treatment purposes. Our results indicate that increased ferritin levels could be used to increase the likelihood on a positive dengue diagnosis. Moreover, patients with hyperferritinaemia should be monitored carefully, because they are at risk to develop severe disease due to extensive immune activation."

For example, we cannot yet predict how a genetic defect in a muscle protein will result in a physiological change in the heart. This multi-scale understanding is difficult, in part, because molecules cooperate during muscle contraction; that is, one molecule’s behavior is influenced by the behavior of its neighbors. It is difficult to make direct measurements from such coupled molecular systems and also difficult to describe them quantitatively. Despite these obstacles, we recently published experimental measurements and theoretical models of this coupling, but there were apparent discrepancies between the two. Here, we use detailed computer simulations of these experiments to show that, in fact, the measurements agree with the model to a remarkable extent. This agreement suggests that the model captures the essential molecular events that underlie the coupling between muscle molecules. This removes a major obstacle to a multi-scale understanding of muscle contraction and, while more work is necessary, suggests that a connection between the molecular and macroscopic scale is within reach."

The function of the receptor itself is regulated via so-called pre-mRNA editing, i.e. site-specific adenosine deamination in five distinct sites. The greater the number of edited sites in the serotonin receptor mRNA, the lower the activity of the receptor it encodes. Here we used the results of extensive massively parallel sequencing from human and rat brains to elucidate the dependencies among the editing states of the five sites. Despite the apparent simplicity of the problem, disambiguation of these dependencies is a difficult task that required development of a new statistical technique. We employed this method to analyse the dependencies among editing in the 5 susceptible sites of the receptor mRNA and found that the proximal, juxtaposed sites A and B are strongly interdependent, and that the editing state of these two sites is a major determinant of the editing states of the other three sites, and hence the overall editing pattern. The statistical approach we developed for the analysis of mRNA editing can be applied to other cases of multiple site modification in RNA and proteins."

While the timing of the early steps of HIV-1 replication is quite well understood, measuring the duration of later steps is complicated by the fact that asynchrony is introduced into populations of infected cells during early steps. We devised imaging methods for measuring the duration of late steps in HIV-1 replication in single infected cells, circumventing the problems associated with measurements in populations of asynchronously infected cells. By combining these measurements with conventional analyses of HIV-1 replication in populations of cells, we derived a time-line of key events during the late steps of the HIV-1 life cycle. We find that the delay between early and late gene expression is small but that a subsequent programmed delay in virus assembly enables HIV-1 to remove a host antiviral protein from infected cells before new virions are generated. In so doing, HIV-1 may prevent futile virion production."

Studying the HLA peptide ligands of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infected cells, we realized that the HCMV encoded glycoprotein US11 targeted different HLA gene products in distinct manners. More than 20 years ago the first HCMV encoded MHC-I inhibitors were identified, including US11, targeting MHC-I for proteasomal degradation. Here, we describe that the prime target for US11-mediated degradation is HLA-A, whereas HLA-B can resist degradation. Our further mechanistic analysis revealed that US11 uses various domains for distinct functions. Remarkably, the ability of US11 to interact with assembled MHC-I and modify peptide loading of degradation-resistant HLA-B was dependent on a low-complexity region (LCR) located between the signal peptide and the immunoglobulin-like domain of US11. To redirect MHC-I for proteasomal degradation the LCR was dispensable. These findings now raise the intriguing question why US11 has evolved to target HLA-A and -B differentially. Possibly, HLA-B molecules are spared in order to dampen NK cell attack against infected cells."

Although widely considered to be necessary for promoter activity, their exact function is unknown. CpG islands are mostly unmethylated during development and differentiate with notable exceptions including imprinted genes and genes on the inactive X chromosome. Here we analysed how the imprinted Airn ncRNA CpG island, that is normally methylated on the maternal and unmethylated on the paternal chromosome, regulates its associated upstream promoter. We used embryonic stem cells or mice carrying a deletion of either the whole CpG island or of the second half that contains an unusual series of tandem direct repeats. Our results show that the CpG island is needed for efficient transcription of the Airn promoter on the paternal chromosome and to keep it free from DNA methylation. The series of tandem direct repeats plays a minor role in regulating the length of the Airn transcript on the paternal chromosome but is essential for DNA methylation of the Airn promoter on the maternal chromosome. These results show that CpG islands do not only function as classical promoters to bind RNA polymerase II and initiate transcription, but can also play other roles in regulating transcription processivity as well as the epigenetic state of their associated promoter."

In particular, we show that the independent loss of a symbiosis in several plant lineages results in a convergent modification of non-host genomes. Interestingly, a significant fraction of genes lost in non-hosts play an important role in this symbiosis, supporting the use of comparative genomics as a powerful approach to identify undiscovered gene networks."

These different phenotypes are thought to result from an increased copy of one more of the genes on chromosome 21, but it is not known which gene or genes cause the phenotypes. Using a panel of mouse strains with an extra copy of different sets of mouse genes that are equivalent to the human genes on chromosome 21 we were able to show that an extra copy of a small number of genes was sufficient to cause motor abnormalities in the mice, and that one of these genes, Dyrk1a, was required in three copies for this phenotype. Furthermore, we found that these mouse models of Down Syndrome showed loss of motor neurons, which could account in part for the motor dysfunction. This result led us to look in spinal cords from humans with DS, where we also found decreased numbers of motor neurons, a phenotype that has never been previously reported."

While theoretically this would only be a matter of counting the number of newly infected individuals, in reality these data are difficult to acquire due to limited sampling possibilities and undetectable cases. This means that a method must be used to estimate the real incidence using a limited amount of data. For many infections, the concentration and quality of antibodies changes predictably over time, which means that one could use the antibody level at any point in time to back-calculate how much time passed since the infection entered the body. Other information, such as the age of the individual, or the presence of the pathogen, can also help to estimate when an individual became infected. Improving on existing methods, we developed a method that allows the use of a wide range of information sources for estimating individual time since infection. Using arenavirus infection in mice, we show that this method works well when sufficient background data are available, and that it can greatly improve the estimation of incidence patterns."

Here we use two closely-matched autocatalytic recombinant PrP conformers that share the same origin but differ by >105-fold in specific infectivity to study the molecular basis of prion infectivity. We show that infectious and non-infectious autocatalytic recombinant PrP conformers have subtle structural differences, and that GPI-anchored PrP substrate molecules can only adopt the infectious PrPSc conformation.

This mechanism may help the pathogen to initiate the inflammatory response in the intestinal epithelium. This study provides insight into the mechanisms by which Salmonella Typhimurium causes diarrhea.

Genomes also can accumulate selfish DNA elements. Duplication events specifically are often followed by extensive gene loss. The maize genome is particularly extreme, having become tetraploid 10 million years ago and played host to massive transposon amplifications. We compared the genome of sorghum (which is homologous to the pre-tetraploid maize genome) with the two identifiable parental genomes retained in maize. The two maize genomes differ greatly: one of the parental genomes has lost 2.3 times more genes than the other, and the selfish DNA regions between genes were even more frequently lost, suggesting maize can distinguish between the parental genomes present in the original tetraploid. We show that genes are actually lost, not simply relocated. Deletions were rarely longer than a single gene, and occurred between repeated DNA sequences, suggesting mis-recombination as a mechanism of gene removal. We hypothesize an epigenetic mechanism of genome distinction to account for the selective loss. To the extent that the rate of base substitutions tracks time, we neither support nor refute claims of maize allotetraploidy. Finally, we explain why it makes sense that purifying selection in mammals does not operate at all like the gene and genome deletion program we describe here."

Relapsing fever spirochetes are one such pathogen causing a significant health burden, yet the pathogenesis, ecology, and distribution of B. turicatae is understudied. To address these shortcomings, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of the Borrelia immunogenic protein A (BipA) in isolates of B. turicatae. Mice and a canine were also infected by tick bite and transmission and serological responses were evaluated in these two likely mammalian hosts. B. turicatae was visualized within the blood of both animals and antibody responses generated against recombinant BipA indicated that the antigen that may be unique to infections caused by B. turicatae. Moreover, mice continued to generate antibodies a year after tick bite, suggesting a persistent infection. Our results indicate that the immune responses generated against BipA could identify additional vertebrate hosts, define endemic foci for B. turicatae, and increase the awareness of the disease to improve healthcare."

Overall , report uncovers new role protein methylation regulatory pathway molecular chaperones defines novel regulatory mechanism chaperone VCP , deregulation causative degenerative neuromuscular diseases .","Methylation, or transfer of a single or multiple methyl groups (CH3), is one of many post-translational modifications that occur on proteins. Such modifications can, in turn, affect numerous aspects of a protein, notably cellular localization, turnover, activity, and molecular interactions. In addition to post-translational modifications, the structural organization of a protein or protein complex can also have a significant impact on its function and stability. A group of factors known as “molecular chaperones” aid newly synthesized proteins in reaching their native conformation or alternating between physiologically relevant states. We present here a new family of factors that promote methylation of chaperones and show that, at least in one case, this modification translates into a modulation in the activity of the substrate chaperone. Our results not only characterize the function of previously unknown gene products, uncover a new role for protein methylation as a regulatory pathway for chaperones, and define a novel regulatory mechanism for the chaperone VCP, whose deregulation is causative of neuromuscular diseases, but also suggest the existence of a post-translational modification code that regulates molecular chaperones. Further decrypting this “chaperone code” will help understanding how the functional organization of the proteome is orchestrated."

Incidence of intestinal helminth infections is high due to both socio-economic factors that facilitates continuous re-infections and the lack of effective vaccines. In this context, further knowledge on the host-parasite relationships is required to elucidate the factors that determine the expulsion of the intestinal helminths or, in contrast, the chronic establishment of the infections. Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda) is an intestinal trematode that has been extensively used as experimental model to investigate these factors. Depending on the host species. E. caproni is rapidly rejected or develops chronic infections. Herein, we analyze the changes in protein expression induced by E. caproni infection in a host in which the parasites develop chronic infections. These data may serve to get a better understanding of the factors determining the development of chronic intestinal infections. A total of 37 spots were identified differentially expressed. These proteins were related to the restoration of the intestinal epithelium and the control of homeostatic dysregulation, mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins among others. This suggests that the changes in these processes in the intestinal mucosa may facilitate the development of chronic infections."

Here we show that POLQ-defective mammalian cells are selectively susceptible to double-strand breaks in DNA. We present experiments in mammalian cells showing that a specific double-strand break repair pathway is POLQ-dependent. To analyze the repair function in more detail, we examined class switch joining between DNA segments in antibody genes. Insertions of DNA bases are sometimes found at the joins between such segments, but the origin of these insertions has been mysterious. We show that this class of insertion joins during immunoglobulin class-switching is entirely POLQ-dependent. In experiments with purified human POLQ protein, we found a novel biochemical mechanism explaining the formation of the insertions. POLQ has a unique biochemical ability to extend DNA with minimal base pairing. Finally, we examined the biological consequences for chromosome stability. Unexpectedly, the Burkitt lymphoma translocation (a major cancer-associated genome instability) is enhanced in the absence of POLQ. This alters the current view about the action of DNA end joining in mammalian cells, revealing that a POLQ-dependent DNA repair pathway combats potentially damaging chromosome translocations."

Previous studies showed specific β-catenin dosage favors Wnt signaling-dependent tumorigenesis for some tumor types. However, earlier studies emphasized the role of constitutional Ctnnb1 and Apc gene variations, rather than somatic gene targeting, and the work focused on small intestine tumors and no effects on colon tumor phenotypes were described. Furthermore, definitive insights were lacking into how reduced Ctnnb1 gene dosage affected Apc mutation-dependent tumorigenesis. Here, we show somatic inactivation of one Ctnnb1 allele dramatically inhibits mouse colon adenomatous polyposis induced by somatic bi-allelic Apc inactivation. In contrast, Ctnnb1 hemizygous inactivation does not affect mouse ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma development arising from Apc- and Pten-inactivation. Ctnnb1 hemizygous gene dose dramatically reduces the active pool of β-catenin, leading to the significant inhibition of β-catenin/TCF-regulated target gene expression, including those encoding key stem cell regulatory and crypt compartmentalization factors in colon epithelium. Tissue-specific differences for expression of selected β-catenin/TCF-regulated genes, such as Myc, may contribute to the context-dependent effects of Ctnnb1 gene dosage in Apc mutation-driven colon and ovarian tumors."

Histoplasma antigen detection tests are an important addition to the diagnostic arsenal for patients with advanced HIV disease and should be considered for inclusion on the World Health Organization Essential Diagnostics List. Our objective was to systematically review the literature to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Histoplasma antigen tests in the context of advanced HIV disease, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries. Systematic review of the published literature extracted data on comparator groups, type of histoplasmosis, HIV status, performance results, patient numbers, whether patients were consecutively enrolled or if the study used biobank samples. At the end of the screening process we included a total of 16 studies in humans for further analysis. Most studies included used a heterogeneous group of patients, often without HIV or mixing HIV and non HIV patients, with disseminated or non-disseminated forms of histoplasmosis. Patient numbers were generally small in individual studies and, in most of these, no confidence intervals were given. When considering the diagnostic accuracy of Histoplasma antigen detection tests evaluated among consecutive HIV-infected patients with confirmed histoplasmosis, the performance of the tests was good. These non invasive diagnostic tools would be very useful for HIV care givers at the level of reference hospitals or hospitals with the infrastructure to perform ELISA tests. Antigen detection tests are promising tools to improve detection of and ultimately reduce the burden of histoplasmosis mortality in patients with advanced HIV disease."

If what we were taught were true, there is no reason to expect the two genes to lie together. What we find—using two different techniques (cutting/ligating nearby sequences, and super-resolution microscopy)—is that the two genes are initially apart; then the parts of the genes being transcribed at a particular moment transiently come into close proximity.

An abundant protein modification is N-terminal acetylation, in which an N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group to the very N-terminal amino acid of the protein. When going from lower to higher eukaryotes there is a significant increase in the occurrence of N-terminal acetylation. We demonstrate here that this is partly because higher eukaryotes uniquely express NatF, an enzyme capable of acetylating a large group of protein N-termini including those previously found to display an increased N-acetylation potential in higher eukaryotes. Thus, the current study has possibly identified the last major component of the eukaryotic machinery responsible for co-translational N-acetylation of proteins. All eukaryotic proteins start with methionine, which is co-translationally cleaved when the second amino acid is small. Thereafter, NatA may acetylate these newly exposed N-termini. Interestingly, NatF also has the potential to act on these types of N-termini where the methionine was not cleaved. At the cellular level, we further found that NatF is essential for normal chromosome segregation during cell division."

Although it can infect virtually any warm-blooded animal, its definitive host is the cat where the sexual cycle occurs in enterocytes of the small intestine, producing microscopic, durable oocysts that are shed in feces and can remain infectious for extended periods of time in the environment. Two parasite genes, AAH1 and AAH2, code for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, which produce L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine. However, L-DOPA is also a precursor of other structural molecules including dityrosine, which may play a role in the wall of the oocyst. We investigated the effect of AAH deletion on the ability of the parasites to undergo sexual reproduction in cats, and found that AAH-deficient parasites were defective in their ability to produce oocysts, and those oocysts were partially defective in their ability to undergo maturation once produced. Collectively, these results suggest that the AAH genes play their primary role in transmission through the definitive host."

In computational simulation experiments reported here, we explored the foundations of an architectonic type principle, which attributes adult cortical connectivity to the differences in architectonic differentiation between cortical areas. Architectonic differentiation refers, among other characteristics, to the cellular composition of cortical areas. This architectonic type principle has been found to account for diverse properties of cortical connectivity across mammalian species. Our in silico model generated connectivity patterns that were consistent with the architectonic type principle, as they are typically observed in mammalian cortices, if model settings were chosen such that they corresponded to empirical observations of cortical development. Our computational experiments systematically evaluated previously proposed mechanisms of cortical development and showed that connectivity consistent with the architectonic type principle arose only from realistic assumptions about the growth of the cortical sheet."

The identification of a closely related viral species, called Murid herpesvirus 4 with the main strain called murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68), in wild rodents opened new horizons to the study of gammaherpesvirus biology. Surprisingly, despite 30 years of research, MHV-68 transmission had never been observed in captivity. In this study, using in vivo imaging, we showed that MHV-68 is genitally excreted after latency establishment in intranasally infected female mice. This allowed us to observe, for the first time, sexual transmission of MHV-68 between laboratory mice.

In phagocytic protozoa, phagocytosis is involved in the acquisition of nutrients, and the evasion from the host immune system and inflammation. While hydrolytic enzymes that are essential for the efficient and regulated degradation of phagocytosed particles, such as bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotic organisms, have been characterized, the mechanisms of the transport of these proteins are poorly understood. In the present study, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the molecular mechanisms of how the digestive enzymes are transported to phagosomes. Understanding of such mechanisms of the transport of phagosomal proteins at the molecular level may lead to the identification of a novel target for the development of new preventive measures against parasitic infections caused by phagocytic protozoa."

Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, the study assessed the effectiveness of the BUPaT programme to improve early detection and management of BU in an endemic area in Ghana. The results of the study showed extensive collaboration across all levels, (national, municipality and community), which contributed to strengthening the programme. Health staff were trained to manage all BU cases. School teachers, municipal environmental staff and community surveillance volunteers were trained to give the right health messages, screen for detection of early cases and refer for medical treatment. WHO-recommended antibiotics improved treatment and cure, particularly for early lesions, and prevented recurrences. Improving access to antibiotic treatment is critical for early case management. Health education is required to emphasise the effectiveness of treatment with antibiotics to reduce deformities and the importance of seeking medical treatment for all skin lesions. Further research is needed to explain the role of environmental factors in BU contagion."

It uses a molecular syringe to inject effector molecules into these predatory host cells, reprograming them to support L. pneumophila growth. Upon inhalation of contaminated aerosols, L. pneumophila uses the same approach to replicate in human alveolar macrophages, which can result in a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease. However, L. pneumophila is normally controlled by the innate immune system, and the key mechanisms and cells involved in this immune response remain unclear. Here we show that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dominant role in the clearance of L. pneumophila from the lung. Neutrophils kill L. pneumophila using ROS, while alveolar macrophages are activated by TNF produced by neutrophils and monocytes that are recruited to the lung. TNF-activated alveolar macrophages kill L. pneumophila by recruiting lysosomes and acidifying L. pneumophila containing vacuoles. Caspases other than caspase-1 and 11 are involved in this mechanism, with a minor contribution from cysteine-type cathepsins or calpains. This study deepens our understanding of the mechanisms by which TNF contributes to the control of intracellular pathogens, and highlights the key elements of the innate immune response to L. pneumophila lung infection."

We also propose a way of mathematically modeling dynamic belief updates which is based on the very well established concept of a belief as a probability distribution and its temporal evolution as a direct application of the Bayes theorem. We also propose the use of logarithmic pooling as an optimal way of combining different opinions which must be considered when making a decision. To argue for the relevance of this issue, we present a model of vaccinating behaviour with dynamic belief updates, modeled after real scenarios of vaccine and disease scare recorded in the recent literature."

Microsporidia are fungal-related intracellular pathogens that can infect all animals, but are poorly understood. We used the roundworm C. elegans as a host to show that ubiquitin pathways provide defense against both a natural microsporidian infection of C. elegans, as well as a natural viral infection. Our study shows that ubiquitin, the proteasome and autophagy components are all important to control intracellular infection in C. elegans, although microsporidia seem to partially evade this defense. We also show that SCF ubiquitin ligases help control both microsporidia and virus infection. Furthermore, we find that C. elegans upregulates expression of SCF ligases when ubiquitin-related degradation machinery is inhibited, indicating that C. elegans monitors the functioning of this core cellular process and upregulates ligase expression when it is perturbed. Altogether, our findings describe ubiquitin-mediated pathways that are involved in host response and defense against intracellular pathogens, and how this machinery is regulated by infection to increase defense against intracellular pathogens such as microsporidia and viruses."

The                    clinical manifestations of chronic T. cruzi infection include                    the latent form (the indeterminate chronic form), the cardiac form, the                    digestive or cardiodigestive form, and sudden death. Therefore, many diagnoses                    of Chagas disease are based on epidemiological suspicion rather than on clinical                    signs and symptoms.

Up to 3% of the world's population are chronically infected with its causative agent, the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). This capacity to establish long (decades) lasting persistent infection sets HCV apart from other plus-strand RNA viruses typically causing acute, self-limiting infections. A prerequisite for its capacity to persist is HCV's complex and tightly regulated intracellular replication strategy. In this study, we therefore wanted to develop a comprehensive understanding of the molecular processes governing HCV RNA replication in order to pinpoint the most vulnerable substeps in the viral life cycle. For that purpose, we used a combination of biological experiments and mathematical modeling. Using the model to study HCV's replication strategy, we recognized diverse but crucial roles for the membraneous replication compartment of HCV in regulating RNA amplification. We further predict the existence of an essential limiting host factor (or function) required for establishing active RNA replication and thereby determining cellular permissiveness for HCV. Our model also proved valuable to understand and predict the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of HCV and might be a solid basis for the development of similar models for other plus-strand RNA viruses."

This reduction in the genome's content is achieved through a specialized type of division, where a single round of DNA replication is followed by two successive rounds of chromosome segregation. The first round separates the homologs. For this to faithfully occur, homologous chromosomes pair with each other and experience recombination, catalyzed by the formation of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs). Upon their repair, a subset of DSBs will generate crossovers, which result from an intermediate that creates a physical link between homologs and allows their correct segregation by the meiotic spindle. DSBs, as well as crossovers, do not occur randomly along chromosomes but at preferential places called hotspots. To ask if all DSB hotspots also give rise to high crossover frequency, we have systematically compared the map of DSBs with that of a protein, Zip3, which we show preferentially binds to DSB sites that are being repaired with a crossover. We discovered that several DSB hotspots rarely produce crossovers, meaning that the decision to repair a DSB with a crossover can be influenced by specific chromosomal features."

The adaptation of viruses to their hosts is facilitated by fast mutation and constrained by small genome sizes, which are both due to the extremely high error rate of viral polymerases. Using an innovative computational approach, we now provide evidence for additional forces that may control genome size and, consequently, affect virus adaptation to the host. We analyzed nidoviruses, a monophyletic group of viruses that populate the upper ∼60% of the RNA virus genome size scale. They evolved a conserved genomic architecture, and infect vertebrate and invertebrate species. Those nidoviruses that have the largest known RNA genomes uniquely encode a 3′-to-5′exoribonuclease, a homolog of canonical DNA proof-reading enzymes that improves their replication fidelity. We show that nidoviruses accumulated mutations on par with that observed in the Tree of Life for comparable protein datasets, although the time scale of nidovirus evolution remains unknown. Extant nidovirus genomes of different size reached particular points on a common trajectory of genome expansion. This trajectory may be shaped by the division of labor between open reading frames that predominantly control genome replication, genome expression, and virus dissemination, respectively. Ultimately, genomic architecture may determine the observed genome size limit in contemporary RNA viruses."

Despite the relevance of ECM for T. cruzi infection, the signaling pathways triggered in trypomastigotes upon interactions with ECM are less well understood. In previous work we demonstrated the dephosphorylation of proteins, such as α-tubulin, paraflagellar rod proteins and ERK 1/2 in trypomastigotes incubated with either laminin or fibronectin. Further, we described changes in the S-nitrosylation and nitration pattern of proteins from trypomastigote incubated with ECM. To expand our knowledge on ECM triggered parasite signaling we applied quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies to trypomastigotes incubated with ECM (MTy) compared to controls (Ty). Our results indicate relevant changes in total protein and phosphoprotein profiles in MTy. The kinases implicated in the modifications were suggested by bioinformatic analyses, as well as the number of modifications and the frequency of amino acids per peptide that have been modified. Proteins involved in metabolic processes, including enzymes from the glycolytic pathway, phosphatases and kinases were the most representative groups among the proteins modified by phosphorylation. Quantification of metabolites in MTy and Ty also indicated that glucose metabolism is impaired in trypomastigotes incubated with ECM. The significant inhibition of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in MTy associated with phosphorylation levels, strongly suggests that trypomastigotes reprogram their metabolism in response to interaction with the extracellular matrix, an obligatory step prior to host cell invasion."

Mutations within the HIV-1 genome allow the virus to escape recognition by CTLs and so evade the immune response. These escape mutations have been well documented but observed waiting times to escape within an individual have ranged from days to years. Many studies describing CTL escape have taken a detailed look at a few patients. Our analysis is based on a cohort of 125 clinical trial participants with immunologic and viral sequence data taken at regular longitudinal time points within the first few years of infection. Results suggested that the majority of CTL-related mutations present early in infection had been transmitted in the infecting viral strain as opposed to arising in the new host due to selection pressure imposed by CTLs. Whilst the prevalence of CTL escape mutations in the dataset was high, the incidence of new escape was relatively low; around one third of patients did not drive an escape within the first two years. Patients possessing a ‘protective’ HLA genotype had a significantly shorter waiting time to first escape than those without."

One such pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, is able to grow within macrophages in the lungs, thereby causing a form of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ Disease. L. pneumophila causes disease by translocating several hundred proteins into the host cell. These proteins are typically referred to as ‘‘effectors’’, as they function as toxins to alter normal host cell function. However, since L. pneumophila remains within the host cells for approximately one day, continual poisoning of the eukaryotic cells by the bacterial effectors will result in the premature death of the host cell, thus restricting the growth of the pathogen. Previously the L. pneumophila secreted protein LubX was described as a “metaeffector”, which has been defined as an effector that acts directly on another effector to modulate its function inside the host cell. LubX accomplishes this task by directing the degradation of another effector, SidH. Here we report a second L. pneumophila metaeffector, SidJ, acts in a similar manner to neutralize SidE family effectors by removing them from the intracellular compartment that contains the bacterium. This further establishes the concept of metaeffectors, which are likely to be critical to how Legionella and many other pathogens cause disease."

Our approach is applicable to a wide range of diseases and available in a free software package called outbreaker."

Its causative agent, dengue virus (DENV), has immunologically distinct serotypes that increase the risk of life-threatening diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. However, an effective medication for dengue has not yet been established. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop new antivirals and vaccines against DENV. Here, we have characterized C19orf66, named Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN), as a cellular gene that inhibits the replication of all DENV serotypes. The expression of RyDEN was found to be upregulated by interferon (IFN) treatment and played a critical role in the IFN-mediated anti-DENV response. We also found that RyDEN was likely to block the protein translation of DENV RNA through its association with cellular mRNA-binding proteins and viral RNA. Intriguingly, replication of several other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, Kunjin virus, and Chikungunya virus, was also limited by RyDEN expression. Thus, this study describes a novel mechanism of an IFN-inducible inhibitory factor for DENV and provides the basis for future development of broad-spectrum antivirals against infectious viral diseases, including dengue."

In this paper, we further improve our annotation through integrating a rich collection of epigenomic data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. We introduce GenoSkyline, a statistical framework to predict tissue-specific functional regions in the human genome, and demonstrate its ability to capture tissue-specific functionality through extensive case studies. We then illustrate a variety of ways that GenoSkyline could benefit post-GWAS analysis. The performance of signal prioritization is further improved using annotations of disease-related tissue types. Furthermore, combining GenoSkyline annotations with GWAS results allow us to partition heritability by tissue types and generate new hypotheses regarding the disease etiology behind each risk locus, thereby providing novel biological insights to many human complex diseases. GenoSkyline is powerful, robust, and customizable. We believe that GenoSkyline and its applications can guide genetics research at multiple resolutions and greatly benefit the broader scientific community."

In multicellular organisms, cell types have distinct patterns of gene expression, and these patterns are controlled by by the expression of cell-type-specific transcription factors and by modulating chromatin structure. The Polycomb system is one major system for the chromatin-mediated silencing of developmental gene expression, where a histone methyltransferase marks extended chromatin domains with trimethylation of lysine-27 of the histone H3 tail (H3K27me3) and forms repressed chromatin. In Drosophila, repressive regulatory elements called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are thought to nucleate histone methyltransferase binding which then spreads across these domains. In this study, we demonstrate that two PREs near the developmental vestigial gene have distinct and separable effects on gene activation and chromatin structure. Both PREs are functional repressors in transgenes, but the PRE located near the vestigial promoter is required for gene transcription. This PRE has no effect on histone methylation of the domain. The second PRE located in the middle of the chromatin domain is required for high-level H3K27me3 of the domain, but this methylation is not required to refine vestigial gene expression. Significant chromatin methylation remains when both PREs are deleted. Our findings imply that PREs near promoters may play activating roles in gene expression in the Drosophila genome. We suggest that some domains of H3K27me3 may have little consequence for correctly patterning gene expression."

This organophosphate insecticide has been in use for over 50 years and resistance to this chemical has been reported in Aedes aegypti populations from Latin America, the Caribbean and from Asia. In other insect species, organophosphate resistance is typically associated with mutations in the target site, acetylcholinesterase, that decrease the insect's sensitivity to the insecticide, or increases in the activity of one or more carboxylesterase enzymes, either by overproduction and/or amino acid substitutions, that reduce the amount of insecticide reaching the target site. Neither of these mechanisms has been previously characterised at the molecular level in dengue vectors. Here we identify an Ae aegypti carboxylesterase gene with expression levels and amino acid sequence polymorphisms correlating with temephos resistance in Thailand. This is a key step in the development of tools to manage resistance in this mosquito species."

Currently, the factors that contribute to liver disease during HIV infection are not known, as human studies are difficult to conduct. Therefore, pathogenic SIV infection of macaques is a valuable model system for understanding immune changes that occur in tissues during infection, including the liver. Using liver samples from uninfected and SIV-infected macaques, we observed an increase in liver macrophage infiltration that was likely mediated by the macrophage-attracting chemokine, CCL2. Importantly, liver macrophage number strongly correlated with liver SIV levels and the expression of liver inflammatory and fibrosis mediators during SIV infection. Further, we identified an upregulation of immune and inflammatory pathways in the liver of SIV-infected macaques, including a strong antiviral response. Treatment with antiretroviral drugs decreased macrophage infiltration and reduced liver inflammation, consistent with reduced SIV levels. In summary, these findings provide mechanistic insights into how SIV infection promotes liver inflammation through macrophage infiltration, which can predispose this population to liver complications during infection."

Experimental determination of structures is costly and lengthy. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners are available and constantly improving. Such methods generate a large number of diverse conformations and rank them for their likelihood to be correct. Even a model very similar to the correct structure is rarely the top-scoring one, but, as in the examples presented here, only within the top ~10–100 (the exact number depends on the complexity of the structure, and could be much higher). Here we show through atomistic simulation that good models are kinetically stable and bad models most often are not. More surprisingly, we also see that some bad models spontaneously find the correct (i.e., experimentally determined) conformation. This is remarkable, and could become an additional tool to contribute to structure determination of protein complexes. Such a result can also be expected, because evolution sculpted the free energy landscape in a way that the biologically active state is not only the one of lowest free energy (i.e., the most likely state) but also robustly reachable and kinetically stable (i.e., at the bottom of a funnel on the free energy landscape)."

Thus, network properties that are relevant in the context of brain function may be important for telecommunication networks in general. Here we show how neural activity can be partitioned into units of information and analyzed from the perspective of a telecommunication system. We demonstrate that the inter-departure times of such units of information have very similar probability distributions across subjects and that they are sensitive both to regional variation and cognitive state. The approach we describe can be applied in a wide variety of experimental paradigms to generate novel indices of neural activity and open new avenues for network analysis of the brain."

The only shelterin subunit known to promote telomerase function is TPP1, which mediates telomerase recruitment to telomeres and stimulates telomerase processivity. Mutations in shelterin components cause Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) and related disease syndromes due to the inability to maintain telomere homeostasis. In this study, we have identified TIN2-R282H, the most common DC-causing mutation in shelterin subunit TIN2, as a separation-of-function mutant which impairs telomerase recruitment to telomeres, but not chromosome end protection. The telomerase recruitment defect conferred by TIN2-R282H is likely through a mechanism independent of TIN2’s role in anchoring TPP1 at telomeres, since TPP1 localization to telomeres is unaffected by the mutation."

The average human genome contains about 100 active L1s that mobilize throughout the genome by a “copy and paste” process termed retrotransposition. Active L1s encode two proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p). ORF1p and ORF2p preferentially bind to their encoding RNA, forming a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP). During retrotransposition, the L1 RNP translocates to the nucleus, where the ORF2p endonuclease makes a single-strand nick in target site DNA that exposes a 3′ hydroxyl group in genomic DNA. The 3′ hydroxyl group then is used as a primer by the ORF2p reverse transcriptase to copy the L1 RNA into cDNA, leading to the integration of an L1 copy at a new genomic location. The evolutionary success of L1 requires the faithful retrotransposition of full-length L1 mRNAs; thus, it was surprising to find that a small number of L1 retrotransposition events are derived from spliced L1 mRNAs. By using genetic, biochemical, and computational approaches, we demonstrate that spliced L1 mRNAs can undergo an initial round of retrotransposition, leading to the generation of spliced integrated retrotransposed elements (SpIREs). SpIREs represent about 2% of previously annotated full-length primate-specific L1s in the human genome reference sequence. However, because splicing leads to intra-L1 deletions that remove critical sequences required for L1 expression, SpIREs generally cannot undergo subsequent rounds of retrotransposition and can be considered “dead on arrival” insertions. Our data further highlight how genetic conflict between L1 and its host has influenced L1 expression, L1 retrotransposition, and L1 splicing dynamics over evolutionary time."

Male mice carrying a point mutation in the p80 gene are sterile as a consequence of low numbers of sperm, abnormal sperm morphology, and poor motility (ability to “swim”).

This study is the first to show that katanin p80, via its effects on microtubule dynamics within the testis, is required for male fertility."

The 5′ strand of a DSB can be nucleolytically degraded by several nucleases and associated factors, including Mre11, CtIP/Sae2, Exo1 and Dna2 together with Bloom helicase/Sgs1, through a finely regulated process called DSB resection. Once resection is initiated, error-prone NHEJ is prevented. Several findings suggest that DSB resection is a double-edged sword, if not finely regulated, since on one hand it is needed for faithful HR, but on the other it may lead to extensive DNA deletions associated with genome instability. Both in mammals and yeast, 53BP1/Rad9 protein binds near the lesion and counteracts the resection process, limiting the formation of ssDNA. By using S. cerevisiae as a model organism, here we show that Rad9 oligomers block the removal of hypo-active Mre11 protein from a persistent DSB, thus limiting initiation of resection and the recruitment of the recombination factor Rad52, in the absence of Sae2. Altogether, these findings pinpoint a critical role of 53BP1/Rad9 in balancing HR and NHEJ repair events throughout the cell cycle."

A number of genes in the simple eukaryote brewer's yeast are “recruited” to the nuclear periphery through interactions with the nuclear pore complex when they are expressed. The functional significance of peripheral recruitment is unclear.Here, we show that recruited genes are actively retained at the periphery for generations after transcription is repressed. This suggests that localization at the nuclear periphery represents a novel inherited state that might allow simple eukaryotic organisms to “remember” previous transcriptional activation. This type of memory allows for more robust reactivation of genes, suggesting that it is adaptive. Finally, both retention at the nuclear periphery and rapid reactivation require a variant form of histone H2A.Adaptive memory is distinct from other types of transcriptional memory. In developmental memory, transcriptional states established by transcriptional regulators early in embryogenesis are propagated long after these regulators have disappeared.

This observation raises the possibility that immune factors in infected women play a role in limiting HIV-1 transmission. Identifying factors associated with reduced HIV-1 transmission risk will improve our understanding on the potential correlates of protection that should be the focus of generating effective immunogens and vaccination protocols. Here we assessed the functional role of breast milk antibodies in a group of women with high plasma viral loads and systemic NAbs and determined that overall, breast milk contains low levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to plasma. In contrast, we observed a robust non-neutralizing activity in breast milk that was associated with infant infection status. Our study adds to the growing evidence of a potential role of non-neutralizing antibodies in limiting HIV-1 transmission and calls for more attention to this arm of the HIV-1 response."

In this study, we report the height and weight of children enrolled in a trial in Ethiopia in which communities were randomized either to twice annual mass azithromycin distributions for blinding trachoma or to no treatments. After accounting for age and sex, children from azithromycin-treated communities were on average slightly taller at the 12- and 36-month study visits than those from untreated communities, but the difference was not statistically significant."

TGFβs are potent inducers of cartilage formation, but the mechanisms by which they transduce their signals in cartilage during development are poorly understood. Similarly, there is strong evidence that dysregulation of the TGFβ pathway increases the risk for osteoarthritis (OA) in humans, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. TGFβs transduce their signals through a canonical pathway involving Smad2 and Smad3, and through several non-canonical pathways. However, the roles of canonical vs. noncanonical signaling are unknown in cartilage because the combined roles of Smad2 and Smad3 have not been determined. We generated mice lacking both Smad2 and Smad3 in cartilage in order to determine the role of canonical TGFβ signaling during embryonic development. We determined that Smad2 has a more prominent role than Smad3 in non-hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, and identified elevated levels of Ihh RNA in neonatal cartilage in Smad2 and Smad3 mutants. These findings may be important because Ihh is a vital regulator of cartilage proliferation and differentiation during cartilage development. More generally, the studies identify how Smad2 and Smad3 can regulate a common target gene through distinct mechanisms."

Three different Oesophagostomum species were identified in the primates studied and we confirmed the existence of a recently described clade in baboons. Because the Sebitoli chimpanzees displayed a high prevalence of infection and because a high spatiotemporal overlap between humans and apes occurred in our study area, the risk of transmission of O. stephanostomum between the two species cannot be neglected. Thus, our results add to our understanding of nodular worm infection in location where non human primates and humans are co-existing, and underline the necessity to conduct further research at a local scale in a public health concern."

However, existing methods of analysis cannot uniquely describe cell behavior and suffer from various limitations. This complicates efforts to address questions such as to what extent chemotactic signals direct cellular behaviors and how random migration of many cells leads to coordinated immune response. We therefore develop methods that provide a complete description of migration with a minimum of assumptions and describe specific quantities for characterizing directional motion. Using numerical simulations and experimental data, we evaluate these measures and discuss methods to minimize the effects of experimental artifacts. These methodologies may be applied to various migrating cells or organisms. We apply our approach to an important model system, T cells migrating in lymph node. Surprisingly, we find that the canonical Brownian-walker-like model does not accurately describe migration. Instead, we find that T cells move heterogeneously and are described by a two-population model of persistent and diffusive random walkers. This model is completely different from the generalized Lévy walk model that describes activated T cells in brains infected with Toxoplasma gondii, indicating that T cells exhibit distinct migration statistics in different tissues."

Globally, 68 million are infected, with ~36 million people disfigured and disabled by complications such as severe swelling of the legs (elephantiasis) or scrotum (hydrocele). The Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF) aims to interrupt disease transmission through mass drug administration (MDA), and to control illness and suffering in affected persons by 2020. The World Health Organization recommends conducting Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) in school children aged 6–7 years, to determine if infection rates have dropped to levels where disease transmission is no longer sustainable. American Samoa made significant progress towards eliminating LF. Following seven rounds of MDA, American Samoa passed TAS in 2011–2012 and 2015, with antigen prevalence of <1%. Despite passing TAS, recent studies have provided evidence of ongoing disease transmission in American Samoa, questioning the suitability of TAS for conducting surveillance after MDA has stopped. We compared a school-based survey of children aged 6–7 years and a community-based survey targeting people aged ≥8 years as tools for conducting post-MDA surveillance of LF. Our study provides recommendations for strengthening of post-MDA surveillance as countries approach the GPELF elimination targets."

In this study, we discovered a novel phenomenon of transcriptional antagonism exerted via two isoforms encoded from the same gene. Balanced expression of the two forms was necessary for ensuring normal immune gene expression and maintaining immunological homeostasis in the Drosophila gut. We performed genetic manipulations to skew the balance of these isoforms. This resulted in a dysregulated immune system, changed levels of gut bacteria and altered host lifespan. Moreover, when we overexpressed the activating form flies quickly succumbed to oral bacterial infection despite an enhanced immune response. We suggest that antagonistically acting transcription factor isoforms may constitute a general mechanism for adjusting gene expression in various biological processes."

Its ability to quickly adapt to diverse environments and to form biofilms poses a significant challenge to the medical community. Neutrophil granulocytes, professional phagocytes found cruising through the body’s circulatory system and tissues, provide the most efficient immune response against P. aeruginosa. Neutrophils utilize multiple strategies to eliminate bacteria. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a DNA-based scaffold with attached antimicrobial proteins, provides an efficient mechanism to trap P. aeruginosa. The detailed mechanism of NET release induced by bacteria remains unclear. Our data show that the flagellum, the organelle that provides swimming motility to P. aeruginosa, is the main factor required to induce NET release. Our novel findings indicate that the flagellum, and in particular swimming motility, mediates P. aeruginosa-induced NET extrusion independently of the well-characterized flagellin receptors. The novel data presented here also suggest that down-regulation of flagellar motility characteristically seen in P. aeruginosa lung infections in cystic fibrosis is relevant for P. aeruginosa to avoid neutrophil attacks."

Organisms that express these diversification systems are under strong evolutionary pressure to provide subpopulations of preexisting variants and often rely on cellular recombination machinery to catalyze dedicated high-frequency reactions without disturbing genome integrity. Previously, we defined a guanine quartet (G4) structure in the strict human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae that is required for initiating the homologous recombination reactions leading to pilin antigenic variation (Av). G4 structures have been implicated in many biological processes, however the mechanisms allowing their formation within a chromosome have not been elucidated. In this work, we show a direct link between transcription of a small RNA (sRNA) that initiates within the G4 structure forming sequence and pilin Av and conclude that the process of transcription is necessary for G4 structure formation. sRNAs have emerged as important regulatory molecules in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and this is a novel activity of a sRNA in a bacterium. We anticipate that the reliance of G4 structure formation on transcription is a mechanism used by other biological systems that rely on this alternative DNA structure."

In this work, using motor activity as the observed response, a statistical framework is developed for such study, and a quantitative relationship between parameter values and response is established. Within this framework, a possible correlate of arousal, the rapid onset of spatial (two-dimensional) movement, is uncovered and also studied. One long-term hope for techniques such as DBS are that they could assist in the treatment of disorders of consciousness, by supplementing or replacing (e.g., in Traumatic Brain Injury) what should ordinarily be the appropriate endogenous stimulation."

We compared the toxicity and antigenic profiles of the major C. difficile virulence factor, TcdB, from a previously studied reference strain and a BI/NAP1/027 strain. The results indicate TcdB027, the toxin from the BI/NAP1/027 strain, is more lethal and causes more extensive brain hemorrhaging than TcdB003, the toxin produced by a reference strain of C. difficile. Furthermore, the results show that the antigenic carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) encodes at least 11 epitopes that differ between the two forms of TcdB. In line with this, experiments demonstrate that antiserum against the CTD does not cross-neutralize TcdB003 and TcdB027 toxicity against CHO cells, and TcdB027 appears to be devoid of neutralizing epitopes in this domain.

Arrested trabecular development has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertrabeculation associated with ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy. However much uncertainty still exists among clinicians concerning the physiopathology of ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, including its clinical characteristics, prognosis, classification and even the definition of hypertrabeculation. In particular, distinguishing between pathological and non-pathological subtypes of non-compaction is currently a major issue. Here we show that deletion of the gene encoding the transcription factor Nkx2-5 at critical steps during trabecular development recapitulates pathological features of hypertrabeculation, providing the first model of ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy in adult mice. We demonstrate that excessive trabeculation due to failure of trabecular compaction during fetal development is associated with Purkinje fiber hypoplasia and subendocardial fibrosis. Longitudinal functional studies reveal that these mice present all the clinical signs of symptomatic left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, including conduction defects, strain defects and progressive heart failure. Our results, including transcriptomic analysis, suggest that pathological features of non-compaction are primarily developmental defects. This study clarifies the origin of the pathological outcomes associated with LVNC and may provide helpful information for clinicians concerning the etiology of this rare cardiomyopathy."

To fight STH, large-scale de-worming programs are implemented in which anthelmintic drugs (either albendazole (ABZ) or mebendazole (MEB)) are administered. However, there is a wide range of other brands, which are even more accessible, but for which the efficacy and quality remain poorly explored. We evaluated efficacy against STHs and quality of two ABZ brands commonly available on the local markets in Ethiopia (Bendex and Ovis). Both brands showed high efficacy against roundworm infections and poor efficacy against whipworms. However, for hookworm infections, Bendex was significantly less efficacious than Ovis. In terms of drug quality, a significant difference was observed in the dissolution profile, with Bendex having a significantly slower dissolution rate than Ovis. Since dissolution behavior is critical for a drug to be appropriately absorbed into the helminth (through host-blood and/or parasite-cuticle) and produce therapeutic efficacy, the poor dissolution of Bendex compared to Ovis can explain the observed difference in efficacy against hookworms. Our results emphasize the importance of periodically assessing of drug quality to ensure appropriate therapeutic efficacy and to exclude poor drug quality as a potential factor of reduced drug efficacy other than drug resistance."

To date, the drugs in use cannot kill the parasite E. multilocularis and they also induce side-effects, therefore new options for treatment are needed. We here screened a library of 400 compounds with proven activity against Plasmodium falciparum, the cause of malaria, for their effects against E. multilocularis in vitro. We developed and refined an in vitro screening cascade and developed an assay that can identify compounds with parasiticidal effects against E. multilocularis cells. We here show that MMV665807 acts parasiticidal as demonstrated by in vitro viability tests and by electron microscopy. In the mouse infection model the drug was not active, but work will focus on the evaluation of derivatives with improved bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties to achieve parasiticidal activity not only in vitro, but also in vivo."

Infection with B. recurrentis has been achieved only in humans and is accompanied by a systemic inflammatory disease, multiple relapses of fever and massive spirochetemia. A key virulence factor of B. recurrentis is their potential to undergo antigenic variation. However, for survival in the blood during the early phase of infection and for persistence in human tissues, spirochetes must be endowed with robust tools to escape innate immunity. We have recently shown that B. recurrentis acquires the serum-derived regulator factor H, thereby blocking the alternative complement pathway. Here, we show that B. recurrentis expresses in addition a novel outer surface lipoprotein that selectively binds serum-derived C4b-binding protein and C1 esterase inhibitor, two endogenous regulators of the classical and lectin pathway of complement activation. The combined data underscore the versatility of B. recurrentis to effectively evade innate and adaptive immunity, including serum resistance. Thus, the present study elucidates a new mechanism of B. recurrentis important for its evasion from complement attack and will be helpful for the development of new drugs against this fatal infection."

Since 2008, outbreaks of the disease have occurred in regions of the country where no reports had been registered for decades, which has obligated public health authorities to redefine risk areas for the disease. The aim of the present study was to propose a methodology of environmental risk analysis for defining priority municipalities for YF vaccination. The municipalities were divided into two groups (affected and unaffected by YF) and compared based on environmental parameters related to the disease's epidemiology. Statistical analysis was used to identify associations between the variables and virus circulation, as well as, to evaluate the relationship among the variables and their contribution to the dynamics of YF. The MCA generated a factor that was able to differentiate between affected and unaffected municipalities and was used to determine risk levels. This methodology can be replicated in other regions, standardized, and adapted to each context."

To better understand the physiological responses to impaired protein synthesis, we characterize a novel developmental arrest state that occurs when reducing protein synthesis during C. elegans development. Arrested animals have multiple survival-promoting phenotypes that are all dependent on the cellular energy sensor, AMP kinase. This survival response acts through the hypodermis and causes a reduction in pharyngeal pumping, indicating that the animal is responding to a perceived external threat, even in adults. Furthermore, exposing animals to pathogens, or xenobiotics they produce, can recapitulate these phenotypes, providing a potential evolutionary explanation for how a beneficial response in adults could evolve through the inhibition of an essential biological process such as protein synthesis."

It is caused by sand fleas (also called jigger fleas) which burrow in the skin of humans and animals. Tungiasis can cause physical disabilities and the associated wounds facilitate entry of pathogens including those causing tetanus. In Brazil, presence of tungiasis in animals increased the risk and severity of the human disease. Until now, no systematic studies on animal tungiasis in Africa have been conducted. Therefore, an epidemiological study was performed in Busoga sub-region, where tungiasis in humans is very common. Tungiasis was detected in pigs, dogs, goats and a cat, respectively, in their order of significance. Animal tungiasis was strongly associated with human tungiasis and the presence of the disease in animals increased the risk of human infection by a factor of six. Our findings confirmed, for the first time, a strong correlation between the presence of tungiasis in animal reservoirs and the human population in Africa. Therefore, control of tungiasis in animals should be integrated in all interventions geared at controlling tungiasis in endemic communities."

TconTS1 and TconTS2 lectin domain bind to galactosyl as well as mannosyl glycans with different affinities as shown by glycan array analysis. Along this line, we have also demonstrated binding of TconTS-LD to high-mannose N-glycans on glycoproteins, which is competitively inhibited by the corresponding free high-mannose N-glycans, underlining the TconTS-LD substrate specificities. TconTS1 dimerisation is mediated by TconTS-LD binding to its N-glycans and enzymatic N-deglycosylation of TconTS leads to an increase of monomers. STD NMR results obtained indicate that oligo-mannosylated glycans bind to TconTS-LD to a different site than lactose. In summary, this is good evidence that the lectin domains of TconTS1 and TconTS2 play relevant roles modulating the biological functions of these and possibly other trans-sialidases. Further detailed analysis on TconTS-LD and its role in enzyme activity will lead to a better understanding and possibly to new strategies against Nagana in livestock."

Specifically, there are limited viral strains that have been characterized and available for laboratory study as well as limited knowledge of immune responses induced to the virus. In this study, we isolated CHIKV virus from an acutely infected human patient and used this new virus to develop a neutralization assay and a challenge stock, which is effective in a mouse model. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of an envelope-based synthetic DNA-based vaccine to impact viral disease in the mouse model and to generate protective levels of immune responses in nonhuman primates. We observed that this novel vaccine approach generated protective levels of immune responses in both mouse and non-human primate models. We believe that these studies advance the field of Chikungunya vaccine research as well as the study of immune protection to CHIKV."

B. xylophilus has acquired the ability to parasitise plants independently from other economically important nematodes and has a complex life cycle that includes fungal feeding and a stage associated with an insect, as well as plant parasitism. We have sequenced the genome of B. xylophilus and used it as a resource to understand disease mechanisms and the biological basis of its complex ecology. The ability to break down cellulose, the major component of the plant cell wall, is a major problem for plant parasitic nematodes as few animals can produce the required enzymes (cellulases). Previous work has shown that other plant parasitic nematodes have acquired cellulases from bacteria but we show that all Bursaphelenchus cellulases were most likely acquired independently from fungi. We also describe a complex set of genes encoding enzymes that can break down proteins and other molecules, perhaps reflecting the range of organisms with which B. xylophilus interacts during its life cycle. The genome sequence of Bursaphelenchus represents an important step forward in understanding its biology, and will contribute to efforts to control the devastating disease it causes."

In these diseases a misfolded form of host prion protein (PrP) leads to brain degeneration and death. The genetic code of PrP in individual animals or humans has minor variations, which in some cases are associated with altered susceptibility to disease. In humans a variation at residue 171 (N171S) has been found in people mainly of African descent. However, due to the low incidence of the variation and difficult accessibility of these individuals, studies of prion diseases in these populations have not been carried out. Therefore, to create a laboratory animal model to study the effect of this variation on prion diseases, we generated transgenic mice expressing the mouse version of the human PrP variation at residue 171. We then studied the susceptibility of these mice to 4 strains of mouse-adapted scrapie. In our experiments these transgenic mice were uniquely resistant to two scrapie strains, but showed high sensitivity to two others. This resistance appeared to be related to a slow or inefficient generation of the aggregated disease-associated form of PrP in these mice, and was not duplicated using in vitro assays. In summary, transgenic mice expressing this variant PrP provide an interesting model to study differences among prion strains and their interactions with PrP in vivo."

The most lethal outbreak of influenza known was the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 20 to 100 million people. The 1918 virus was likely introduced into the human population from birds. We previously described five human neutralizing antibodies from survivors of the 1918 pandemic that bind the hemagglutinin (HA) surface antigen. Here, we define the binding sites of antibodies 1F1 and 1I20 on the 1918 HA and demonstrate that these overlap with the glycan receptor binding site. The glycan specificity differs between human and avian viruses for the linkages of the sialylated sugar receptors [human (α2–6) or avian (α2–3)]. 1F1 and 1I20 binds viruses that contain HA residues that mediate preference for α2–6 sialylated sugars. Three other control antibodies were not affected by preferences for the linkages of the sialylated sugar receptors because they bind elsewhere. Since the receptor-binding site is relatively conserved, this may explain the cross-reactivity of 1F1 and the enhanced binding of 1F1 and 1I20 to HAs with human receptor specificity."

Circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain play a crucial role in timing of specific behaviors to the appropriate times of day. These neurons are further specialized to those primarily responsible for morning and evening behavior. We have used the fruit fly Drosophila as a simple model system to elucidate the neural circuits important for timed daily behavior. In flies, a small group of clock neurons devoted to morning behavior express a neuropeptide, PIGMENT DISPERSING FACTOR (PDF). Until now it was unclear what the direct neural targets of this peptide are and how its actions at those targets mediate timed behavior. Here we find that the so-called morning clock neurons communicate directly to other clock neurons, those responsible for evening behavior. This communication sustains high amplitude morning activity and sets the phase of evening activity as well as the period of activity rhythms in constant conditions. These studies reveal the circuit diagram for PDF function in circadian behavior."

The incidence of dog rabies remains unchanged, but the incidence of suspect human rabies is decreasing gradually in Sri Lanka. This finding indicates the effects of improved access to postexposure prophylaxis by animal bite victims and increased rabies awareness. As in other rabies-endemic countries, in Sri Lanka, human rabies is transmitted mainly by dogs, although domestic and wild animals have been diagnosed rabid, and can pose a risk of exposure to humans. In this study, we analyzed 12 years of data accumulated in the national reference laboratory of Sri Lanka to identify the trends of rabies in this country. This study showed that rabies has been recorded mainly in Western and Southern Provinces of Sri Lanka, possibly because of the ease of communication with rabies diagnostic laboratories from these areas. Regional rabies diagnosis laboratories should be established to improve surveillance of rabies in Sri Lanka. There were few submitted animal samples from livestock and wild animals, indicating that greater awareness is needed among the public regarding the need to submit suspect rabid animals for diagnostic evaluation. These data could help policy makers improve rabies prevention and to control rabies in Sri Lanka."

Long-term potentiation (LTP), an enduring increase in the strength of specific connections (synapses) between neurons, is thought to comprise, at least in part, the substrate of learning and memory. What processes transduce brief stimuli into persistent LTP? Persistent increased activity of an enzyme denoted protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Only synapses that have been “tagged” by a stimulus, such as stimuli needed for LTP and learning, can “capture” PKMζ. We developed a model simulating dynamics of key molecules required for LTP and its opposite, long-term depression (LTD). The model concisely represents relationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. It makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKMζ. The maintenance of LTP and memory is predicted to require positive feedback in which PKMζ enhances its own synthesis at potentiated synapses. Without synaptic capture of PKMζ, no positive feedback would occur. LTD induction is also predicted to increase PKMζ synthesis. The model also makes predictions about regulation of PKMζ synthesis. Experiments testing the above predictions would advance the understanding of memory maintenance."

However, previous genome-wide studies of a diverse array of organisms found only weak, negative correlations between the importance of a gene and its evolutionary rate. We show, here, that the weakness of the correlation is not because gene importance measured in lab conditions deviates from that in an organism's natural environments. Neither is it due to a potentially biased among-gene distribution of functional density. We suggest that the weakness of the correlation is factual, rather than artifactual. These findings notwithstanding, we show that the principle of slower evolution of more important genes does have some predictive power when genes with vastly different evolutionary rates are compared, explaining why the principle can be practically useful for tasks such as identifying functional non-coding sequences despite the weakness of the correlation."

Their activation is very effective following cell contacts with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. We investigated whether HIV-1 could regulate the antiviral responses of pDCs triggered upon sensing of infected cells. We show that HIV-1 suppresses the levels of IFN-I produced by pDCs through a process that requires expression of the Vpu accessory protein in virus-producing cells. A well-described role of Vpu is to promote efficient HIV-1 production by counteracting BST2, a host factor that entraps nascent viral particle at the cell surface. Apart from its antiviral activity, BST2 was reported to inhibit IFN-I production by pDCs through binding and activation of the ILT7 pDC-specific inhibitory receptor. Our results reveal that through a highly sophisticated targeted regulation of BST2 levels at the surface of infected cells, Vpu promotes HIV-1 release and limits IFN-I production by pDCs via the negative signaling exerted by the BST2-ILT7 pair. Overall, this study sheds light on a novel Vpu-BST2 interaction that allows HIV-1 to escape pDC antiviral responses. This modulation of pDC antiviral response by HIV Vpu may facilitate the initial viral expansion during acute infection."

Some sera were able to neutralize heterologous isolates, provided that a key, regulating glycan was removed. Overall, these findings suggest that native, membrane-expressed trimers hold promise for further development as vaccine candidates. In the future, by adapting our current findings, we might be able to encourage nAb development to key conserved sites by introducing additional, targeted gaps in the trimer's glycan shell.

Susceptibility to venous thrombosis is governed by both genes and environment, with approximately 60% of the risk attributed to genetic influences. Though several genetic risk factors are known, >50% of genetic risk remains unexplained. Approximately 5% of people carry the most common known risk factor, Factor V Leiden. However, only 10% of these individuals will develop a blood clot in their lifetime. Mice carrying two copies of the Factor V Leiden mutation together with a mutation in a second gene called tissue factor pathway inhibitor develop fatal thrombosis shortly after birth. To identify genes that prevent this fatal thrombosis, we studied a large panel of mice carrying inactivating gene changes randomly distributed throughout the genome. We identified several genes as potential candidates to alter blood clotting balance in mice and humans with predisposition to thrombosis, and confirmed this protective function for DNA changes in one of these genes (Plcb4)."

Host genetic determinants influence the outcome of S. aureus infection, yet are poorly understood. Susceptible A/J and resistant C57BL/6J mice provide a unique platform to study the genetic difference responsible for variable host response to S. aureus infection. We showed that chromosome 11 in A/J was responsible for susceptibility to S. aureus. We further identified a QTL locus on Chromosome 11 significantly associated with S. aureus susceptibility. Five genes in the QTL (Dcaf7, Dusp3, Fam134c, Psme3, and Slc4a1) were significantly differently expressed in a) susceptible vs. resistant mice, and b) humans with S. aureus blood stream infection vs. healthy human subjects. Three genes (Dusp3, Psme3, and Dcaf7) were down-regulated in susceptible A/J mice. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Dusp3 and Psme3 in bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDMs) significantly enhanced cytokine responses through NF-κB activity upon S. aureus challenge in a pattern that was also present in S. aureus-challenged BMDMs from susceptible CSS11 (chr. 11 from A/J but otherwise C57BL/6J) mice, but not resistant C57BL/6J mice.

Adenosine serves signal “ selfish ” immune cells send infection secure energy expense tissues .","The immune response is energetically costly and often requires adaption of the whole organism to ensure it receives enough energy. It is not well understood how distribution of energy resources within the organism is regulated during an immune response. To understand this better, we used parasitoid wasp infection of fruit fly larvae—the host larvae have 48 h before they pupate to destroy the infecting “alien” or face destruction by the parasitoid that will consume the developing pupa. Here we find a signal, generated by the host immune cells, which mediates a systemic energy switch. This signal—adenosine—suppresses processes driving larval to pupal development of the host, thereby freeing up energy for the immune system. We show that the resulting developmental delay in the fruit fly larvae is crucial for an efficient immune response; without the adenosine signal, resistance to the parasitoid drops drastically. Generation of this signal by immune cells demonstrates that in response to external stressors, the immune system can mobilize reallocation to itself of energy and nutrients from the rest of the organism."

Model systems of human heart failure are necessary to facilitate the screening and identification of genes and genetic variations that either cause or influence the development and progression of this disease. To better understand these genes, we conducted a genetic screen employing molecularly defined deletions throughout the genome of the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We used an optical coherence tomography imaging technique that provided images similar to echocardiography in humans to measure the cardiac function in adult flies. We identified mutants in members of the rhomboid protease family and epidermal growth factor receptor that cause an enlarged cardiac chamber. Interestingly, abnormalities in the function of members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family in humans that undergo certain chemotherapies are associated with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Our results suggest that epidermal growth factor receptor signaling may be an evolutionarily conserved pathway that is necessary to maintain normal adult cardiac function."

Latently infected T cells do not produce significant amounts of viral genomes or viral proteins due to the silencing of a specific step in the viral life cycle called transcription. Viral transcription can be reactivated in latently infected cells, a process that rekindles HIV infection after antiretroviral therapy is discontinued. A key regulator of viral transcription is the viral Tat protein. Here we identify a novel cellular enzyme that regulates HIV transcription through the modification of the Tat protein. This enzyme, LSD1, is generally known as a transcriptional suppressor. In HIV infection, however, it acts as a transcriptional activator because downregulation of LSD1 expression or inhibition of its enzymatic activity suppresses reactivation of HIV from latency. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms of HIV latency and identify a potential new strategy that may help to keep HIV dormant in latently infected cells."

Although this tumor etiology has been intensively investigated in the well-established Ptch1+/− mouse model, knowledge is still lacking about the molecular interactions between neoplastic transformation and other developmental processes. Nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to be involved in controlling proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Therefore, inactivation of the NO–producing enzyme Nos2 in combination with the mutated Ptch1 gene should provide insight into how developmental regulation influences pathogenesis. Here, we describe a new role for NO in developing neuronal precursors of the cerebellum facilitating physiologically accurate migration via regulation of Gap43. We further demonstrate that disturbance of these processes leads to retention of granule precursor cells to the cerebellar periphery. Together with the sustained proliferation of these cells in combined Ptch1+/− Nos2−/− mice, this effect results in an increased medulloblastoma incidence relative to Ptch1+/− mice and demonstrates a new disease-promoting mechanism in this tumor entity."

Understanding the biological functions of the virus is crucial to the development of a vaccine and to improve current therapy through development of directly-acting antiviral compounds. The NS5A protein is a promising antiviral target, but much remains to be understood about its role in the viral life cycle. Great diversity among the seven major HCV genotypes poses challenges for broadly active inhibitors. Here we used infectious cell culture systems for NS5A of the seven major HCV genotypes, and demonstrated that all genotypes depended on the NS5A amphipathic alpha-helix, domain I, low-complexity sequence (LCS) I and domain II for viral replication. Interestingly, effects on replication and virus production by changes in LCSII and domain III varied greatly among NS5A isolates. Furthermore, we found that genotype 2 had evolved genotype-specific residues in domain I of importance for viral function. Thus, the highly diverse sequence of the NS5A protein reflected functional differences between HCV genotypes and isolates. Such differences will be important to consider in understanding HCV biology and for future development of antiviral compounds."

But collecting better information can result in less efficient movement: Bicycling while standing up on the pedals may help you see over obstacles ahead of you, but it causes more air drag, forcing your legs to work harder. Nocturnal weakly electric fish search for prey with their body tilted. This tilting more than doubles the resistance to movement from the water, but because the fish's ability to sense prey improves when tilted, it is better to swim this way. Beyond a certain amount of tilt, the costs of movement become too great. Interestingly, the benefit of tilting is dependent on the shape of the volume around the fish where it detects prey. We also found that if the fish was able to swivel its region of prey sensitivity, like a vision-based animal can shift its gaze, it would save energy. This conclusion helps us understand why animals like us can move our eyes. A Polish folk saying succinctly captures the gist: “He who doesn't have it in the head has it in the legs” (Ten kto nie ma w głowie ma w nogach)."

A wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic bacteremia can potentially lead to a spread of the disease into non-endemic regions. The PCR-based approach is sensitive for detection of B. bacilliformis but requires a thermocycler, thus limiting its use in remote endemic areas. LAMP is a simple method capable of detecting B. bacilliformis DNA within an hour under isothermal conditions, requiring less specialized equipment for amplification, thus enabling diagnosis in rural areas. This study demonstrated that the detection limit of LAMP, targeting the pap31 gene of B. bacilliformis, was comparable to that of qPCR. With a high, targeted selectivity, LAMP showed a high specificity as no cross-reaction was observed when testing a panel of closely related bacteria. The utility of the LAMP assay was further demonstrated by the examination of sand flies artificially fed on blood spiked with B. bacilliformis. The results showed that LAMP was able to detect B. bacilliformis in all flies confirmed positive by qPCR. This study showed that LAMP can be useful to support diagnosis of patients in low-resource settings and also to identify B. bacilliformis in the sand fly vector."

Upon erythrophagocytosis of RBCs, the hemoglobin is degraded and heme is imported from the phagosomal compartment into the cytoplasm so that the iron can be released from heme. Defects in these pathways can lead to aberrant iron homeostasis. The Heme Responsive Gene-1 (HRG1, SLC48A1) was identified previously as a heme importer in the intestine of the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. In cell culture studies, HRG1 was demonstrated to mobilize heme from the erythrophagosome of mouse macrophages into the cytosol. However, the in vivo function of HRG1 remains to be elucidated. The zebrafish is a powerful genetic animal model for studying vertebrate development and ontogeny of hematopoiesis. In zebrafish, the kidney marrow is the adult hematopoietic organ that is functionally analogous to the mammalian bone marrow. In this study, we show that Hrg1 plays an essential in vivo role in recycling of damaged RBCs, and that the kidney macrophages are primarily responsible for recycling heme-iron in the adult zebrafish."

Heterochromatin is a condensed chromatin structure and involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression through repression of transcription. Heterochromatin at the pericentromeric repeats in fission yeast is assembled by two distinct mechanisms, RNAi-dependent and Rrp6, a component of the nuclear exosome, -dependent mechanisms. In addition, heterochromatin spreads into neighboring regions in an RNAi-dependent manner. Both mechanisms are coupled with the transcription from the target loci by RNA polymerase II, but the molecular nature of the coupling is not understood. Here we showed that the multi-subunit complex Mediator, which directs initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, functions in the coupling between transcription and heterochromatin assembly. Mediator is required for Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin assembly and contributes to the RNAi-dependent spreading of heterochromatin via enhancement of production of siRNA by RNAi machinery. These observations highlight the multi-functions of Mediator in the transcription-coupled processes."

The pathogenesis of fetal growth restriction in placental malaria is largely unknown, but in other pathological pregnancies, impaired transplacental amino acid transport has been implicated. In a cohort of Malawian women and their infants, we found that placental malaria, especially when associated with local inflammation, was associated with decreased expression and activity of an important group of amino acid placental transporters. Using an in vitro model of placental malaria with local inflammation, we discovered that maternal monocyte products could impair the activity of amino acid transporters on placental cells. Amino acid concentrations in paired maternal and cord plasmas revealed specific alterations of amino acid transport by placental malaria, especially with local inflammation. Overall, our data suggest that, more than malaria infection per se, the local inflammation it triggers compromises placental amino acid transport function, leading to fetal growth restriction. Greater understanding of the mechanisms involved, combined with interventions to improve fetal growth in malaria, are important priorities in areas of the world where the co-existence of malaria and maternal malnutrition threatens the health and lives of millions of young babies."

The Y-linked sex determining gene SRY regulates this process by initiating a pathway of gene and protein expression, including the expression of critical autosomal genes such as SOX9. We identified a mouse mutant that causes embryonic gonadal sex reversal: the development of ovaries in an XY embryo. This mutant, which we called boygirl (byg), was shown to contain an early stop codon that disrupts the autosomal gene encoding MAP3K4, a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Analysis of embryonic XY gonads suggests that sex reversal is caused by delayed and reduced expression of the sex-determining gene SRY. Our data indicate, for the first time, a requirement for MAPK signaling in the developing XY gonad in order to facilitate normal expression of SRY and the downstream testis-determining genes and also suggest that reduced dosage of MAP3K4 may be the cause of a previously described autosomal sex-reversing mutation in the mouse. We predict that loss of MAP3K4 or other MAPK components may underlie disorders of sexual development (DSD) in humans as well."

In a hybrid syndrome, called metachondromatosis (MC), patients develop tumors both on and within bones. Only the genes causing MO are known. Since MC is inherited, we studied genetic markers in an affected family and found a region of the genome, encompassing 100 genes, always passed on to affected members. Using a recently developed method, we captured and sequenced all 100 genes in multiple families and found mutations in one gene, PTPN11, in 11 of 17 families. Patients with MC have one mutant copy of PTPN11 from their affected parent and one normal copy from their unaffected parent in all cells. We found that the normal copy is additionally lost in cartilage cells that form tumors, giving rise to cells without PTPN11. Mutations in PTPN11 were not found in other cartilage tumor syndromes, including Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome. We are currently working to understand how loss of PTPN11 in cartilage cells causes tumors to form."

Translational selection i.e., selection for the codon adaptation to the tRNA pools, is one of the driving forces of codon bias. In the virus world, this implies an adjustment of the virus codon usage to that of the host cell. Hepatitis A virus appears as an exception to the rule, with a highly deoptimized codon usage, suggesting that translational selection is not the underlying mechanism of its codon bias. However, since the virus lacks a mechanism of cellular protein synthesis inhibition, the deoptimized codon usage may be envisaged as a hawk (cell) and dove (hepatitis A virus) competition strategy for tRNAs and translational selection as well. To confirm this possibility, we artificially induced cell protein synthesis shut-off, thus increasing the tRNA pool availability for the virus, and we took advantage of the quasispecies dynamics to elucidate changes in its codon usage. Virus adaptation to the drug results in a re-deoptimization of codon usage in the capsid region, suggesting a requirement of a slow translation rate, i.e., a translation kinetic selection, instead of a translational selection associated with an optimization of the codon usage.

We used experimental evolution to study the initial steps of the adaptation of Escherichia coli to cells of the innate immune system, i.e., macrophages. Our results demonstrate that bacteria can evolve remarkably fast, and acquire adaptations increasing survival inside macrophages and/or ability to escape engulfment. The mechanism underlying this pathoadaptive process involves the accumulation of mutations caused by transposon insertions, increasing pathogenicity in vivo. These findings reveal the remarkable fast pace at which bacteria can evolve to escape a central component of the host innate immunity, namely macrophages."

We wanted to ascertain whether a preventive chemotherapy approach, involving the large-scale distribution of triclabendazole within endemic communities, would be feasible for controlling morbidity associated with this disease. Consequently, we implemented a pilot intervention among schoolchildren in a community near Lake Titicaca and assessed this intervention's safety (by evaluating the occurrence of adverse events following treatment) and its efficacy (by measuring changes in prevalence and intensity of infection). Adverse events on treatment day, and one week and one month later were infrequent and mild, and no serious adverse events were reported. We observed cure rates of 77.8% after one treatment and 97.8% after two treatments, egg reduction rates of 74–90.3% after one treatment and 84.2–99.9% after two treatments, and a decrease in the proportion of high-intensity infections (≥400 epg) from 7.8% to 1.1% after one treatment and to 0% after two treatments. We conclude that administration of triclabendazole is a safe and efficacious public health intervention for control of fascioliasis in an endemic community in the Bolivian Altiplano. Preventive chemotherapy with triclabendazole, without individual-level diagnosis and treatment, appears therefore as a feasible option. However, further investigation is needed to define the most appropriate frequency of treatment."

This protein is involved in an adaptive response involving a growth transition in stress-tolerant bacteria, from growing as individual cells to forming non-separating branched cell aggregates. We demonstrate that the protein can self-assemble into large networks, consistent with its role as a morphogenetic protein, this assembly process being promoted by a metabolic product of the enzyme. Depletion of either this metabolite or the morphogenetic protein results in the inability of the bacteria to grow as individual cells in conditions of low osmolarity."

These nearly-universal features include exact adaptation-the ability to ignore prolonged input stimuli and return to basal activity, and fold-change detection- response to relative changes in input, not absolute changes. Together with information on the input-output relationship-e.g. is it a logarithmic or a power law relationship-we show that these conditions provide enough constraints to allow the researcher to reject certain circuit designs; it also predicts, if one assumes a given design, one of its key parameters.

If repaired inappropriately, such DNA breaks lead to genomic rearrangements, mutations, and ultimately cancer. Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is the major pathway for repairing double-stranded breaks in mammals. Errors associated with NHEJ have been implicated in the aging process because mice with mutations in NHEJ genes exhibit premature aging. It remains unknown, however, whether NHEJ becomes impaired during normal aging. Studies of age-related changes in NHEJ have been hampered by the lack of a mouse model that would allow detection and quantification of NHEJ events. Here we report generation of NHEJ reporter mice containing a GFP-based NHEJ cassette knocked-into the ROSA26 locus. Using this mouse model, we were able to compare NHEJ across different tissues and demonstrate that NHEJ becomes less efficient and more error-prone with age. Our results provide a mechanism for age-related genomic instability and increased cancer incidence with age. The NHEJ reporter mice will be useful for a broad range of studies in the fields of aging and DNA repair."

CanL was first identified within the US in hunting dogs 1980 and then again in 1999 when a large outbreak in a kennel in New York occurred. As the US is usually not considered a tropical country, there was much debate about how this neglected, vector borne, tropical disease had made its way into these dogs. We found that within the U.S. hunting dog population CanL is transmitted from mom to pup with no reported sand fly transmission in the population, despite multiple attempts to find infected sand flies associated with these dogs. While vertical transmission of this disease has been reported in case reports around the globe, risk factors associated with this unique means of Leishmania transmission are not known. Furthermore, the basic reproductive number, (R0), or number of new infections that one infected animal can cause has not been reported for vertical transmission of L. infantum. It is important to know the R0 as it helps identify how infectious a route of transmission can be and therefore how easy it might be to control this infection. A cohort of 124 dogs from 18 dams was analyzed from 1999 to 2016 for factors related to vertical transmission. Offspring from dams ever diagnostically positive for infection with L. infantum were 13.84x more likely to become positive for L. infantum themselves within their lifetime (RR: 13.84 95% CI: 3.54–54.20 p-value: <0.0001). The basic reproductive number for vertically transmitted L. infantum within this cohort was 4.12. These results underscore that an infected mom is highly likely to infect her offspring if treatment is not started to prevent transmission. There is a need for any public health prevention and control efforts to address vertical as well as vector transmission of canine leishmaniosis in endemic countries."

This trait is important for filamentous fungi, which are the main source of cellulases utilized to degrade lignocellulose to fermentable sugars. Penicillium oxalicum, which produces lignocellulolytic enzymes with more diverse components than Trichoderma reesei, has the capacity to secrete large amounts of cellulases. Meanwhile, cellulase expression is regulated by a complex network involved in many transcription factors in this organism. To better understand how cellulase genes are systematically regulated in P. oxalicum, we employed molecular genetics to uncover the cellulolytic transcription factors on a genome-wide scale. We discovered the synergistic and tunable regulation of cellulase expression by integrating cellulolytic regulators and their target genes, which refined our understanding of transcriptional-regulatory network as a “seesaw model” in which the coordinated regulation of cellulolytic genes is established by counteracting activators and repressors."

In our previous study, we showed that KSHV modulates host factors COX-2/PGE2 for its own advantage to promote its latent (persistent) infection. The premise that COX-2 is involved in growth and progression of several types of solid cancers and inflammation associated diseases has been well documented but has never been studied in KS. Here, utilizing COX-2 inhibition strategies, including chemical inhibition and a gene silencing approach, we systematically identified the potential role of KSHV induced COX-2/PGE2 in viral pathogenesis related events such as secretion of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines, MMPs and cell adhesion in de novo infected or latently infected endothelial cells. We report that COX-2/PGE2 inhibition down-regulates viral latent gene expression and survival of latently infected endothelial cells. The data emanating from our in vitro studies is valuable, informative and requires further examination using an in vitro angiogenic model and in vivo nude mice model to further validate COX-2 as a novel therapeutic to target latent infection and the associated diseases like KS."

In a number of settings disease is caused by the reactivation of a pre-existing quiescent infection of the host (latency) which, in the absence of a controlling immune response, is a major source of disease. Work to understand the switch from a latent to active (reactivated) infection has focussed on the regulation of the promoter that controls the major viral gene products IE72 and IE86 – an important first step towards HCMV reactivation. In this study we have correlated the activation of cellular signalling pathways with the downstream activation of this promoter. Specifically, the activation of cellular kinase in an ERK-MAPK dependent manner which displays an affinity for a protein bound to a key viral promoter drives a change in the chromatin architecture that allows viral gene expression – releasing the virus from the latent state."

We call these aggregations stress granules (SGs), and they can be marked by components such as TIA-1. SGs are always considered to be antiviral structures during viral infection, but viruses also regulate SG formation to facilitate their survival. Here, we show that the 2A protease of EV71 induced TIA-1 foci formation, and we analyzed these TIA-1 foci and found that they were different from typical stress granules (tSGs); thus, we named them atypical stress granules (aSGs). 2A alone could block tSG formation, and we found that protease activity of 2A was required for aSG induction and tSG blockage, but functioned in different ways. When the protease activity of 2A in EV71 was blocked (EV71-2AC110S), the tSGs but not aSGs appeared in infected cells. These tSGs contained cellular and viral mRNAs and translation initiation factors to inhibit viral translation, but aSGs contained only cellular mRNAs to promote viral translation.

Regardless of the environmental cue, all cells use molecular signaling pathways to respond to those changes. Many are transmitted by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. While these pathways have been studied independently for decades, less is known about how they coordinate with each other to carry out the proper response, particularly when conflicting signals are present. One way coordination can be achieved is through “second messenger” molecules produced by one pathway to regulate another pathway. Here, we identify candidate second messengers of osmotic stress by global metabolite profiling analysis of the yeast S. cerevisiae. We find that three branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolites increase in response to osmotic stress and require the stress response MAPK Hog1. We show that these BCAA derivatives are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the effects of osmotic stress on the GPCR pathway. Our results identify a new way that HOG and GPCR pathways communicate, and may in the future guide better treatment strategies for stress-related cell damage."

Postmeiotically, X and Y chromosome–encoded genes are consequently expressed at a low level, with the exception of genes present in many copies, which can achieve a higher level of expression. Gene amplification is a notable feature of the X and Y chromosomes, and it has been proposed that this serves to compensate for the postmeiotic repression. The long arm of the mouse Y chromosome (MSYq) has multicopy genes organized in clusters over several megabases. On the basis of analysis of mice carrying MSYq deletions, we proposed that MSYq encodes genetic information that is crucial for postmeiotic repression of the sex chromosomes and for sperm differentiation. The gene(s) responsible for these functions were, however, unknown. In this study, using transgenically delivered small interfering RNA, we disrupted the function of Sly, a gene that is present in more than 100 copies on MSYq. Sly-deficient males have major sperm differentiation problems together with a remarkable postmeiotic derepression of genes encoded on the X and Y chromosomes. Furthermore, the epigenetic modifications normally associated with sex chromosome repression are altered. Our data thus show that the SLY protein is required to mediate postmeiotic repression of the X and Y chromosomes. It is likely that the sperm differentiation problems in Sly-deficient males are largely a consequence of the derepression of the sex chromosomes in spermatids. We propose that the postmeiotic repressive effect of Sly on genes encoded on the X and Y chromosomes drove their massive amplification in the mouse."

A large fraction of Alu elements are located within intronic sequences. The human transcriptome undergoes extensive RNA editing (A-to-I), to higher levels than any other tested organism. RNA editing requires the formation of a double-stranded RNA structure in order to occur. Over 90% of the editing sites in the human transcriptome are found within Alu sequences. Thus, the high level of RNA editing is indicative of extensive secondary structure formation in mRNA precursors driven by intronic Alu-Alu base pairing. Splicing is a molecular mechanism in which introns are removed from an mRNA precursor and exons are ligated to form a mature mRNA. Here, we show that Alu insertions into introns can affect the splicing of the flanking exons. We experimentally demonstrate that two Alu elements that were inserted into the same intron in opposite orientation undergo base-pairing, and consequently shift the splicing pattern of the downstream exon from constitutive inclusion in all mature mRNA molecules to alternative skipping. This emphasizes the impact of Alu elements on the primate-specific transcriptome evolution, as such events can generate new isoforms that might acquire novel functions."

Our objective is to make GWAS amenable to bacterial genomes. These genomes can be too different to be aligned against a reference, even within a single species, making the description of their genetic variation challenging. We test the association between the phenotype and the presence in the genomes of DNA subsequences of length k – the so-called k-mers. These k-mers provide a versatile descriptor, allowing to capture genetic variants ranging from local polymorphisms to insertions of large mobile genetic elements. Unfortunately, they are also redundant and difficult to interpret. We rely on the compacted De Bruijn graph (cDBG), which represents the overlaps between k-mers. A single cDBG is built across all genomes, automatically removing the redundancy among consecutive k-mers, and allowing for a visualisation of the genomic context of the significant ones. We provide a computationally efficient and user-friendly implementation, enabling non-bioinformaticians to carry out GWAS on thousands of isolates in a few hours. This approach was effective in catching the dynamics of mobile genetic elements in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes, and retrieved known local polymorphisms in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes."

This post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is realized by a variety of mRNA-binding proteins, which target specific mRNA sequence elements in a signal-dependent manner. Here we describe a molecular switch mechanism where the exchange of two mRNA-binding proteins is regulated by stress and inflammatory signals. This switch operates between stabilization and efficient translation of the target mRNA, when the activator protein of translational initiation binds instead of the phosphorylated destabilizing protein, and translational arrest and degradation of the target, when the non-phosphorylated destabilizing protein replaces the activator. This mechanism is specific to the mRNA of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and the mRNA of its regulator protein TTP and, hence, enables fast inflammatory response and its stringent feedback control."

Here we investigate the critical role of the combined effects of maximum growth rate, cell size, motion, and elemental stoichiometry on nutrient transport kinetics and thence growth kinetics. By applying mechanistic scaling of nutrient uptake our results identify fundamental shortcomings in the interpretation of empirically derived relationships used to describe nutrient uptake in microbes. While the amount of nutrient required to grow at a given rate under nutrient limited conditions increases rapidly with cell size, the maximum growth rate scales directly with the environmental nutrient concentration. Requiring less nutrient at lower maximum growth rates, cells can therefore remain healthier at lower resource abundance. Further, decreased carbon content per cell lowers demand for nutrient transport per surface area significantly. This allows larger phytoplankton cells, like diatoms, to significantly increase their competitive advantage with increasing sedimentation rates. These findings have important implications for numerical models both in a context of theoretical ecology and applied science. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for organism physiology and related feedbacks in ecological applications and climate change studies."

Due to lack of vaccines and prophylactic drugs, vector control is the only method of disease prevention. Small (0.25×0.5 m) insecticide-treated targets have been shown to be cost-efficient for several Palpalis group tsetse flies, but there are concerns that they may become obscured by vegetation with a subsequent reduction in efficiency. We showed that the efficiency of the small targets was largely uncompromised by vegetation encroachment because G. f. fuscipes readily enter between and under vegetation to locate a small target, e.g. into small (1 m diameter) site clearings and underneath a very low (0.5 m) canopy. This implies that the dense vegetation, typical of the riverine habitats of Palpalis group tsetse, will not compromise the performance of tiny targets, as long as there are adequate openings of >30 cm between vegetation. Moreover, the maintanence of cleared areas around targets seems less important for the control of G. f. fuscipes with consequent savings in costs for control operations."

More recently, a small group including the legumes and close relatives has evolved the ability to accommodate nitrogen-fixing bacteria intracellularly. The resulting symbiosis is manifested by the formation of specialized root organs, the nodules, and comes in two forms: the interaction of legumes with rhizobia, and the more widespread Actinorhiza symbiosis of mostly woody plants with Frankia bacteria. The symbiosis receptor kinase SYMRK acts in a signalling pathway that legume plants require to trigger the development of nodules and the uptake of fungi or bacteria into their root cells. Here we show that the induction of Actinorhiza nodulation also relies on SYMRK, consistent with the idea that both types of nodulation evolved by recruiting common signalling genes from the pre-existing AM program. We observed that SYMRK from different land plant lineages differs significantly in exon composition, with a “full-length” version in the nodulating clade and shorter SYMRK genes in plants outside this lineage. Only the most complete SYMRK version was fully functional in nodulation, suggesting this gene played a central role in the recruitment event associated with the evolution of intracellular root symbioses with bacteria."

Nrf2-activating drugs hold promise for the treatment of diseases that are connected to oxidative stress or inflammation. We identified Fs(1)h, a bromodomain-containing BET protein, as a negative regulator of Nrf2 function in Drosophila. BET proteins are involved in transcription regulation and chromatin organization and have been implicated in several diseases, including cancer. Fs(1)h interacts with acetylated lysines on CncC, the homolog of Nrf2 in Drosophila, and thereby prevents target gene activation. Nrf2 can be released from this inhibitory effect by small molecules that specifically interfere with the binding of BET proteins to acetylated targets. Fs(1)h regulates Nrf2 independently of Keap1, a well-studied Nrf2 regulator. Consequently, chemical inhibitors of Keap1 and of Fs(1)h can be combined to achieve synergistic activation of Nrf2 target genes and strongly boost oxidative stress tolerance in Drosophila. The Keap1-independent mechanism of Nrf2 regulation is conserved in mammals. We suggest that the synergistic effect of combinatorial Nrf2 targeting drugs may be effective for the treatment of different oxidative stress and inflammation-related diseases."

Its life cycle is complex and divided into two phases, one in the tsetse fly vector and one in the bloodstream of the mammalian host. Molecular tools for gene function analyses in parasitic organisms are essential. Previous studies described the possibility of completing the entire T. congolense life cycle in vitro. However, the model showed major flaws including the absence of stable long-term culture of the infectious bloodstream forms, a laborious time-consuming period to perform the cycle and a lack of genetic tools. We therefore aimed to develop a standardized model convenient for genetic engineering. We succeeded in producing long-term cultures of all the developmental stages on long-term, to define all the differentiation steps and to finally complete the whole cycle in vitro. This improved model offers the opportunity to conduct phenotype analyses of genetically modified strains throughout the in vitro cycle and also during experimental infections."

We have previously found that platelet binding by Streptococcus mitis is mediated by surface components encoded by a bacteriophage contained within the host bacterium. We now show that lysin (an enzyme of bacteriophage origin) contributes to platelet binding via its direct interaction with fibrinogen on the platelet surface. Lysin bound to purified fibrinogen in vitro, and this interaction specifically involved the Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen. Binding of lysin to the Bβ chain was further localized to a region within the fibrinogen D fragment. Disruption of the gene encoding lysin gene resulted in a significant reduction in binding to fibrinogen by S. mitis, as well as a major reduction in virulence, as measured by a rat model of endocarditis. These results indicate that lysin is a multifunctional protein, representing a new class of fibrinogen-binding molecules. Lysin is localized to the bacterial surface via its interaction with cell wall choline, where it then can bind fibrinogen directly. Cell surface lysin apparently also contributes to the development of endovascular infections via its previously unrecognized fibrinogen binding activity."

Since then results have not lived up to the expectations. The development of comparative genomics to further understanding of P. falciparum has indeed been hindered by a lack of knowledge of closely related species' genomes. Only one species, P. reichenowi, infecting chimpanzees, was hitherto known as a sister lineage of P. falciparum. Here we describe a new Plasmodium species infecting chimpanzees in Africa. Based on its whole mitochondrial genome, we demonstrate that this species is a relative of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi. The analysis of its genome should thus offer the opportunity to explore P. falciparum specific adaptations to humans. Our results bring new elements to the debate surrounding the origin of this lineage. They suggest that it may have been present in early hominoids and may have experienced a radiation congruent with that of its hosts. Our discovery highlights the paucity of our knowledge on the richness of Plasmodium species infecting primates and calls for more research in this direction."

The ultimate goal of these therapies is to reverse the aberrant epigenetic modifications observed in cancer cells, thereby restoring cells to a “normal” state. 5-Aza-CdDR, a FDA approved drug for MDS treatment, reverses a chemical modification of the DNA resulting in gene reactivation. The data presented here show the importance of H2A.Z, a special DNA packaging protein variant, in the gene reactivation process induced by 5-Aza-CdR. The presence of H2A.Z facilitates the access of proteins at gene regulatory regions, which is a necessary step for gene re-expression.

Most studies support ticks of the genus Hyalomma as the main CCHFV vectors, but some laboratory reports and field studies also allude to other tick species that may be responsible for virus circulation. Here we converted the tick-host interactions of 133 species of ticks with reported geographical distribution over the range of CCHFV into a network of relationships. By a series of network analyses, we found that immatures of the genus Hyalomma are unique in their hosts preferences among the examined tick genera. Immatures of the genus Hyalomma concentrate on rodent and rabbit hosts, which most efficiently support CCHFV maintenance and transmission by ticks in nature. Based on these data, we formulate the hypothesis that the ecological relationships between Hyalomma spp. and their hosts form a delicate equilibrum that differentiates human epidemics from periods of silent CCHFV maintenance."

We analyze data from more than a hundred salamander retinal ganglion cells and characterize their collective response using maximum entropy models of statistical physics. With these models in hand, we can put bounds on the amount of information encoded by the neural population, constructively demonstrate that the code has error correcting redundancy, and advance two hypotheses about the neural code: that collective states of the network could carry stimulus information, and that the distribution of neural activity patterns has very nontrivial statistical properties, possibly related to critical systems in statistical physics."

Of tick-transmitted pathogens, Babesia, an intracellular haemoprotozoan parasite causing a malaria-like disease, called babesiosis, gain increasing interest due to its zoonotic significance. When vector ticks acquire the protozoa via blood-meals, they invade midgut and undergo several developmental stages prior to exit through salivary glands. It has long been conceived that midguts of these ticks evolve diverse innate immune mechanisms and perform blood digestion critical for tick survival. A cysteine proteinase, longipain, was identified from the three-host tick Haemaphysalis longicornis, which shows potent parasiticidal activity. Longipain is localized in midgut epithelium and its expression is induced by blood feeding. This protein is passively secreted into midgut lumen where it exerts enzymatic degradation of blood-meals. A series of experiments unveil that longipain-knockdown ticks when fed on Babesia-infected dog, exhibited a significantly increased numbers of parasites compared with controls. Longipain has shown to interact on the surface of Babesia parasites in vitro and in vivo, and is thought to mediate direct killing of the parasites, suggesting that longipain may be a potential chemotherapeutic target against babesiosis and ticks themselves."

In particular, the existence and the characteristics of the channel(s) used by O2 to travel from the solvent/membrane to the binuclear site are still unclear. In this work, we combine all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and implicit ligand sampling calculations in order to identify and characterize the O2 delivery channels in the Ccox from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Altogether, our results suggest that, in this Ccox, O2 can diffuse via three well-defined channels that start in membrane region (where O2 solubility is higher than in the water). One of these channels corresponds to the pathway inferred from the X-ray data available, whereas the other two are alternative routes for O2 to reach the binuclear center."

In detail, we show that eIF3 and HCR1 not only promote the initiation phase but also specifically act at the other end of the translational cycle during termination. We present genetic and biochemical data linking eIF3 and HCR1 with both eukaryotic release factors (eRF1 and eRF3) and the ribosomal recycling factor ABCE1/RLI1, and propose a model for how all these factors co-operate with each other to ensure stringent selection of the stop codon.

However, how oncogene inactivation leads to tumor regression is not clear. Previously, we have shown that even the brief inactivation of the MYC oncogene can result in the sustained regression of at least some tumors. To understand the mechanism, we have utilized several novel genomic analyses to define a set of genes that strongly correlate with the ability of the MYC oncogene to maintain tumorigenesis. First, we generated a novel data set from microarray analyses of murine tumors that we analyzed by StepMiner to identify discrete step changes in gene expression after the inactivation or the reactivation of the MYC oncogene. Second, we utilized Boolean Network Analysis to further define the subset of genes highly correlated with MYC in human tumorigenesis. Third, we utilized ChIP analysis to demonstrate that in many cases the permanent changes of gene expression we uncovered were associated with changes in the ability of MYC to occupy the promoter locus. Our general strategy could be similarly utilized in other experimental model systems to understand how specific oncogenes contribute to the maintenance of tumorigenesis."

It is potentially fatal and the most challenging to treat. The current study highlighted that, most patients were young adult males, from rural areas of the Sudan and of low socioeconomic status. The lack of medical and health facilities, financial constrains and compounded by poor health education in endemic areas meant that most of the studied patients presented late with advanced disease. The diagnosis of mycetoma in the studied population was confirmed by several imaging techniques; MRI, CT scan and radiography and tissue diagnosis by histopathology and cytology techniques. The treatment outcome was rather unsatisfactory. The cure rate was low, the dropout rate was high and the disease was associated with high morbidity. Structured and objective health education programmes in the endemic areas is important to encourage patients to seek medical advice early in the course of the disease particularly that there is no clear preventive or control measurement in mycetoma."

This protein degradation pathway has a large number of components, including hundreds of ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) that are predicted to have regulatory roles in cell homeostasis, cell cycle control, and development. Recent research revealed the molecular composition of CULLIN3 (CUL3)-based E3 ligases, which are essential enzymes in both metazoans and plants. Here, we report that in the model plant A. thaliana, CUL3 modulates the emission of ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone that controls a variety of processes such as fruit ripening and stress response. In particular, we provide evidence that CUL3 regulates root growth by a novel ethylene-dependant pathway. Thus, we showed that CUL3 knockdown inhibits primary root growth by reducing the root meristem size. Finally, we also identified a function of CUL3 in distal root patterning. Indeed, CUL3 function is required for normal division and organisation of the root stem cell niche and columella root cap cells. Overall, our results show that Arabidopsis CUL3 is essential for plant growth and development, not only during embryogenesis but also at post-embryonic stages."

As the incidences of cancer increase worldwide, the importance of these chronic inflammatory conditions on the development of cancer becomes more important. Several bacterial, viral and parasitic infections are already known to influence cancer development but as colon cancer is particularly prevalent worldwide, we wanted to assess the effect of a large intestinal dwelling worm, Trichuris muris (T. muris) on its aetiology. This whipworm is a natural infection of mice and has significant homology to human whipworm. From our studies, we showed that chronic infection alone induced changes in the caecum of the mouse that were comparable to those seen with a well-known carcinogen. In addition to this, T. muris infection was also able to increase the development of adenomas in the small intestine of mutant mice that spontaneously develop tumours. This change was abrogated if a T regulatory cell type was blocked during infection. The T regulatory cell type that arises during infection has been shown to play an important role in protecting the host from damage caused by the parasite and the immune response to it. The present study using the mouse model however, suggests that regulatory T cells can have negative effects, at least in terms of the development of bowel cancer. As so many people live with chronic, regulated parasitic infections, the importance of the parasites in cancer development may therefore be significant."

Mutations in XPF are linked to xeroderma pigmentosum, characterized by sun sensitivity, high incidence of skin cancer, and neurodegeneration, or XFE progeroid syndrome, a disease of accelerated aging. Herein we report the unexpected finding that mutations in XPF cause mislocalization of XPF-ERCC1 to the cytoplasm. Recombinant mutant XPF-ERCC1 derived from XP– and XFE–causing alleles are catalytically active and if delivered to the nucleus of cells restore DNA repair. This demonstrates that protein mislocalization contributes to defective DNA repair and disease arising as a consequence of mutations in XPF. It also illustrates a novel mechanism of regulating a cell's capacity for DNA repair: by manipulating nuclear localization of XPF-ERCC1 to enhance or inhibit repair and to prevent cancer or tumor resistance to chemotherapy, respectively."

They also serve as the ecological model for the evolution of drug resistance by diseases and for host–pathogen interactions in general. Revealing who wins these arms races and how they do so is critical to our understanding of these processes. Capitalizing on the geographic mosaic of species interactions, we examined the dynamics of the arms race between snakes and their toxic newt prey. Garter snakes in some populations have evolved dramatic resistance to the tetrodotoxin defense of the their local prey. By evaluating the pattern of mismatches between toxicity and resistance, we discovered that predators sometimes escape the arms race through the evolution of extreme resistance, but that prey never come out ahead. The reason for this one-sided outcome appears to depend on the molecular genetic basis of resistance in snakes, wherein changes to a single amino acid residue can confer huge differences in resistance."

Paradoxically, heterozygous deletion or mutation of certain Rps can actually promote growth and proliferation and in some cases bestow predisposition to cancer. The underlying mechanism(s) behind these unexpected overgrowth phenotypes despite impairment of ribosome biogenesis has remained obscure. We have addressed this question using the power of Drosophila genetics, taking advantage of our observation that four different Rp mutants, or Minutes, are able to suppress a small rough eye phenotype associated with a mutation of the essential controller of cell proliferation cyclin E (cycEJP). Our findings demonstrate that suppression of cycEJP by the RpS6 mutant is exerted via a tissue non-autonomous mechanism whereby reduced Rp in the prothoracic gland decreases activity of the steroid hormone ecdysone, delaying development and hence allowing time for compensatory growth. These data provide for the first time a rationale to explain the counter-intuitive organ overgrowth phenotypes observed for certain Drosophila Minutes. Our findings also have implications for the effect of Rp mutants on endocrine related control of tissue growth in higher organisms."

Human possessing a single copy of Gata4 mutation display congenital heart defects (CHD), including double outlet right ventricle (DORV). DORV is an alignment problem in which both the Aorta and Pulmonary Artery originate from the right ventricle, instead of originating from the left and the right ventricles, respectively. In this study, a Gata4 mutant mouse model was used to study how Gata4 mutations cause DORV. We showed that Gata4 is required in the cardiac precursor cells for the normal alignment of the great arteries. Although Gata4 mutations inhibit the rapid increase in the cardiac precursor cell numbers, resolving this problem does not recover the normal alignment of the great arteries. It indicates that there is a migratory issue of the cardiac precursor cells as they navigate to the great arteries during development. The study further showed that a specific molecular signaling, Hh-signaling and Gata6 are responsible to the Gata4 action in the cardiac precursor cells. Importantly, over-activation of the Hh-signaling pathways rescues the DORV in the Gata4 mutant embryos. This study provides a molecular model to explain the ontogeny of a subtype of CHD."

Although the understanding of this enigmatic pathogen has improved after decades of research, the mode of transmission is yet to be fully elucidated. Recent epidemiological studies have shown an underrepresentation of Buruli ulcer cases in children below the age of four as compared to older children. In order to investigate the different exposure of children to M. ulcerans and to several other pathogens with diverse modes of transmission, we conducted a sero-epidemiological study of 1,352 residents within a five kilometer radius along the Offin River of Ghana. While our results show early exposure of children to the mosquito transmitted malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum as well as to soil transmitted helminths of the genus Strongyloides, a later onset of immune response was observed at an age of around four and five years for M. ulcerans and the trematode Schistosoma mansoni, that is transmitted by contact with infested water. Similarities in age-dependent exposure of these two pathogens suggest that transmission may take place outside of the very young children’s movement range when they come into contact with the environment at the periphery of their villages."

Since that time additional genes have been identified, but collectively they only explain a minority of cases. In this work we sought to further elucidate the genetic basis of this disorder using exome sequencing of 202 individuals with PVNH. We found a clear role for de novo mutations in PVNH, although with this analysis alone we were unable to pinpoint which of the de novo mutations in novel genes caused the disease. One patient was found to have a de novo variant in MAP1B, a gene that encodes a protein that plays a role at several key steps of brain development. With further analysis of the exome sequence data we found an additional three cases with a very rare inherited variant in MAP1B. This pattern is not expected to occur by chance and therefore indicates that these variants are likely responsible for the PVNH in these patients. Further strengthing the association of MAP1B in PVNH, all of the patients with a MAP1B variant had a similar brain abnormality, and at least one of the parents who transmitted the variant to their child was also similarly affected. This work adds to a growing list of genes responsible for PVNH, illuminates new genes involved in brain development, and importantly informs us about the types of genetic variants involved in PVNH."

Each embryonic stem cell (ESC) in a population exhibits fluctuating Nanog levels resulting in heterogeneity which affects cell fate specification. The allelic regulation of Nanog was demonstrated recently but its implications on population heterogeneity are unclear. We developed a multiscale population balance equation (PBE) model and compared our results with pertinent experimental studies. Under allelic control the profile of Nanog features three peaks or distinct states. Transcriptional noise causes the distribution to become bimodal as suggested previously. When stem cells carrying a reporter transgene in an allelically regulated locus were examined, we observed non-matching distributions of the endogenous and reporter proteins. This led us to investigate the performance of reporter systems depending on insertion of the transgene in one or both alleles and the protein degradation dynamics. Lastly, our model was employed to address how allelic regulation affects the maintenance of pluripotency in stem cells with a single Nanog allele deletion. A fraction of these cells remains pluripotent while deletion of a single allele does not simply reduce NANOG uniformly for all ESCs but modulates NANOG heterogeneity directly."

To represent this wide range of signals effectively, neurons use various mechanisms that regulate the total input they receive. On the one hand, feedforward inhibition adjusts the relative contribution of individual inputs inversely proportional to the total number of active afferents, implementing a form of input normalization. On the other hand, synaptic scaling uniformly rescales the efficacy of incoming synapses to stabilize the neuron's firing rate after learning-induced changes in drive. Given that these mechanisms often act on the same neurons, we ask here if there are any benefits in combining the two. We show that the interaction between the two has important computational consequences, beyond their traditional role in maintaining network homeostasis. When combined with lateral inhibition, synaptic scaling and fast feedforward inhibition allow the circuit to learn efficiently from noisy, ambiguous inputs. For inputs not normalized by feed-forward inhibition, learning is less efficient. Given that feed-forward inhibition and synaptic scaling have been reported in various systems, our results suggest that they could generally facilitate learning in neural circuits. More broadly, our work emphasizes the importance of studying the interaction between different plasticity mechanisms for understanding circuit function."

In Arabidopsis thaliana, two redundant histone methyltransferases, ATXR5 and ATXR6, are responsible for the deposition of a silencing epigenetic mark, histone H3 lysine 27 monomethylation. Loss of ATXR5/6 results in transcriptional activation of transposable elements (TEs), upregulation of DNA damage response genes and a genomic instability defect characterized as an excess of DNA corresponding to heterochromatin regions. Using a genetic screen, we sought to find suppressors of the atxr5/6 phenotype, and interestingly, we identified multiple genes implicated in general transcriptional activity. Through genomic characterization of the mutants our data suggest a model where transcriptional silencing of heterochromatin during S-phase is required for proper replication and maintenance of genome stability. These findings emphasize the important relationship between chromatin, transcriptional control and replication in the maintenance of genome stability in a eukaryotic system and identify new players involved in these processes."

Previous computational research proposed various differential Hebbian learning (DHL) rules that rely on the activation of neurons and time derivatives of their activations to capture specific temporal relations between neural events. However, empirical research of brain plasticity, in particular plasticity depending on sequences of pairs of spikes involving the pre- and the post-synaptic neurons, i.e., spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), shows that the brain uses a surprisingly wide variety of different learning mechanisms that cannot be captured by the DHL rules proposed so far. Here we propose a general differential Hebbian learning (G-DHL) rule able to generate all existing DHL rules and many others. We show various examples of how the rule can be used to update the synapse in many different ways based on the temporal relation between neural events in pairs of artificial neurons. Moreover, we show the flexibility of the G-DHL rule by applying it to successfully fit several different STDP processes recorded in the brain. Overall, the G-DHL rule represents a new tool for conducting research on learning processes that depend on the timing of signal events."

From yeasts to humans, replication of DNA ends, called telomeres, is accomplished by a telomere-dedicated reverse transcriptase called telomerase that uses its RNA subunit as a template. We show that there are two genetically distinct pathways that recruit yeast telomerase, Est2p, to telomeres in a cell cycle–dependent manner. Only one of the two pathways, the pathway operating late in the cell cycle, is required for telomere maintenance. In telomerase-deficient strains, the amount of Est2p that is telomere-bound late in the cell cycle is about 50% of wild type levels. Maintenance of functional levels of Est2p late in the cell cycle requires that Est1p, another telomerase subunit, be telomere-bound. In addition, Est1p must be associated with Est2p via an interaction between it and telomerase RNA. Human telomerase is not active in most somatic cells, but is critical for stem cell longevity. Even a modest reduction in telomerase has a serious impact on human health.

Here we compare two related compounds (PF846, PF8503) that selectively stall human translation to the effects of a more general translation inhibitor, homoharringtonin. We used genome-wide approaches to probe the effects of these compounds, including measurements of which messenger RNAs are being translated and the effects of knocking down gene expression on cell growth. These experiments revealed new and surprising genetic connections between ribosome quality control pathways. We then used biochemical and cell-based experiments to test the involvement of particular ribosome quality control proteins such as ASCC2, ASCC3 and HBS1L in the physiological response of cells to translation inhibitors. The genetic and biochemical insights presented here should aid the development of next-generation selective translation inhibitors to treat disease."

This process requires the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO). FOXO modulates the expression of many genes, and the list of those associated with slow aging is impressive. But there are few data indicating the mechanisms or genes through which FOXO actually slows aging. Here, we identify a novel FOXO target, dawdle, the Activin-like ligand in fruit flies. We show that down-regulation of Activin signaling in muscle, but not in adipose tissue, leads to extended lifespan. In part it does so when it alleviates the negative transcriptional repression of its Smox transcription factor (a Smad transcription factor) upon a keystone autophagy gene, Atg8a. This double signaling cascade autonomously improves muscle performance (measured at cellular and functional levels) and nonautonomously extends lifespan as it reduces the secretion of insulin peptides from the brain. The work develops the emerging model for interacting autonomous-nonautonomous roles of insulin/IGF signaling as a systems integrative mechanism of aging control."

The resulting clots can form under different flow conditions in the veins as well as the arteries. The excessive and undesirable formation of clots (i.e., thrombosis) in our circulatory system may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Some of these pathologies are deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and atherothrombosis (thrombosis triggered by plaque rupture) in coronary arteries, to name a few. The process of clot formation and growth at a site on a blood vessel wall involves a number of simultaneous processes including: multiple chemical reactions in the coagulation cascade, species transport and platelet adhesion all of which are strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic forces. Numerical models for blood clotting normally focus on one of the processes under a specific flow condition. Here, we propose a general numerical model that encompass a wide range of hemodynamic conditions in the veins and arteries, with individual platelets and their adhesive dynamics included explicitly in the models. Further, we include the biochemistry of coagulation cascade, which is essential to modeling thrombus formation, and couple that to our platelet aggregation model. The simulation results—tested against three different experiments—demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in capturing the in vivo and in vitro experimental observations."

In this work, we used gene expression and virus growth data from influenza-infected mice to determine how moderate and deadly influenza viruses may invoke unique inflammatory responses and the role these responses play in disease pathology. We found that the relationship between virus growth and the inflammatory response for all viruses tested can be characterized by ultrasensitive response in which the inflammatory response is gated until a threshold concentration of virus is exceeded in the lung after which strong inflammatory gene expression and cytokine production occurs. This finding challenges the notion that deadly influenza viruses invoke unique cytokine and inflammatory responses and provides additional evidence that pathology is regulated by virus load, albeit in a highly nonlinear fashion. These findings suggests immunomodulatory treatments could focus on altering inflammatory response dynamics to improve disease pathology."

EJCs, with Y14, Mago, eIF4AIII and Barentsz proteins at their core, are landmarks of the nuclear history of RNAs and play important roles in their post-transcriptional regulation. In mammalian cells, the Y14-Mago interacting protein PYM associates with ribosomes and disassembles EJCs in the cytoplasm. However, the physiological function of PYM and its regulation in vivo remains unknown. We have analysed PYM function during Drosophila oogenesis, where the EJC is essential for oskar mRNA localization in the oocyte, a prerequisite for embryonic patterning and germline formation. We find that Drosophila PYM interacts with Y14-Mago but, in contrast to mammalian PYM, does not bind ribosomes. We demonstrate that EJCs associated with oskar mRNA in vivo are disassembled by PYM over-expression in a translation-independent manner, causing oskar mislocalization. Our in vivo analysis shows that the Drosophila PYM C-terminal domain modulates PYM-Y14-Mago interaction, revealing that PYM is regulated in Drosophila. Furthermore, PYM is essential for viability of flies lacking one functional copy of y14 or mago, supporting a role of PYM in EJC homeostasis. Our results highlight a distinct mode of regulation of the EJC-dissociating protein PYM in Drosophila."

Once swimming in the mammalian bloodstream, it causes the devastating African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. During its complex life cycle, it undergoes many cell shape changes, which are important for efficient parasite transmission. Here, we have studied a cell structure intrinsically involved in shape acquisition during division of the T. brucei life cycle form that multiplies in the fly midgut. Using electron tomography we show the 3D architecture of a motile cellular junction that slides with the tip of the growing new flagellum along the side of the old flagellum. This enables the new flagellum to zip in to the cell body structure alongside the old flagellum after which the cleavage furrow is established between these two flagella, producing two daughter cells of similar cell shape. We present here a detailed architectural overview of this junction; we show that it matures with time and pushes the old flagellum’s axoneme sideways as it passes. This structural map enables insight into the function of this extraordinary mobile cellular junction."

Somatic linker histones have been thought of as a group of similar proteins with redundant functions with few known differences among them. Our work uncovers for the first time a novel and unique role for the linker histone H1.5 (HIST1H1B). We found that H1.5, but not H1.3 (HIST1H1D), forms blocks of chromatin binding in genic and intergenic regions in differentiated human cells from all germ layers but not in embryonic stem cells. In genic regions, H1.5 binds to a large fraction of gene families that encode membrane associated proteins and are transcriptionally silent in a tissue-specific manner. H1.5 binding is associated with other repressive chromatin elements such as SIRT1 binding and H3K9me2 enrichment, and it negatively correlates with Pol II distribution. SIRT1 and H3K9me2 binding is dependent on H1.5, but not vice versa. H1.5 depletion in fibroblasts leads to increased chromatin accessibility at its target loci, altered cell cycle, and deregulation of gene expression. Our findings show that H1.5 has a dynamic distribution during human cell differentiation and is required for maintenance of proper gene expression in differentiated cells."

In this study we show how trisomy of Erg in a murine Down syndrome model perturbs hematopoietic progenitor cells in a manner similar to that observed in human Down syndrome by inducing gene expression changes and lineage priming in early multi-potential progenitors. We show that the gene expression signature specifically attributable to trisomy of Erg in the murine model is strongly correlated with gene expression changes in human Down syndrome hematopoietic cells. The data suggest that Erg is an important regulator of megakaryocyte-erythroid lineage specification in multipotential hematopoietic cells and that trisomy of Erg in the context of DS prediposes to a transient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryocyte leukaemia in a multi-step model of leukemogenesis."

However, past studies of auditory cortex generally find that in response to a single sound source, there is not a precise representation of spatial location in the cortex, which makes this effect of spatial location hard to understand. Here, we presented zebra finches with two simultaneous sounds (a birdsong target and a noise masking sound) from distinct spatial locations and recorded neural responses in field L, which is analogous to primary auditory cortex in mammals. When the target sound was presented by itself, the location of the source had little effect on the ability to identify the target song based on neural activity in field L. However, when the target was presented with a masker sound, the location of both sources strongly affected neural discrimination performance. Moreover, different subpopulations of neurons preferentially encoded either target or masker, providing a potential substrate for spatial selective attention. Thus, even though location is not well coded in cortical neurons, spatial information strongly modulates cortical responses."

Wolbachia is a bacterial symbiont that is found in many species of insects, and several strains are known to protect the insects against viral infection. We took 19 strains of Wolbachia from different species of Drosophila fruit flies, transferred them into Drosophila simulans, and then infected these flies with two different viruses. We found that about half of the strains slowed the death of flies after viral infection. Given that 40% of terrestrial arthropods may be infected with Wolbachia, this suggests that many species may benefit from this protection. These increases in survival were tightly linked to reductions in the levels of the virus in the insect, suggesting that Wolbachia is reducing the viruses' ability to replicate. Despite the two viruses we used being very different, the level of protection that a Wolbachia strain provided against the two viruses tended to be very similar, suggesting that a single general mechanism underlies the antiviral effects. The extent to which a Wolbachia strain provides protection against viral infection depends largely on the bacterial density— the more Wolbachia, the greater the protection."

Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient for bacterial pathogens during infection. To prevent infection, the host limits Mn bioavailability to invading bacteria in an active process known as nutritional immunity. To overcome this limitation, bacteria produce high-affinity Mn uptake systems to scavenge Mn from host tissues. Here, we identified the main Mn transporters of E. faecalis and show that, by working collectively, they are essential for growth of this opportunistic pathogen in Mn-restricted environments. Notably, the inability to acquire Mn during infection rendered E. faecalis virtually avirulent in different animal models, thereby revealing the essentiality of Mn acquisition to enterococcal pathogenesis. The results reported here highlight that bacterial Mn transport systems are promising targets for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies, which are expected to be particularly powerful to combat enterococcal infections."

When patients are immunosuppressed, particularly in kidney and bone marrow transplantation, the virus can reactivate and result in severe disease. BKPyV-related disease has risen due to the use of newer immunosuppressive regimens and an increase in the number of transplants performed each year. We are interested in understanding the interactions between BKPyV and host cell components or pathways, with the aim of developing more BKPyV-specific antiviral treatment options. In this study we characterized the relationship between BKPyV infection and the cellular DNA damage response (DDR), a signaling cascade that is initiated by cells to repair damaged DNA molecules. Our study indicated that BKPyV activates and hijacks the DDR to facilitate its infection and that various components of the DDR may play distinct roles during this process. These data suggest that the DDR may provide a potential host target to control BKPyV reactivation in transplant recipients."

Moreover, within a given species and differentiation status, cells increase their size in an exquisitely proportional manner to the number of chromosomes. This correlation has been observed in fungi, plants, and animals, and it is assumed to have important implications in development and physiology. However, the molecular mechanisms that set cell size as a function of ploidy are still a mystery. Here, we uncover a pathway that links the number of chromosomes to the molecular network that triggers cell cycle entry in budding yeast. More specifically, we have found that an excess number of centromeres (CENs) increases degradation of Cln3, a G1 cyclin that plays a key role at Start, thus delaying entry into the cell cycle and, as cell growth is not affected, increasing cell size. Our results point to the existence of dedicated mechanisms operating during entry into the cell cycle to adjust cell size to ploidy."

We have shown that nuclear episomal viral DNA genomes of herpes viruses (KSHV, EBV and HSV-1) are sensed by the nuclear resident IFI16 protein, resulting in the formation of the IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome complex. Here, we show that BRCA1 promotes viral DNA sensing by IFI16 in the nucleus and is a constituent of the triggered IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome. IFI16 and BRCA1 are in complex in the nucleus and their association increases in the presence of KSHV, EBV or HSV-1 genomes, but not by the DNA damage response or vaccinia virus cytoplasmic dsDNA.

The proteins driving contraction – amongst them actin, tropomyosin, and the contraction-driving myosin motor – can show small changes in the way they are constructed, they can be expressed as different “isoforms”. The isoforms are supposedly tailored to support the specific contraction patterns, but for tropomyosin and actin it is unclear exactly how the isoforms' differences affect the interaction of actin and myosin that generates the muscle contraction. We measured actin movement outside the cellular environment, focusing on the effects of different isoform combinations of only actin, myosin, and tropomyosin. We found that the actin isoforms cause differences in the mechanical interaction only when tropomyosin is present, not without it. Also, all different actin-tropomyosin combinations affected the mechanical interactions in a different way. In our experiments we could not directly observe the mechanical interactions of actin, tropomyosin, and myosin, so we reconstructed them in a mathematical model. With this model, we could determine in detail how the different actin-tropomyosin combinations caused the differences that we observed in our experiments."

To survive, wasp larvae must overcome the immune defenses of their hosts. How parasitic wasps overcome host immunity is not fully understood even though we know that different strategies using venoms, virus-like particles, or viruses are involved. A unique class of viruses, called polydnaviruses is found in two families of wasps that comprise more than 20,000 wasp species. The genomes of polydnaviruses encode proteins with ankyrin repeats. Ankyrin repeats are also found in Cactus, the inhibitor protein of NF-κB signaling in Drosophila. Viral ankyrin proteins, or Vankyrins, however, lack the amino acid sequences necessary for turnover found in Cactus and mammalian IκB family members. We show that Vankyrins produced by polydnaviruses of a parasitic wasp that attacks caterpillars of many common agricultural pests can block NF-κB signaling in fruit fly larvae. This inhibition supports parasite success. Our work highlights the crucial role of NF-κB signaling across insect taxa in insect-insect and insect-virus interactions. Studies of polydnaviral ankyrin proteins in Drosophila reveal that immune-suppressive viruses may block both cellular and humoral immunity in insects to win the biological ‘arms race’."

This species has a multipart genome comprising one main chromosome, three secondary chromosomes, and a plasmid. Five DNA replication origins were found and confirmed to function in vivo. All are adjacent to genes for the initiator protein Cdc6/Orc1, a common feature of archaeal replication origins. Two of the sequences are located on the main chromosome, confirming that multiple origins are often used to replicate circular chromosomes in archaea. Intriguingly, one of the origins from a secondary chromosome appears “dominant” to the principal chromosomal origin, suggesting either a hierarchy or differential usage of origins. This might reflect the different replication requirements of their respective chromosomes. Given the ease of genetic manipulation, H. volcanii holds great promise for studying how replication of four chromosomes is regulated in the context of the archaeal cell cycle."

In insects, pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone precede molting and metamorphosis, the regulation of hormonal synthesis being a crucial step that determines animal viability and size. Reduced levels of the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO in the prothoracic gland block the synthesis of ecdysone, as SUMO is needed for cholesterol intake. Here we show that SUMO is required for the expression of Scavenger Receptors (Class B, type I). These membrane receptors are necessary for lipid uptake by the gland. Strikingly, their expression is sufficient to recover lipid content when SUMO is removed. The expression of the Scavenger Receptors depends on Ftz-f1, a nuclear transcription factor homologous to mammalian Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). Interestingly, the expression of Ftz-f1 also depends on SUMO and, in addition, Ftz-f1 is SUMOylated. This modification modulates its capacity to activate the Scavenger Receptor Snmp1. The role of SUMO, Scavenger Receptors, and Ftz-f1 on lipid intake is conserved in other tissues that synthesize steroid hormones, such as the ovaries. These factors are conserved in vertebrates, with mutations underlying human disease, so this mechanism to regulate lipid uptake could have implications for human health."

However, despite conservation of this ‘classical’ scheme there exist substantial variations in the mechanism of phosphotransfer among systems. Also, many sensor kinases exhibit phosphatase activity raising the question whether such a bifunctional architecture enables special regulatory properties in the response behavior to input signals. According to previous studies, classical two-component systems are unlikely to produce sigmoidal response curves (ultrasensitivity) if the sensor protein is bifunctional. Here, I argue that this is not necessarily true if the input stimulus (allosteric effector) reciprocally affects multiple activities of the sensor kinase, as it seems to be common for bifunctional enzymes. To this end, I propose and analyze an extension of the experimentally well-supported Batchelor-Goulian model which shows that ultrasensitivity requires a high-affinity effector and saturation of the phosphatase activity. The underlying mechanism involves sequestration of the effector by the sensor kinase which restricts the occurrence of ultrasensitivity to sufficiently low effector concentrations. Hence, this operating regime might be useful to sense effector limitations or to amplify weak input signals."

Sensory neurons encode and relay such complex peripheral information as electrical events, known as action potentials or spikes. The timing intervals between the spikes carry stimulus-relevant information. Therefore, disruption of spike timing by random perturbations can compromise the nervous system function. In this study we investigated whether the widely-distributed voltage-gated sodium (Na+) ion channels important for spike generation can also serve as noise modulators in sensory neurons. We developed and utilized mathematical models for the different experimentally inseparable components of a complex Na+ channel current. This enabled phenomenological simplification and examination of the individual roles of Na+ components in spike timing control. We further utilized real-time closed-loop experiments to validate model predictions, and theoretical analysis to explain experimental outcomes. Using such multifaceted approach, we uncovered a novel role for a resurgent Na+ component in enhancing the reliability of spike timing and in noise modulation. Furthermore, our simplified model can be utilized in future computational and experimental studies to better understand the pathological consequences of Na+ channelopathies."

It is therefore not surprising that persistent pathogens of viral, bacterial, and protozoal origin have evolved to inhibit the induction of host cell death. M. tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis, has latently infected about one third of the world's population and can persist for decades in the lungs of infected, asymptomatic individuals. In the present study we have identified nuoG of M. tuberculosis, which encodes a subunit of the type I NADH dehydrogenase complex, as a critical bacterial gene for inhibition of host cell death. A mutant of M. tuberculosis in which nuoG was deleted triggered a marked increase in apoptosis by infected macrophages, and subsequent analysis of this mutant in the mouse tuberculosis model provided direct evidence for a causal link between the capacity to inhibit apoptosis and bacterial virulence. The discovery of anti-apoptosis genes in M. tuberculosis could provide a powerful approach to the generation of better attenuated vaccine strains, and may also identify a new group of drug targets for improved chemotherapy."

Some members of the family, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, play key physiological roles in signal transduction at synapses. Despite many experimental and computational studies of the gating transition of these pentameric ion channels, the structural basis of how ligand binding couples to channel opening remains uncertain. In particular, the all-atom computer simulation of the gating transition is limited to nanosecond ∼ microsecond time scales while the entire transition takes tens of microseconds. In this study, we have employed a highly efficient coarse-grained modeling method to dissect the sequence of structural events underlying the gating transition. The model predictions are in broad agreement with the kinetic analysis of mutants of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This study has established a useful computational framework to simulate the functional dynamics of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels."

A better understanding of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of fatal patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is important in alerting clinicians of severe dengue and improving management. In a retrospective analysis of 10 adults who died of and 299 survived (controls) DHF, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) alone was found in only 20% of dengue-related death, while intractable massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was found in 40%, and DSS with concurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage, intractable massive GI bleeding with concurrent bacteremia, bacterial sepsis/meningitis, and sepsis due to ventilator associated pneumonia each were found in 10%.

This idea is supported by computational studies that have modeled the impact of microRNAs on the expression of their targets and the construction of artificial incoherent feedforward loops using synthetic biology tools. Here we show that this interesting principle of microRNA regulation actually occurs in a mammalian developmental system. We examine cell-to-cell variation of protein expression in developing mouse thymocytes by quantitative flow cytometry and find that the absence of microRNAs results in increased cell-to-cell variation in the expression of the microRNA target Cd69. Mechanistically, T cell receptor signaling induces both Cd69 and miR-17 and miR-20a, two microRNAs that target Cd69. Co-regulation of microRNAs and their target mRNA dampens the expression of Cd69 and forms an incoherent feedforward loop that reduces cell-to-cell variation on CD69 expression. In addition, miR-181, which also targets Cd69 and is a known modulator of T cell receptor signaling, also affects cell-to-cell variation of CD69 expression. The ability of microRNAs to control the uniformity of gene expression across mammalian cell populations may be important for normal development and for disease."

Biochemical and biophysical studies have shown that EPKs undergo multiconformational rearrangements in which the catalytic core is oscillating between open, intermediate, and closed conformations when active. Presently, the intramolecular interactions that regulate this dynamic process are not well understood. In this paper, we show how a set of conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions harmoniously regulate the active state mechanics. The electrostatic interactions involve the highly conserved salt bridge between the lysine from subdomain-II and glutamate from subdomain-III as well as an interaction between the activation loop and αC-helix. The hydrophobic interactions include the nonlinear motifs known as the Regulatory spine and Shell that traverse both lobes of the catalytic core. Furthermore, our findings show that the highly conserved “catalytic lysine” is not directly required for phosphoryl transfer but rather serves as a hub that aligns and positions the dynamic core elements required for catalysis."

Still, it has been shown that the connection patterns between pairs of neurons are not random. In contrast, there is evidence that the synaptic contacts between a pair of neurons cooperate: several experimental studies report either zero or about 3–6 synapses between neuron pairs. The mechanism by which the synapses cooperate, however, has not yet been identified. Here we propose a model for structural plasticity that relies on local processes at the dendritic spine. We combine and extend the previous models and determine the equilibrium probability distribution of synaptic contact numbers of the model. By optimizing the parameters numerically for each of three reference datasets, we obtain equilibrium contact number distributions that fit the references very well. We conclude that the local dendritic mechanisms that we assume suffice to explain the cooperative synapse formation in the neocortex."

However, the worm burdens are generally very light, so a beneficial effect of deworming on wasting malnutrition and anaemia in this age group which we have demonstrated was unexpected and the mechanism unclear. To investigate this, we have, for the first time, determined whether such worm infections in infants induce significant immune reactions which might be detrimental to nutrition and growth e.g. by inducing inflammation in the gut or by cytokine effects on erythropoiesis. We also determined if such responses are modulated by regular deworming over a 9 month period. Peripheral blood cells from infants infected with Ascaris and hookworms in particular responded to stimulation with worm antigens, producing predominantly Th2 cytokines. Although the Th2 cytokine responses in the periphery were not significantly altered by deworming, the levels of eosinophils, which are regulated by the Th2 cytokine, IL-5, were lower after treatment. It is possible that eosinophils play a role in gut pathology leading to wasting malnutrition and anaemia in the very young and that this effect is reduced by deworming."

We currently lack a universally accepted model of origin regulation that can explain the replication dynamics in complex eukaryotes. Here, we studied the mouse immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, one of the antibody-encoding portions of the genome, where origins change activity when antibody-producing B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. We show that multiple aspects of DNA replication initiation, progression, and termination can be explained mathematically by the interplay between randomly firing origins and two independent variables: the speed of progression of replication forks and the firing rate of origins along the locus. The rate of origin firing varies extensively along the locus during B cell differentiation and, thus, is a dominant factor in establishing the temporal order of replication. A differentiation factor called Pax5 can alter the temporal order of replication by modifying the rate of origin firing across various parts of the locus."

Since that time, the virus has become endemic in Asia, and has been the cause of outbreaks in Africa and Europe. Although many aspects of H5N1 virus biology have been studied in detail, surprisingly little is known about the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in its avian hosts (the length of time from infection until a bird becomes infectious, the duration of infectiousness, how many birds each infectious bird will infect). In this paper we show, using experimental transmission studies with unvaccinated and vaccinated chickens, that H5N1 avian influenza induces a short duration of infectiousness (∼2 days) and a very short period of time from infection until infectiousness (∼0.25 day) in unvaccinated chickens. Furthermore, while transmission was efficient among unvaccinated birds, no bird-to-bird transmission was observed in vaccinated chickens. Our results indicate that it may be difficult to curb outbreaks by vaccination after an introduction in a flock has been detected. On the other hand, preventive vaccination could be effective in preventing virus introductions and limiting the size of outbreaks."

Probably the most important advance in the search for new drugs was in vitro transformation of cercariae and their subsequent culture. However, hit identification in compound screenings is exclusively tested in skin stage parasites and is only confirmed for more mature worms in a subsequent step. This is in part due to the lack of an easy culture system for advance-stage parasites. We present here a reliable and highly standardized way to generate LiS worms in vitro in a cell-free culture system. The inclusion of in vitro drug tests on advanced-stage parasites in initial hit identification will help to identify compounds that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, the ability to continuously observe the parasite’s development in vitro will provide an important platform for a better understanding of its maturation in the human host. Taken together, this opens up new avenues to investigate the influence of specific cell types or host proteins on the development of Schistosoma mansoni and provides an additional tool to reduce animal use in future drug discovery efforts (3Rs)."

Certain proteins, believed to be only telomere-associated, engage DNA outside telomeres. This raises an interesting question. Does telomere length influence how telomere-binding proteins associate with DNA at regions distal from telomeres. If so, how does this impact function? Motivated by these questions, in the present studies we tested if extra-telomeric binding of the well-known telomere-repeat-binding-actor-2 (TRF2) depends on telomere length. Our results show that the level of DNA-bound TRF2 at telomere-distal sites changes as telomeres shorten or elongate. Consequently, TRF2-mediated gene regulation affects many genes. Notably, histone modifications that dictate chromatin compaction and access to regulatory factors, at sites distant from telomere ends also depended on telomere length. Together, this links the state of telomeres to gene regulation and epigenetics directly in ways not previously appreciated that might impact a more complete understanding of molecular processes underlying ageing and cancer."

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen that remains latent in the PNS and CNS of the infected host. The latency is unstable, and frequent reactivations of the virus are responsible for PNS and CNS pathologies. It is thus crucial to understand the physiological, immunological and molecular levels of interplay between latent HSV-1 and the host. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) control viral infections by preventing the onset of lytic infection. In previous studies, we showed a major role of PML NBs in favoring the establishment of a latent state for HSV-1. A hallmark of HSV-1 latency establishment is the formation of PML NBs containing the viral genome, which we called “viral DNA-containing PML NBs” (vDCP NBs). The genome entrapped in the vDCP NBs is transcriptionally silenced. This naturally occurring latent/quiescent state could, however, be transcriptionally reactivated. Therefore, understanding the role of PML NBs in controlling the establishment of HSV-1 latency and its reactivation is essential to design new therapeutic approaches based on the prevention of viral reactivation."

Different from the immunohistochemistry-based scoring practice, which focuses on a few selected marker proteins, immune deconvolution pipelines inform a previously untapped method to comprehensively reveal the tumor-infiltrating immune landscape. Recognizing the numerous strengths of existing immune deconvolution algorithms, here we show data outliers, which are inevitable in whole tissue sequencing data sets, substantially skew estimation results. Moreover, an estimate related to the absolute amount of each immune subset offers valuable insight into the nature of the host response in addition to percentage information alone. Thus, we engineered a new immune deconvolution pipeline, coined as Fast and Robust Deconvolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), to automatically detect and remove outliers prior feeding data into the deconvolution algorithm and to provide estimates related to the absolute quantity of each immune subset. Utilizing both synthetic and real data sets, we found that FARDEEP returns superior coefficients and offers a robust tool to reveal the immune landscape of human cancers."

Survival and replication of chlamydial species occur exclusively inside a host cell, and thus, gaining access to the protective intracellular niche is an absolute requirement. This report describes how the chlamydia protein TARP, which is secreted at the base of the bacteria and across the host membrane, acts as a scaffold to which host signaling proteins bind. This assembly of the complex of signaling proteins, which include Sos1, Abi1, Eps8, and Vav2 results in the remodeling of the host cytoskeleton to facilitate engulfment of the infecting chlamydia. We conclude that these proteins have a role in chlamydia based on a number of observations including their interaction with the TARP protein, their ability to switch on known signaling participants in chlamydia invasion, their localization at the site of chlamydia entry, and the inhibition of chlamydia invasion in their absence. Altogether, the data functionally link TARP with signaling pathways that function in chlamydial invasion, demonstrating the direct involvement of TARP in the invasion of host cells by C. trachomatis."

It has been long-held that IFN-γ is the principle effector of CD4 T cell-mediated resistance to Mtb infection, but Mtb-specific CD4 T cells produce low amounts of IFN-γ in vivo, leading to the possibility that increasing IFN-γ production by Th1 cells might enhance control of Mtb infection. However, the precise contribution of IFN-γ to CD4 T cell-dependent protection and the outcome of increasing IFN-γ production by CD4 T cells have not been evaluated. Here we show that IFN-γ accounts for only ~30% of the cumulative CD4 T cell-mediated reduction in lung bacterial loads over the first 1.5 months of infection. Moreover, we find that increasing the per capita production of IFN-γ by CD4 T cells leads to the early death of the host. Lastly, we show that suppression of CD4 T cell-derived IFN-γ by the inhibitory receptor PD-1 is essential to prevent lethal disease. Therefore, poor control Mtb infection does not result from defective production of IFN-γ, and strategies to selectively boost it are unwarranted. Furthermore, identifying the primary mechanisms of CD4 T cell-dependent control of Mtb infection should be a priority."

It is still unclear the extent to which the biofilm lifestyle and its associated phenotypes, such as hyper-tolerance to antimicrobial agents, can be attributed to structural characteristics of the biofilm community or to intrinsic biofilm-specific physiological programs. In order to address this longstanding question, we focused on poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG)–based biofilms, a clinically relevant phenotype of many bacterial pathogens, including E. coli. Instead of working in a biofilm-permissive genetic background, in which the timescale of biofilm formation is slow, we applied the functionally active secreted version of the PNAG exo-polysaccharide (sPNAG) to wild-type E. coli cells, generating robust biofilms on the timescale of hours. In this way, we managed to uncouple upstream regulatory processes and matrix preparatory phase of biofilm formation, focusing specifically on the latter part. By using a powerful genome-wide technology, we identified the genes and pathways involved in sPNAG-based biofilm formation. Our results revealed that structural interactions between sPNAG and surface structures such as lipopolysaccharides are the crucial determinants of biofilm formation and that multiple pathways including acid-tolerance, capsule biosynthesis, and regulation of cell morphology modulate this phenotype."

It mainly affects movement in elderly people and was traditionally considered a sporadic disease with no known cause. Discoveries of genes associated with familial PD (FPD) have demonstrated that PD pathogenesis can be significantly influenced by an individual's genetic makeup. Understanding the functions of these FPD genes will allow better understanding of the sporadic PD cases. PINK1 and Parkin are genes associated with FPD that affect patients at an early age. Mutations in PINK1 and Parkin lead to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, as a result of impairments of the mitochondrial quality control system. However, the mechanism of PINK1/Parkin action remains poorly understood. Here we show that PINK1 and Parkin act together to regulate Miro, a key component of the mitochondrial transport machinery, and that altered activities of PINK1 cause aberrant mitochondrial transport. Regulation of mitochondrial transport may be a critical aspect of the mechanisms by which the PINK1/Parkin pathway governs mitochondrial quality control. Dysfunction of this process could contribute to the loss of DA neurons, the cardinal feature of PD, as well as the peripheral neuropathy symptom associated with particular PINK1 or Parkin mutations."

Another goal is to predict disease risk for different individuals given their genetic sequence. Such predictions could either be used as a “black box” in order to promote changes in life-style and screening for early diagnosis, or as a model that can be studied to better understand the mechanism of the disease. Current methods for risk prediction have relatively poor performance, with one possible explanation being the fact they rely on a noisy ranking of genetic variants given to them as input. To improve the predictive power, we devised BootRank, a ranking method less sensitive to noise. We show that BootRank improves the ability to predict disease risk of unseen individuals in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data, and that combining BootRank with different classification algorithms improves performance compared to previous studies that used these data.

Here we describe the genes expressed when hookworm larvae make the transition from a developmentally arrested free-living form to a tissue-penetrating parasitic stage. Ancylostoma caninum can be “tricked” into thinking it has penetrated host skin by incubating free-living larvae in host serum – this is called “activation”. To comprehensively identify genes involved in activation, we used suppressive subtractive hybridization to clone genes that were up- or down-regulated in activated larvae, with a particular focus on up-regulated genes. The subtracted genes, as well as randomly sequenced (non-subtracted) genes from public databases were then printed on a microarray to further explore differential expression. We compared predicted gene functions between activated hookworms and the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, exiting developmental arrest (dauer), and found enormous differences in the types of genes expressed. Genes encoding secreted proteins involved in parasitism were over-represented in activated hookworms whereas genes involved in growth and development dominated in C. elegans exiting dauer. Our data implies that C. elegans dauer exit is not a reliable model for exit from developmental arrest of hookworm larvae. Many of these genes likely play critical roles in host-parasite interactions, and are therefore worthy of pursuit for vaccine and drug development."

In Drosophila fruit flies, infection with Spiroplasma symbionts often causes male-specific embryonic mortality, resulting in the production of all-female offspring. This striking phenotype is called “male-killing”, whose underlying mechanisms are of great interest. Here we investigated Drosophila melanogaster and its native Spiroplasma symbiont strain to understand how the host's molecular, cellular and morphogenetic pathways are involved in the symbiont-induced male-killing. Specifically in Spiroplasma-infected male embryos, pathogenic phenotypes including massive cell death throughout the body and neural malformation were observed. We unequivocally identified that the male-specific cell death preferentially occurs in the embryonic epithelium via the host's apoptotic pathway. Meanwhile, we found that, unexpectedly, the male-specific neural defects occur independently of host's apoptosis, suggesting that at least two different mechanisms may be involved in the Spiroplasma-induced male-killing. Also unexpected was the finding that Spiroplasma titers are almost constant throughout embryogenesis irrespective of sex despite the male-specific severe apoptosis.

These biofilms are an important component of pneumococcal epidemiology, particularly in influencing transmission, maintenance of asymptomatic colonization, and development of disease. The transcriptional program initiated via signaling of the competence pathway is critical for productive biofilm formation and is a strong contributor of pneumococcal infection and adaptation. In this study, we have identified BriC, a previously uncharacterized peptide that serves as a bridge between the competence pathway and biofilm development. We show that briC is induced by ComE, the master regulator of competence, and promotes biofilm development. Moreover, our studies in the murine model demonstrate that BriC is a novel colonization enhancer. Our studies of briC regulation capture an instance of genomic plasticity, where natural variation in the briC promoter sequence reveals the existence of an additional competence-independent regulatory unit. This natural variation may be able to modify the extent to which competence contributes to biofilm development and to nasopharyngeal colonization across different pneumococcal lineages. In summary, this study introduces a colonization factor and reveals a molecular link between competence and biofilm development."

This phenomenon mediated by cytoadhesion of infected-erythrocytes to host receptors in the microvasculature, contributes to the development of severe malaria. Although cytoadhesion to Endothelial Protein-C Receptor has a central role in severe malaria, other host receptors are also likely to be involved. Our results generated by the analysis of P. falciparum isolates from Mozambican patients and laboratory parasite lines indicate that a specific domain (DBLβ12) from DC8-type PfEMP1s can bind to the human receptor gC1qR, previously associated with severe malaria. Our findings revealed that antibodies against PfEMP1 could provide strain-transcending inhibition of gC1qR-binding.

M. tuberculosis has been affecting humans for millennia, suggesting that different strain lineages may be adapted to specific human populations. The combination of a particular strain lineage and its corresponding patient population can be classified as sympatric (e.g. Euro-American lineage in Europeans) or allopatric (e.g. East-Asian lineage in Europeans). We hypothesized that infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which impairs the human immune system, will interfere with this host–pathogen relationship. We performed a nation-wide molecular-epidemiological study of HIV–infected and HIV–negative TB patients between 2000 and 2008 in Switzerland. We found that HIV infection was associated with the less adapted allopatric lineages among patients born in Europe, and this was not explained by social or other patient factors such as increased social mixing in HIV–infected individuals. Strikingly, the association between HIV infection and less adapted M. tuberculosis lineages was stronger in patients with more pronounced immunodeficiency. Our observation was replicated in a second independent panel of M. tuberculosis strains collected during a population-based study in the Canton of Bern. In summary, our study provides evidence that the sympatric host–pathogen relationship in TB is disrupted by HIV infection."

Food collected by a small fraction of ants is distributed throughout the colony through a series of mouth-to-mouth interactions. An interesting interplay exists between food dissemination and food mixing within the colony. High levels of dissemination are important as they ensure that any food type is available to any ant. On the other hand, high dissemination induces homogenization which reduces the required variety of nutritional choices within the colony. Tracking fluorescent-labelled food and interpreting the results within the concepts of information theory, we show that food collected by each forager reaches almost every ant in the colony. Nonetheless, it is not homogenized across workers, resulting in a limited level of mixing. We suggest that the difference in food mixture held by each individuals can provide ants with the potential to control their nutritional intake by interacting with different partners."

These behaviours benefit all the individuals involved, and therefore, so the argument goes, their evolution is straightforward. However, mutualistic behaviours do pose a specific kind of evolutionary problem: they require the coordination of several partners. Indeed, a single individual expressing a preference for cooperation cannot benefit if others wish to remain solitary. Here we use simulations in evolutionary robotics to study the consequences of this problem. We show that it constitutes a far more serious obstacle for the evolution of cooperation than was previously thought on the basis of game theoretical analyses. We find that the transition from solitary to cooperative strategies is very unlikely, and we also observe that successful cooperation requires the evolution of a specific and rather complex behaviour, necessary for individuals to coordinate with each other. This reveals the critical role of the practical mechanics of behaviour in evolution."

We found that the rate of GCRs is elevated in mutants defective for shelterin components Taz1 or Rap1. Detailed genetic experiments revealed unexpectedly that Taz1 and Rap1 have a novel role in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and suppressing GCRs at non-telomeric regions. Given that shelterin components are conserved between fission yeast and humans, future studies are warranted to test whether shelterin dysfunction leads to genome-wide GCRs, which are frequently observed in cancers."

This movement of genes is called horizontal gene transfer, and it increases the prevalence of mobile genes in bacterial populations. However, it is not clear if donor host cells benefit from gene spread, or are simply exploited by selfish genes. Here, we show with both modelling and experiments that for the donor host, investing in the transfer of beneficial genes—such as those conferring antibiotic resistance—can be understood as an altruistic behaviour. This behaviour is costly to the donor but beneficial to recipients and can be selected for if a sufficient proportion of recipient cells share the donors’ transfer allele. Preferential transfer from donors towards recipients that share this allele occurs when dispersal is limited or if discrimination mechanisms are present. Our work suggests that both processes are likely to be widespread in nature, promoting horizontal gene spread by host donor cells. As many antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes are mobile, our work further implies that the spread of harmful traits among human pathogens may be modulated by host bacteria in a direction that depends on the bacterial ability to transfer the traits specifically to their kind."

Sepsis-induced immunoparalysis functionally impairs numerous lymphocyte populations, including NK-cells. However, the scope and underlying mechanisms of NK-cell impairment and the consequences for NK-cell-mediated pathogen control remain underappreciated. NK-cells contribute to early host control of pathogens through a balance of activating and inhibitory receptors, and alterations in the number and capacity of NK-cells to exert receptor-mediated immunity can lead to dramatic impairment in host control of infection. The present study defines sepsis-induced numerical and cell-intrinsic functional impairments in NK-cell response to cytokine stimulation and receptor signaling that contribute to impaired host capacity to mount NK-cell-mediated effector responses and provide protection to bacterial and/or viral pathogens. Impairments in receptor signaling were due to reduced expression of adaptor protein DAP12. Importantly, the diminished ability of NK-cells from CLP hosts to provide anti-viral (MCMV) immunity is partially restored by IL-2 complex (IL-2c) therapy, which increased the number, but not function, of protective Ly49H+ NK-cells. Thus, these findings define sepsis-induced changes of the NK-cell compartment and provide insight into potential therapeutic interventions aimed at resolving sepsis-induced immunoparalysis in sepsis survivors."

Defects in stem cell regulation can compromise tissue homeostasis and result in proliferative or degenerative diseases. Our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating the in vivo behavior of stem cells is still incomplete. The Drosophila central nervous system neural stem cells called neuroblasts have offered an excellent model system for uncovering key mechanisms and player involved in stem cell regulation. Previous genetic studies have uncovered the evolutionarily conserved Numb-N signaling pathway that regulates the self-renewal vs. differentiation choices of the cell fates of NSCs during their asymmetric division. Our understanding of how Numb-N signaling regulates NSC fate is still rudimentary. Recent studies have implicated the involvement of microRNAs in stem cell regulation in both mammalian and Drosophila systems. But the molecular mechanism and logic of miRNA action remain to be delineated. In this study we show that the bantam microRNA is a direct transcriptional target of the N signaling pathway, and that bantam feedback regulates N by negatively regulating the expression of Numb, an inhibitor of N. This feedback regulation of N helps maintain the robustness of NSC fate. We further show that bantam also impinges on a Numb-Myc axis of cell growth regulation, apparently in a N-independent manner. Together, our results highlight the importance of both transcriptional and translational control mechanisms in NSC regulation by the N signaling network. These findings have important implication for our understanding of the basic biology of NSCs and the therapeutic intervention of N-induced cancers."

The main feature of HSP is progressive stiffness of the lower limbs due to a dysfunction of nerve cells. We study HSP type 10, which is caused by mutations in the neuronal motor protein KIF5A. HSP type 10 is inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner, which means that patients have a normal and a mutated copy of the KIF5A gene. KIF5A plays an important role in neuronal function: it transports cargos to the synapse that can be up to 1 m from the cell body. We use the fruit fly as a model to investigate the role of mutations in KIF5A. Our fly model replicates a central feature of HSP: muscles that are activated by nerve cells that have long cellular processes are more severely impaired. We now address why one mutated copy of KIF5A is sufficient to cause HSP. To date, it has been thought that patients might have HSP because they have insufficient functional KIF5A or because mutated KIF5A disturbs the function of normal KIF5A. We provide evidence for the latter possibility."

One of these innovative approaches relies on the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the endosymbiont Wolbachia, since this bacterium can block the aforementioned viruses and interrupt transmission. Countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia have a strong co-occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in their urban landscapes. Therefore, Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are likely to lay their eggs in local breeding sites already colonized by wild uninfected conspecifics and/or Ae. albopictus larvae. We conducted experiments to study larval competition with varying larval densities, species proportions and food levels. Interestingly, Ae. albopictus proved to be a superior competitor under different scenarios: its larvae had superior survivorship, faster development rate and a higher performance index than Ae. aegypti (both infected and uninfected groups). The presence of Wolbachia increased larval survivorship of Ae. aegypti. Our data show that the population density of wild mosquitoes, especially interspecific competition, can become an additional force to reduce the pace of Wolbachia invasion in endemic regions."

The control of cell size is largely mediated by nutritional input signals via an evolutionarily conserved protein complex termed TORC1. In particular, TORC1 has been shown to sense the level of amino acids and its activity correlates with the level of amino acids present in the media. Yet, it is largely unknown how TORC1 senses amino acids. Here we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved Npr2/3 complex mediates the amino acid scarcity signal to TORC1. Cells lacking NPR2 and NPR3 genes fail to inactivate TORC1 when amino acids are scarce. Overactive TORC1 prevents these cells from adapting to an amino acid scarce environment, and, as a result, these cells are unable to proliferate in media that is not rich in amino acids. Artificially inhibiting TORC1 with rapamycin can completely rescue these defects. These results provide insight into how cells sense amino acid deficiency. Moreover, as deletions of NPR2 have been implicated in tumor growth, these results offer a fertile ground to study the role overactive TORC1 might play in those cancers."

Each option is usually accompanied with reward benefits (e.g., avoid traffic) and action costs (e.g., fuel consumption) that characterize the value of the option. The value and the availability of an option can change dynamically even during ongoing actions which compounds the decision-making challenge. How the brain dynamically integrates value information from disparate sources and selects between competing options is still poorly understood. In the current study, we present a neurodynamical framework to show how a distributed brain network can solve the problem of value integration and action selection in decisions with competing alternatives. It combines dynamic neural field theory with stochastic optimal control theory, and includes circuitry for perception, expected reward, effort cost and decision-making. It provides a principled way to explain both the neural and the behavioral findings from a series of visuomotor decision tasks in human and animal studies. For instance, the model shows how the competitive interactions between populations of neurons within and between sensorimotor regions can result in “spatial-averaging” movements, and how decision-variables influence neural activity and choice behavior."

Dendritic cells (DCs) play important roles in innate and adaptive immunity. A better understanding of how MVA is detected by innate immune sensors in DCs would guide the development of more effective MVA-based vaccines. We report our findings that MVA infection induces the production of type I interferon (IFN) in conventional dendritic cells via a cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway mediated by the newly discovered DNA sensor cGAS, its adaptor STING, and transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. By contrast, wild-type vaccinia virus fails to activate this pathway. Furthermore, we show that vaccinia virulence factors E3 and N1 play inhibitory roles in the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway."

Yet developing statistical methods for fitting models to epidemiological data is difficult. Epidemiological data is often noisy, incomplete, aggregated across different scales and generally provides only a partial picture of the underlying disease dynamics. Using nontraditional sources of data, like molecular sequences of pathogens, can provide additional information about epidemiological dynamics. But current “phylodynamic” inference methods for fitting models to genealogies reconstructed from sequence data have a number of major limitations. We present a statistical framework that builds upon earlier work to address two of these limitations: population structure and stochasticity. By incorporating population structure, our framework can be applied in cases where the host population is divided into different subpopulations, such as by spatial isolation. Our framework also takes into consideration stochastic noise and can therefore capture the inherent variability of epidemiological dynamics. These advances allow for a much wider class of epidemiological models to be fit to genealogies in order to estimate key epidemiological parameters and to reconstruct past disease dynamics."

Inter-species conservation of these TF binding sites (TFBS), and their statistical enrichment in sets of co-expressed genes, facilitates their large-scale prediction through computational sequence analysis. A major challenge in characterizing these putative TFBS is the identification of the proteins that bind them. We have developed a new approach to this problem by expressing random genomically encoded protein fragments as fusions to the capsid of bacteriophage T7. We select this diverse phage-display “library” for binding surface-immobilized instances of the TFBS in the form of short double-stranded DNA. This in vitro selection strategy leads to the enrichment of phage whose capsid-fusion peptides interact with the specific DNA sequence. Because each phage carries the DNA encoding the peptide fusion, the identity of the enriched phage can be determined through population-level PCR amplification of DNA inserts and their hybridization to DNA microarrays. Here, we show that this technology efficiently reveals the identity of proteins that bind known and novel predicted regulatory elements. Its application to a predicted yeast element (PAC) reveals Dot6 as one of its interaction partners, both in vitro and within the yeast nucleus."

However, existing models are derived exclusively from sub-cellular data under a variety of environmental conditions and species. These models tend to be exceedingly complex including hundreds of variables and parameters which make them difficult to validate and analyze. Using experimental data from one species (rabbit) under nearly identical physiological conditions, we developed a simple model of the electrical activity of a cardiac cell derived from sub-cellular, cellular, and tissue experimental data. This model reproduces cellular excitability and its recovery as well as several important “emergent” phenomena including beat-to-beat cellular alterations and unstable spiral waves. Under some conditions, unstable spiral waves in this model give rise to continuous formation of new spiral waves (i.e., “spiral wave breakup”) which is thought to be the underlying cause of cardiac fibrillation and sudden cardiac death."

We take advantage of the Caenorhabditis elegans germ cell system to explore DNA damage response defects associated with WRN, and we focus particularly on the role of wrn in the cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA replication blockage and ionizing radiation (IR). We show that WRN functions together with RPA upstream of C. elegans ATR in the intra S-phase checkpoint pathway, and upstream of C. elegans ATM and RPA in the cell cycle arrest pathway triggered by IR–induced double-strand DNA breaks. These functions of WRN in upstream DNA damage signaling are likely to be conserved, but not obvious in human systems due to functional redundancy."

Genome instability is one of the aging hallmarks and has long been implicated as one of the main causal factors in aging. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious DNA damages that cause genome instability. To counteract DNA damage of DSBs and maintain high level of genome integrity, cells have evolved powerful repair systems such as homologous recombination (HR). HR is crucial for DNA repair and genome integrity maintenance, and is generally believed to be essential for assurance of cell longevity. Telomeres, the physical ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes, are preferentially elongated by telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase, in most cases. However, due to the resemblance of telomeres to DSBs, HR can not be eliminated but rather readily takes place on telomeres, even in the presence of telomerase. Here we show that HR at yeast telomeres elicits genome instability and accelerates cellular aging. Inactivation of the evolutionarily conserved KEOPS complex subunit Cgi121 specifically inhibits telomere HR and results in extremely long lifespan, indicating a dark side of HR in longevity regulation."

Prior to their activation, these maternal mRNAs need to be “stored"" in the egg cytoplasm in a repressed but stable form. Surprisingly little is known about how the stored mRNAs are stabilized. The STAR family of RNA–binding proteins includes the C. elegans GLD-1, which controls many aspects of germ cell development. To obtain a comprehensive picture of GLD-1–dependent mRNA regulation, we performed a genome-wide survey of translational repression and mRNA stability of GLD-1 targets. This uncovered a potential role of GLD-1 in mRNA storage, as we found that GLD-1 both represses and stabilizes a subpopulation of its targets. The stabilization also involves a DDX6-like RNA helicase, CGH-1, which is a component of repressive germ granules and processing bodies. Remarkably, the GLD-1 and CGH-1 stabilized mRNAs encode regulators of the oocyte-to-embryo transition, providing an insight into how these functionally related mRNAs are specifically stabilized during germ cell formation. These findings have potential implications for oocyte quality and reproductive fitness, and for mRNA storage in other cell types such as neurons."

We found that this is complemented by a rapid pathogen-induced mucosal innate immune response that is essential to prevent excessive pathogenesis before adaptive immunity takes effect. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by the fact that it normally limits the duration during which the bacteria can induce epithelial lesions to the first 18 hours of infection. Later, luminal virulent bacteria can no longer induce new A/E lesions, but those induced already in the first 18 hours of infection persist through localized epithelial re-infection. Severity of the disease at the peak of infection is consequently shaped by the early events of the first 18 hours.

Intestinal cholinergic neuron targeting HcA account inhibition intestinal peristaltism secretion observed botulism , consequences targeting non - cholinergic neurons remains determined .","Botulism is a severe and often fatal disease in man and animals characterized by flaccid paralysis. Clostridium botulinum produces a potent neurotoxin (botulinum neurotoxin) responsible for all the symptoms of botulism. Botulism is most often acquired by ingesting preformed botulinum neurotoxin in contaminated food or after intestinal colonization by C. botulinum under certain circumstances, such as in infant botulism, and toxin production in the intestine. The first step of the disease consists in the passage of the botulinum neurotoxin through the intestinal barrier, which is still poorly understood. We investigated the trafficking of the botulinum neurotoxin in a mouse intestinal loop model, using fluorescent HcA (half C-terminal domain of the heavy chain). We observed that HcA preferentially recognizes neuroendocrine intestinal crypt cells, which likely represent the entry site of the toxin through the intestinal barrier, then targets specific neurons, mainly cholinergic neurons, in the submucosa, and later (90–120 min) in the musculosa leading to local paralytic effects such as inhibition of intestinal peristaltism. These results represent an important advance in the understanding of the initial steps of botulism intoxication and can be the basis for the development of new specific countermeasures against botulism."

In the presence of YPrA, IA3 folds itself into an amphipathic helix that blocks the active site cleft of the enzyme. We developed a multi-scaled approach to explore the underlying mechanism of this binding-induced ordering transition. Our approach combines a structure-based molecular dynamics model at the residue level with a stochastic path method at the atomic level. Our simulations suggest that IA3 inhibits YPrA through an induced-fit mechanism where the enzyme (YPrA) induces conformational change of its inhibitor (IA3). This expands the definition of an induced-fit model from its original meaning that the binding of substrate (IA3) drives conformational change in the protein (YPrA). Our result is consistent with recent kinetic experiments and provides a microscopic explanation for the underlying mechanism. We also discuss the important roles of non-native interactions and backtracking. These results enrich our understanding of the enzyme-inhibition mechanism and may have value in the design of drugs."

However, it is still not clearly understood how cooling suppresses epileptic activity. This study uses a computational approach to identify and investigate possible mechanisms. First, we used a neural mass model to reproduce epileptic discharge activity. Next, we simulate the effect of cooling by introducing temperature dependence in the model. Based from evidences reported from in vitro and in vivo studies, we formulated two temperature-dependent mechanisms that can reproduce the effect of cooling on the epileptic discharge activity. Parameter estimation of the model was performed using EEG recordings of focal brain cooling experiments with rats in vivo. Our model involves a synaptic mechanism that results in a reduced frequency of discharges and an intrinsic excitability mechanism that compensates such reduction in frequency of discharges resulting in persistent discharges during cooling but suppressed in magnitude. The temperature dependence is in the form of Q10 temperature coefficients which determine whether suppression or termination of epileptic discharges can be achieved."

For this random search problem, the Lévy walk hypothesis claims that Lévy walk movement patterns (i.e., each step length follows a distribution that is heavy-tailed) enable the searcher to capture more targets. However, most searchers may have antagonistic agents (e.g., predators) that can lead to death. Thus, the searcher needs to seek targets while avoiding encounters with antagonistic agents. Here, we show that the Lévy search strategy is less efficient in terms of total lifetime fitness when the predators are abundant, and especially when predators adopt a sit-and-wait strategy. Moreover, the results indicate that the life-cycle type of the searcher is an important fitness factor. These ecological aspects significantly influence the consequences of the random search. Therefore, it is critical to consider the ecological properties of searchers and other interacting agents when examining and estimating animal movements."

We exploited the inability of trypanosomes to engage in de novo purine synthesis as a therapeutic target. Cordycepin was selected from a trypanocidal screen of a 2200-compound library. When administered together with the adenosine deaminase inhibitor deoxycoformycin, cordycepin cured mice inoculated with the human pathogenic subspecies T. brucei rhodesiense or T. brucei gambiense even after parasites had penetrated into the brain. Successful treatment was achieved by intraperitoneal, oral or subcutaneous administration of the compounds. Treatment with the doublet also diminished infection-induced cerebral inflammation. Cordycepin induced programmed cell death of the parasites.

The parasites involved are flatworms of the genus Schistosoma. Unlike most non-parasitic flatworms, Schistosoma species have separate sexes, and the emergence of sex has been associated with the development of a parasitic lifestyle. The identification of gene products that are expressed in a sex-biased fashion permits the study of the origin of sexual dimorphism and, in the case of the schistosomes, the evolution of a human parasite. Here we investigated the differential expression of microRNAs in male and female individuals of the species Schistosoma mansoni. MicroRNAs are crucial gene regulators. We observed that many new microRNAs emerged in the evolutionary lineage leading to the schistosomes. However, many sex-biased microRNAs were present in the hermaphrodite ancestor of the flatworms, and therefore acquired sex-biased expression later on. Our results suggest that changes in microRNA expression patterns were associated with the emergence of separate sexes in the schistosomes."

We mined numerous virus segments from various grass genomes and assembled several defective pararetrovirus (non-autonomous PRV) species. We attempted to understand how these non-autonomous PRVs can complete parasitic life cycles in host plants. We determined that these non-autonomous PRV species have participated in interplay with autonomous PRVs or different non-autonomous PRV species. This interplay between different virus genomes has involved the exchange of noncoding regulatory sequences, which consequently evolved to be extraordinarily highly similar in different viruses within the same host. In non-autonomous PRVs, adaptive strategies to compensate for a lack of functionality have consequently involved concerted evolution of noncoding sequences establishing the partnerships."

These filamentous bacteria and related organisms inhabit the surface of marine and freshwater sediments, where they oxidize hydrogen sulfide using either oxygen or nitrate. In particular, conspicuously large marine representatives accumulate nitrate in vacuoles to survive anoxia, a unique feature among prokaryotes. Since nitrate-storing Beggiatoa are not available in pure culture, we amplified and sequenced the genomic DNA of single multicellular filaments. We comprehensively tested the incomplete sequence assemblies for foreign DNA. We show that the Beggiatoa genome encodes the pathways of chemolithoautotrophy but also appears to support the use of alternative electron donors and acceptors. We propose that vacuolar-type ATPases generate an electrochemical gradient to drive nitrate transport over the vacuole membrane, a mechanism similar to eukaryotic solute accumulation. Intriguingly, we found evidence for substantial gene exchange between Beggiatoa and cyanobacteria. In both phyla, hemagglutinins are possibly involved in filament formation. The breadth of storage and metabolic capabilities encoded in its genome enables Beggiatoa to act as a “rechargeable battery,” which glides between oxic and sulfidic zones to overcome non-overlapping availabilities of electron donors and acceptors."

The mechanisms and pathways by which ligands reach their binding sites in such cases are, thus, often unknown. Yet, ligand recognition by occluded cavities can happen rapidly. A central question remains: How does such a process occur? Experiments that provide insight at atomic resolution are currently lacking. In the current work, we have used a computational approach to capture the process by which a ligand, benzene, binds to a buried cavity in the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme. Using multiple long, unbiased atomistic simulations, we have discovered how benzene, starting from bulk solvent, finds and binds the solvent-inaccessible cavity. We find that there is no single dominant pathway. Rather, simulated trajectories discover multiple binding pathways with low activation barriers, facilitating a rapid recognition process. We highlight the role of subtle movements in helix positions in opening up multiple crucial paths for benzene to reach its binding cavity without the need for large-scale distortions of the protein structure, explaining the small activation energies."

However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, a process which has traditionally adopted a one-drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is astounding and the failure rate is daunting. The failure of the target-based drug discovery is in large part due to the fact that a drug rarely interacts only with its intended receptor, but also generally binds to other receptors. To rationally design potent and safe therapeutics, we need to identify all the possible cellular proteins interacting with a drug in an organism. Existing experimental techniques are not sufficient to address this problem, and will benefit from computational modeling. However, it is a daunting task to reliably screen millions of chemicals against hundreds of thousands of proteins. Here, we introduce a fast and accurate method REMAP for large-scale predictions of drug-target interactions. REMAP outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy, and has been successfully applied to drug repurposing. Thus, REMAP may have broad applications in drug discovery."

Thus, the interests of parasite and vector may well not be aligned and we can expect the parasite to exploit its vector just as it does with its main host, with consequent negative effects on the vector’s fitness. Here, we show that this occurs with Trypanosoma cruzi in its bug vector (T. cruzi causes Chagas disease, affecting ca. 8 million people and disease management is principally attained via vector control). Our results indicate that the parasites delay insect moulting, which is likely beneficial to them as they need time to develop in the insect before the next bloodmeal (that only occurs post-moult). We also show parasite-induced mortality over the narrow range of temperatures which the insect prefers and over which it performs best. In vitro growth of the parasite increases with temperature and we discuss how this may help explain the effects in vivo. Overall, these results will be important to understand the epidemiology of Chagas disease and provide an evolutionary context to explain the parasite′s interaction with its vector."

This potential can be predicted in various ways, and maximising it is one aim of experimental design. In this work we present a computationally efficient method of experimental design for model selection. We exploit the efficiency to consider the implications of the realistic case where all models are more or less incorrect, showing that experiments can be chosen that, considered individually, lead to unequivocal support for opposed hypotheses."

Convergent extension refers to the directed movement of cells that leads to the extension of tissue in one direction and narrowing of the tissue in the perpendicular direction. Often, convergent extension occurs in tissue which already contains distinct domains of gene expression such as segments, and it is unclear how these patterns are maintained despite extensive cell movement. Interestingly, experimental evidence suggests that these tissue patterns may drive rather than be compromised by convergent extension. However, existing computational models aimed at unravelling the mechanisms of convergent extension have thus far only studied the process in homogeneous tissues. With our model, we demonstrate that in a segmented tissue, preferential adhesion of cells to other cells within the same segment type is required to maintain the tissue pattern during convergent extension. Furthermore, such segment-specific adhesion is by itself capable of driving convergent extension."

In one of the most widespread such mechanisms, spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), the temporal order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking across a synapse determines whether it is strengthened or weakened. Therefore, the synapses are modified solely based on local information through STDP. However, STDP can give rise to a variety of global connectivity structures in an interconnected neural network. Here, we provide an analytical framework that can predict the global structures that arise from STDP in such a network. The analytical technique we develop is actually quite simple, and involves the study of two interconnected neurons receiving inputs from their surrounding network. Following analytical calculations for a variety of different STDP models, we test and verify all our predictions through full network simulations. More importantly, the developed analytical tool will allow other researchers to figure out what arises from any other type of STDP in a network."

PRS may be associated with diseases that may be related to or precursors of the underlying disease of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate how PRS can be used in concert with the medical phenome to better understand the etiology of disease subtypes nested within a broad disease classification. This is done by examining the shared and distinct genetic risk factors across the related but heterogeneous disease subtypes and also through our comparison of the secondary associations across the phenome corresponding to the subtype specific PRS. We consider several PRS construction methods in our study. This framework of analysis is enabled by access to electronic health records and genetics data. Leveraging and harnessing the rich data resources of the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, and the large population-based UK Biobank study, we investigated the primary and secondary disease associations with PRS constructed for the three most common types of skin cancer: melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma."

Symptomatic disease presentation ranges from a mild febrile disease with non-specific symptoms to severe forms, characterized by multi-organ failure, lung hemorrhage, and death. Factors driving severe outcomes remain unclear, but the host immune response likely plays an important role. In the present study, we applied high throughput techniques to identify the antibody profiles of patients with severe and mild leptospirosis. We discovered a limited number of immunodominant antigens, specific to patients. Surprisingly, we found the antibody repertoire varies in patients with different clinical outcomes and hypothesized that patients with mild symptoms were protected from severe disease due to pre-existing antibodies, while the profile of patients with severe outcomes was representative of a first exposure. These findings represent a substantial step forward in the knowledge of the humoral immune response to Leptospira infection, and we have identified new targets for vaccine and diagnostic test development."

They are tightly related to crop productivity in the first “green revolution.” GA triggers its responses by targeting DELLA proteins, the important repressors, for degradation. This process is believed to be regulated by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, but there are not any reports describing the identification of phosphatases regulating this critical event. By screening an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized Arabidopsis thaliana population, we identified a protein phosphatase TOPP4, a member of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), that acts as a positive regulator in the GA signaling pathway. TOPP4 promotes the GA-induced degradation of DELLA proteins by directly dephosphorylating these proteins. This study provides an important insight for the switch role of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in GA signal transduction and sheds light on PP1 protein phosphatases in regulating plant growth and development."

A prime example of this can be seen with the 163 genetic risk factors that have recently been associated with the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. For less than a handful of these 163 is the causative change in the genetic code known. The current study used an approach to directly look at the genetic code for a subset of these and identified a causative change in the genetic code for eight risk factors for ulcerative colitis. This finding is particularly important because it directs biological studies to understand the mechanisms that lead to this chronic life-long inflammatory disease."

This steep voltage dependence, which is essential to the propagation of nerve impulses, originates in the interaction between voltage-sensor domains of the ion channel and its pore. The voltage-sensor domains transmit voltage-driven conformational changes to the pore. To understand how this “electromechanical coupling” mechanism works, we have studied the protein–protein interfaces that connect the voltage sensors to the pore using bioinformatics, electrophysiological recordings, site-directed mutagenesis, and chemical cross-linking. We identify two functionally important interfaces: one links the mobile “voltage-sensor paddle” to the pore's gate near the intracellular membrane surface, while the other links an immobile region of the voltage sensor to the pore near the extracellular membrane surface. The two interfaces encompass only a small fraction of the voltage-sensor surface area, but appear to operate in unison to enable voltage-driven conformational changes within the voltage sensor so as to efficiently regulate the pore's gate."

Some effects of these hormones involve changes in gene expression and thus emerge slowly, over the course of hours or even days. Other responses to steroids occur rapidly and are independent of transcriptional regulation. Their functions and mechanisms of action are poorly understood, particularly in the context of steroid-mediated control of behavior. Here we show, using the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), that an unconventional, membrane-bound receptor for the molting hormone ecdysone transmits a novel form of steroid signaling in the adult brain. Our study shows that this novel form of steroid signaling has a robust interface with the classical “memory genes” that encode central components of the so-called cAMP signaling pathway, which is universally important for neuronal and behavioral plasticity. These findings underscore the significance of steroid signaling in memory processing, and provide a foundation for the genetic analysis of rapid, unconventional steroid signaling in behavioral regulation."

However, the in vivo function(s) of BCCIP and the mechanistic links between BCCIP's role in suppression of replication stress and mitotic errors are largely unknown. We generated transgenic mouse lines that conditionally express shRNA against the BCCIP, and we found an essential role of BCCIP in embryo development. We demonstrate that BCCIP deficiency causes the formation of a unique type of structural abnormality of chromosomes called sister chromatid union (SCU). It has been noted in the past that impaired homologous recombination and resolution of stalled replication forks can have detrimental consequences in mitosis. However, the physical evidence for this link has not been fully identified. SCU is the product of ligation between sister chromatids, likely formed as a result of unsuccessful attempt(s) to resolve stalled replication forks. Because the SCU will progress into chromatin bridges at anaphase, resulting in mitosis errors, it likely constitutes one of the physical links between S-phase replication stress and mitotic errors."

It represents a formidable public health problem that is expanding in both infection rates and geographical range. Fortunately, vaccines, improved diagnostics, innovative vector control approaches, and other disease control methods are under development. Despite the importance of dengue, there is substantial uncertainty about the magnitude of the disease burden and economic cost of dengue, particularly in the number of symptomatic dengue infections. There is substantial variation in national reporting systems for dengue, which hinders accurate estimates of total cases and, therefore, of economic burden. Here we suggest a combination of immediate, short-term, and longer term strategies to address this knowledge gap. Immediate strategies include, for example, documenting the number of ambulatory visits before and after hospitalization. Short-term recommendations include merging multiple data sources, such as cohort and surveillance data to improve estimates of dengue incidence. Long-term efforts include increasing the collection and analysis of seroprevalence and economic data, use of enhanced surveillance (e.g., use of incentives to improve reporting, include private sector sentinel sites). Implementing these steps would give policy makers more reliable, systematic data for strengthening and refining policies about the application and financing of new technologies to control dengue."

The colorful patterns on the wings of butterflies, in particular, offer an ideal system to investigate which genes and developmental mechanisms contribute to evolutionary diversification. Genetic analyses that try to find the position of genes along chromosomes are invaluable for such efforts, also because they allow researchers to compare chromosome content between species. Here, we report on a study which built a gene-based map for the chromosomes of a butterfly “lab rat” and identified chromosomes carrying color pattern genes. We compare our map to that of the reference lepidopteran species, the silkworm. Despite these species having diverged some 100 million years ago, there is much conservation in terms of which genes are found together in chromosomes and even how genes are ordered within chromosomes. However, because we were able to compare positioning of many more genes than had ever been reported before for this group, we also found evidence of several large- and small-scale chromosomal rearrangements. We discuss the advantages of gene-based maps in understanding the genetic basis of color pattern evolution."

Since infection during pregnancy often triggers prematurity, abortion, or stillbirth, we propose that understanding how these complications occur represent important prerequisites for improving the health of mothers and the developing fetus. Here we investigate the specific interaction between Listeria and a subset of immune-suppressive cells in the mother that expand to create and maintain a hospitable environment for the fetus. We find although Listeria, especially with highdosage infection, can invade the fetus, damage can also occur by infection-induced changes in maternal immune cells that make it markedly less hospitable for the fetus. Under these circumstances, maternal immune-mediated rejection causes fetal injury without direct pathogen invasion. We show this occurs using both reduced-dosages of virulent or weakened Listeria for infection. By comparing pregnancy outcomes and infection-induced changes in the mother that make it more or less hospitable for the fetus, we further demonstrate Listeria gaining entry inside infected cells is the critical factor for immune-mediated fetal injury. These results illustrating infection-induced changes in the mother that lead to fetal injury have important implications for designing new ways to improve the outcomes of pregnancy."

It has been reported that when CHIKV colonizes regions without previous circulation, it generally results in explosive human epidemics. In Panama, the first CHIKV infections were detected in May 2014. However, unlike many countries in the Americas, Panama presented with few autochthonous cases during the outbreak. In this study, we investigated the likely reason for the paucity of cases. Low vector infestation level, along with the surveillance programs, preparedness and early outbreak response possibly influenced the low number of cases observed during the Panamanian CHIKV outbreak."

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) in the last decade, thousands of tumours have been sequenced and their mutation profiles determined. However, the statistical analysis of these mutation profiles remains challenging. Indeed, two patients usually do not share the same set of mutations and can even have none in common. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish the few disease-causing mutations from the dozens, often hundreds of mutations observed in a tumour. To alleviate these challenges, it has been proposed to use gene-gene interaction networks as prior knowledge, with the idea that if a gene is mutated and non-functional, then its interacting neighbours might not be able to fulfil their function as well. Here we propose NetNorM, a method that transforms mutation data using gene networks so as to make mutation profiles more amenable to statistical learning. We show that NetNorM significantly improves the prognostic power of mutation data compared to previous approaches, and allows defining meaningful groups of patients based on their mutation profiles."

Migrating cells are guided by extracellular molecular cues, and cellular responses to these cues are regulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are proteins with long heparan sulfate polysaccharide chains attached. Here we identify and study previously unavailable viable mutants that disrupt the elongation of the heparan sulfate chains in the nematode C. elegans. Our analysis shows that these HS-chain-elongation mutations affect the development of the nervous system as they result in misguided migrations of neurons and axons. Furthermore, we find that heparan sulfate chain elongation occurs in numerous cell types during development and that the coordinated production of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in both the migrating cell and neighboring tissues, ensures proper migration. Our findings highlight the critical roles of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in nervous system development and the evolutionary conservation of the molecular mechanisms driving guided migrations."

However, a very rare and important subset of individuals termed elite suppressors is able to maintain HIV-1 plasma viral loads below the limit of viral detection in the absence of treatment. The reasons behind this ability to control the virus are poorly understood, but they likely involve both an effective host immune response against HIV-1 and factors related to the virus itself. Here, we analyze the function of the HIV-1 coat protein or envelope glycoprotein from a group of elite suppressors. HIV-1 envelope mediates entry into the host cell via interaction with the cellular receptors CD4 and CCR5. Envelopes from elite controllers interacted with these receptors inefficiently compared to those from individuals with detectable viral loads. These inefficient interactions by elite suppressor envelopes led to slow rates of entry into host cells. Envelopes from acutely infected individuals were not significantly different from elite suppressors or chronically infected individuals. These findings suggest that the decreased envelope efficiency may contribute to viral control in elite suppressors."

The protein, produced by many types of cells, is released in the blood. High levels of VEGF have been observed in different pathological conditions especially in cancer, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, identifying the genetic factors influencing VEGF levels is important for predicting and treating such pathologies. The number of genetic variants associated with VEGF levels has been limited. To identify new loci, we have performed a Genome Wide Association Study meta-analysis on a sample of more than 16,000 individuals from 10 cohorts, using a high-density genetic map. This analysis revealed 10 variants associated with VEGF circulating levels, 6 of these being novel associations. The 10 variants cumulatively explain more than 50% of the variability of VEGF serum levels. Our analyses have identified genes known to be involved in angiogenesis related diseases and genes implicated in platelet metabolism, suggesting the importance of links between this process and VEGF regulation. Overall, these data have improved our understanding of the genetic variation underlying circulating VEGF levels. This in turn could guide our response to the challenge posed by various VEGF-related pathologies."

As well as the deaths, snakebites result in a significant number of disabilities including permanent loss of limbs that alter the lifestyle of the victims. Snake venom is a mixture of different proteins with diverse functions; one of these major protein groups present in viper venoms are metalloproteases that primarily induce muscle damage. The mechanisms behind the development of snakebite (metalloprotease)-induced permanent muscle damage are poorly studied. Here, we have purified a metalloprotease (CAMP) from the venom of the Western diamondback rattlesnake, and characterised its function in mice. To determine the actions of CAMP in the development of permanent muscle damage, it was injected into the muscle of mice in a parallel comparison with cardiotoxin I (from the venom of the Red spitting cobra). The effects of these proteins on muscle regeneration were analysed at 5 and 10 days after injection. The results demonstrate that through a combination of effects on the structural scaffolds surrounding the tissues, blood vessels and regeneration, CAMP significantly affects the muscles, thereby leading to permanent muscle damage."

Here, we examine the role of the Arabidopsis exosome complex in such mechanisms. Evolutionarily conserved from archaea to humans, the exosome is a stable complex of RNase-like and RNA binding proteins that plays a central role in RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. Depletion of the exosome allows some repetitive sequences to escape from silencing. Most of these transcripts emanate from centromeric and pericentromeric chromosomal regions and other heterochromatic loci, and many derive from repetitive and transposable elements. In plants, TEs are targeted for de novo DNA methylation by smRNA–mediated pathways. However, we found that exosome depletion has only minor effects on smRNA populations that are acting in the main silencing mechanism in Arabidopsis, siRNAs–dependent DNA methylation RdDM. Instead, exosome depletion affects histone H3K9 dimethylation, an epigenetic mark that affects chromatin structure and thus alters transcription. Our data suggest that the exosome collaborates in gene silencing, likely acting in a parallel pathway to other mechanisms. We also propose that the Arabidopsis exosome may coordinate the transcriptional interplay of different RNA polymerases to modulate repression of some repetitive sequences."

While many studies have focused individually on either expression strength or protein sequence, in principle the fitness effects of these two protein properties are interdependent. We systematically investigated the fitness effects of both expression strength and protein sequence for the yeast Hsp90 gene (Hsp82). We analyzed the fitness effects of all possible point mutations in a putative substrate binding loop under seven different expression strengths. The fitness effects of amino acid substitutions were strongly dependent on expression strength. Many point mutations exhibited fitness defects at reduced expression strength that were hidden at the natural expression strength. Revealing these hidden mutant defects suggested that this region of Hsp90 contributes to a rate-limiting step in function, consistent with its putative role in substrate binding. This study is important because it indicates that critical regions in proteins are more prevalent than would be estimated based on experimental fitness analyses performed at natural expression strengths. As hidden fitness effects are likely to occur in other systems, these findings have broad implications for the field of experimental evolution."

Fully differentiated somatic cells arise from stem cells, with changes in gene expression that can be experimentally determined. If cancers arise as the result of an abruption of the differentiation process, then poorly differentiated cancers would have a gene expression more similar to stem cells than to normal differentiated tissue, and well differentiated cancers would have a gene expression more similar to fully differentiated cells than to stem cells. In this paper, we describe a novel computational algorithm that allows orientation of cancer gene expression between the poles of the gene expression of stem cells and of fully differentiated tissue. Our methodology allows the construction of a multi-branched phylogeny of human malignancies and can be used to identify genes related to differentiation as well as novel therapeutic targets."

While it was once believed to be isolated to these areas, recent research indicates the global burden on melioidosis is growing. Furthermore, treatment of melioidosis is difficult because of the high occurrence of disease relapse and increasing antibacterial resistance. Recent research suggests that immunomodulation via COX-2 inhibition to subsequently reduce with PGE2 production is an effective therapeutic strategy for melioidosis. The current study was built on this immunomodulatory principle by using an orally administered COX-2 inhibitor and evaluating its effects on the COX-2 and NF-ĸB pathways. We also investigated whether the conjunctive therapies of immunomodulation and antibiotics increased efficacy of the treatment. We confirmed immunomodulation is effective as a post-exposure therapeutic in BALB/c mice. More importantly, we found that conjunctive post-exposure treatment via immunomodulation increased antibacterial treatment efficacy. Conjunctive therapy may prove efficacious for other infectious diseases resembling melioidosis. Hence, further research is needed to identify the long-term effects of the described treatment(s) across multiple animal models."

As expected, chemoreceptor expression is enriched in chemosensory neurons. Putative chemoreceptors are also expressed in a wide range of interneurons and motor neurons, as well as non-neuronal cells, suggesting that these receptors may sense internal cues in addition to environmental signals. Each chemoreceptor is expressed sparsely, often in just one neuron type, but each neuron type can express many chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptor expression is remarkably plastic, particularly in the context of the environmentally induced dauer diapause stage. Taken together, this molecular atlas of chemosensory receptors provides an entry point for functional studies and offers a host of markers for studying neuronal patterning and plasticity."

RNA-binding proteins bind directly to double- or single-stranded RNA and regulate many cellular processes. Here, we address how proteins evolve new RNA-binding functions by using as a model system a fungal mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that evolved to acquire a novel function in splicing group I introns. Group I introns are RNA enzymes (or “ribozymes”) that catalyze their own removal from transcripts, but can become dependent upon proteins to stabilize their active structure. We show that the C-terminal domain of the synthetase is flexibly attached and has high non-specific RNA-binding activity that likely pre-dated the evolution of splicing activity. Our findings suggest an evolutionary scenario in which an initial non-specific interaction between an ancestral synthetase and a self-splicing group I intron was fixed by an intron RNA mutation, thereby making it dependent upon the protein for structural stabilization. The interaction then evolved by the acquisition of adaptive mutations throughout the protein and RNA that increased both the splicing efficiency and its protein-dependence. Our results suggest a general mechanism by which non-specific binding interactions can lead to the evolution of new RNA-binding functions and provide novel insights into splicing and synthetase mechanisms."

This impacts our ability to design effective interventions to combat resistance. From a public health point of view, multidrug resistance is particularly problematic because resistance to different antibiotics is often seen on the same bacterial strains, which leads to high frequencies of multidrug resistance and limits treatment options. This work seeks to explain this trend in terms of strain ecology and the competition between strains with different resistance profiles. Building on recent work exploring why resistant bacteria are not out-competing sensitive bacteria, we show that models originally proposed to explain this observation also predict high multidrug resistance frequencies. These models are therefore a unifying explanation for two pervasive trends in resistance dynamics. In terms of public health, the implication of our results is that new resistances are likeliest to be found on already multidrug resistant strains and that changing patterns of prescription may not be enough to combat multidrug resistance."

Recombination events in mammals are not randomly positioned along the chromosomes but occur in preferential 1–2-kilobase sequences termed hotspots. Different species such as humans and mice do not share hotspots, although the same principles almost certainly regulate their placement in the genome. Hotspot positions and activities depend on genetic background and show sex-specific differences. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of recombination activity along the largest mouse chromosome, finding that recombination is regulated on multiple levels, including regional positioning relative to the chromosomal ends, local gene content, sex-specific mechanisms of hotspot recognition, and parental origin.

We show that Drosophila larvae crawl away from places that smell like the main parasitoid enemies, Leptopilina wasps. Furthermore, Drosophila adult females avoid laying eggs at those places. This avoidance is mediated via a highly specific olfactory sensory neuron type that is tuned to detect three odors of the parasitoid, including the wasps sex pheromone iridomyrmecin. We identify the neuron type, the receptors, and the odor ligands that mediate this behavior and also show that this neuronal system is both necessary and sufficient to govern the parasitoid avoidance behavior.

Since pRb’s first description as a transcriptional repressor of genes important for cell cycle progression, many more functions have been elucidated, e.g. in developmental decisions and genome integrity. Homologs of human pRb have been identified in most eukaryotes, including plants, indicating an ancient evolutionary origin of pRb-type proteins. We describe here the first genome-wide DNA-binding study for a plant pRb protein, i.e. RBR1, the only pRb homolog in Arabidopsis thaliana. We see prominent binding of RBR1 to the 5’ region of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, chromatin organization and DNA repair. Moreover, we also reveal extensive binding of RBR1 to specific classes of DNA transposons. Since RBR1 is involved in a plethora of processes, our dataset provides a valuable resource for researches from different fields. As an example, we used our dataset to successfully identify new genes necessary for growth upon DNA damage exerted by drugs such as cisplatin or the environmentally prevalent metal aluminum."

A number of genes encoding contractile apparatus-related proteins undergo muscle-specific pre–mRNA processing. However, the molecular mechanisms and consequences of muscle-specific alternative pre–mRNA processing remain largely unknown. In this study, we reveal regulation mechanisms of pre–mRNA processing of the unc-60 gene locus, encoding two tissue-specific isoforms of ADF/cofilin in C. elegans. The unc-60A and unc-60B genes share only the first exon, and UNC-60B protein is specifically expressed in muscle. We visualize the tissue-specific processing patterns of the unc-60 pre–mRNA with green and red fluorescent proteins in living worms. We provide genetic, biochemical, and immunohistochemical evidence that muscle-specific RNA–binding proteins ASD-2 and SUP-12 cooperatively bind to specific motifs in intron 1A to retain intron 1A, which leads to skipping of exon 2A through 5A and splicing between exon 1 and 2B. Consistently, disruption of the splicing factors leads to expression of UNC-60A in muscle and suppresses paralysis of an unc-60B-specific mutant. Our study raises a model of step-by-step execution of complex co-transcriptional pre–mRNA processing and provides insight into the fate decision of the entire transcript."

These signals can be genetic, epigenetic or environmental, thereby resembling the extreme variation in signals for sex determination across multicellular animals. We show that common developmental pathways downstream of these input signals, including the conserved sex differentiation gene doublesex, regulate sex and caste-specific phenotypic differentiation in the ant species Cardiocondyla obscurior. Many different mechanisms of gene regulation have been implicated in controlling caste-specific development in social insects but these all depend on a higher-level genetic switch. We propose that highly conserved hub genes such as dsx, which can translate variable input signals into large transcription differences using intermediate-level regulators, are tightly linked with the repeated evolutionary transition to eusociality and caste polyphenism."

The formation of MVBs is unique in that the curvature is directed toward the lumen of the compartment rather than the cytosol. During MVB formation, the curvature-inducing proteins, such as clathrins, could not be involved in the inward invagination of the endosomal membrane. Under these circumstances, lipids have been assumed to play a role in the membrane invagination step by creating local membrane environments; however, the lipids involved in this step have not been fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that cholesterol, an essential membrane component in animals, is critical for MVB formation and function. We found that disruption of OSBP–related proteins (ORPs), which have been proposed to function in cellular cholesterol distribution and metabolism, reduces the cholesterol content in late endosomes/lysosomes, leading to impaired MVB function. MVB sorting pathway is known to be involved in many processes, including growth factor receptor down-regulation, exosome secretion, antigen presentation, the budding of enveloped viruses, and cytokinesis. Our findings provide a novel link between cholesterol and these biologically important functions."

Unfortunately, predicting the impact of a non-coding DNA alteration remains extremely difficult. In this study, we analyze millions of non-coding cancer mutations and show cancer-specific mutational patterns can be used to predict non-coding regions that are preserved from mutations and may thus be important for cancer cell survival. Combining this information with population data, we propose a new scoring system that should help prioritize important non-coding mutations in future studies."

When we correlated the chromatin status to transcriptional activities in actively growing cells we found that the silenced SM gene clusters are flanked by heterochromatic domains presumably contributing to silencing but that the bodies of the clusters only carry background levels of any of the investigated marks. In nutrient-depleted conditions, activating marks were invading some, but by far not all transcribed clusters, leaving open the question how activation of these regions occurs at the chromatin level. Surprisingly, a large number of these gene clusters actually depend on KdmB for normal activation and it will be interesting to see in future how this protein thought to mainly act as repressor by removing positive H3K4m3 marks switches gears to activate transcription directly or indirectly."

Two bacterial factors, MgtC and OprF, recently discovered to be involved in the intramacrophage survival of P. aeruginosa, appeared to play a role in this cytotoxicity caused by intracellular bacteria. We provided evidence that type III secretion system (T3SS) gene expression is lowered intracellularly in mgtC and oprF mutants.

We thus describe a transient intramacrophage stage of P. aeruginosa that could contribute to bacterial dissemination."

It has been recently shown that maintaining the balance of the inflammatory responses via dampening M1-type myeloid cell activation is critical to guarantee control of the parasites and survival of the host. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-27 receptor-deficient (IL-27R-/-) mice infected with African trypanosomes developed an excessive inflammatory response and severe liver immunopathology, resulting in dramatically reduced survival, as compared to infected wild-type mice. The early mortality of infected IL-27R-/- mice was correlated with significantly elevated secretions of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ, and enhanced activation of CD4+ Th1 cells. Importantly, IL-10 production was not impaired in infected IL-27R-/- mice. Either depletion of CD4+ T cells, resulting in a dramatically reduced secretion of IFN-γ, or neutralization of IFN-γ, prevented the early mortality of infected IL-27R-/- mice with a significantly reduced inflammatory response and a major amelioration of the liver pathology. Thus, our data identify IL-27 signaling as a novel pathway to prevent the early mortality via inhibiting hyperactivation of CD4+ Th1 cells and their excessive secretions of IFN-γ during experimental infection with extracellular protozoan parasites African trypanosomes."

Transpositions of transposable elements in both somatic and gametic cells can be transmitted to the next generation. As a result, plant genomes may contain transposable elements exhibiting a variety of tissue-specific activities. Thus far, the spatio-temporal activity of LTR retrotransposons, the most abundant class of transposable elements in plants, has not been well characterized. Here, we report a detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal transposition pattern of a plant LTR retrotransposon in the endogenous system. Using the model legume Lotus japonicus, we found that LORE1a, a member of the chromovirus LORE1 family that belongs to the Gypsy superfamily, was epigenetically de-repressed via tissue culture. Activation was stochastic and derepression was maintained in regenerated plants. This feature made it possible to trace the original spatio-temporal activity of the retrotransposon in the intact plants. We determined that the plant chromovirus retrotransposes mainly in the male germline, without obvious insertional preferences for chromosomal regions. This finding suggests that the tissue specificity of transposable elements should be taken into account when considering their impact on the host genome dynamics and evolution."

Here, we demonstrate that a histone modification—H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), which is mediated by the enzyme SET-domain-containing 2 (SETD2) and regulates gene expression—plays an essential role in MSC lineage commitment in the bone marrow. We deleted the Setd2 gene in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in mice and found that these mice exhibited reduced bone formation and increased marrow fat accumulation. Notably, we identified Lbp as one of SETD2 functional downstream genes. Overexpression of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) could partially rescue the phenotype of SETD2 deficiency in bone marrow stem cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that H3K36me3 could regulate Lbp transcription by modulating its transcriptional initiation and elongation. Thus, our study provides a new mechanism for MSC fate determination and a therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoporosis."

The sensitivity of these responses depends upon strong repression of flowering under inappropriate conditions. FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) are related transcription factors that act in concert to strongly inhibit flowering in crucifer plants through repressing transcription of their target genes. Many direct FLC/ SVP targets have been identified in genome-wide studies, however few of these genes have been characterized for their roles in regulating flowering time or other aspects of reproductive development. Here, we characterize TARGET OF FLC AND SVP1 (TFS1) as a novel target of FLC and SVP, and demonstrate that TFS1 contributes to proper flowering-time control. Moreover, we provide a detailed mechanistic view of how TFS1 transcription is controlled during reproductive development through the repressive activity of FLC/SVP being overcome by the transcriptional activator SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1. Thus we further elucidate the network of genes repressed by FLC/SVP to block flowering and determine mechanisms by which their repressive activity is overcome during the initiation of flowering."

However, molecular mechanisms underlying such an increased maternal susceptibility to pathogens during pregnancy remain to be further understood. Here we show in pregnant women that increased progesterone levels are associated with IFN-γ gene hypermethylation and reduced IFN-γ production in peripheral CD8 Tm cells. By using murine models of LM infection, for the first time we show a causal relationship between increased level of progesterone, a characteristic female sex hormone of pregnancy, and increased susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular bacterium that endangers both the pregnant and the fetus. Such an impact on anti-listeria host defense is mediated through progesterone-induced IFN-γ gene hypermethylation in CD8 Tm cells, resulting in impaired IFN-γ production and reduced immune protection by antigen-non-specific CD8 Tm cells. This study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens during pregnancy."

The circadian clock governs day and night 24 h periodic molecular processes and physiological behaviors, while cell cycle controls cell division process. It has been widely observed that cell division does not occur randomly across day and night, but instead is normally confined to specific times during day and night. These observations suggest that cell cycle events are gated by the circadian clock. Regarding the biological benefit and rationale for this intriguing gating phenomena, it has been postulated that circadian gating helps to maintain genome stability by confining radiation-sensitive cell cycle phases to night. Bearing in mind the facts that global transcriptional inhibition occurs at cell division and transcriptional inhibition shifts circadian phases and periods, we postulate that confining cell division to specific circadian times benefits the circadian clock by removing or minimizing the side effects of cell division on the circadian clock. Our results based on computational simulation in this study show that periodic transcriptional inhibition can perturb the circadian clock by altering circadian phases and periods, and the magnitude of the perturbation is clearly circadian phase dependent. Specifically, transcriptional inhibition initiated at certain circadian phases induced minimal perturbation to the circadian clock. These results provide support for our postulation. Our postulation and results point to the importance of the effect of cell division on the circadian clock in the interaction between circadian and cell cycle and suggest that it should be considered together with other factors in the exploitation of circadian cell cycle interaction, especially the phenomena of circadian gating of cell cycle."

In our present study, we have discovered that genetic ablation, or pharmacological inhibition, of group-I (i.e. activating) metabotropic glutamate receptors is beneficial against prion neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Mice treated with these inhibitors exhibited impressive suppression of neurological signs and a delayed onset of the symptoms. These results further suggest that activation of these metabotropic glutamate receptors is a downstream event of prion replication and targeting these receptors could be a therapeutic option to alleviate the neurological symptoms, thereby ameliorating the quality of life in patients having prion infection."

An understanding of the wide spectrum of physiological stimuli that can trigger this beneficial cellular mechanism is only just starting to emerge. However, this process also has a negative side, since autophagy is exploited in certain pathological conditions, including cancer, to extend the lifespan of cells that would otherwise die. Our analysis of a new zebrafish mutant, titania (ttis450), with defective digestive organs and abnormal craniofacial structure, sheds further light on the physiological and pathological ramifications of autophagy. In (ttis450), an inherited mutation in a gene required for ribosome production provides a powerful stimulus to autophagy in affected tissues, allowing them to evade cell death. The phenotypic consequences of impaired ribosome biogenesis in our zebrafish model are reminiscent of some of the clinical features associated with a group of human syndromes known as ribosomopathies."

Our study suggests that the patterns of DENV spread result from the interplay between intensity and structure of human mobility through the air transportation network."

With no vaccines available, prevention heavily depends on controlling household-infesting triatomines. Insecticide-spraying campaigns have effectively reduced incidence, but persistent household reinfestation can result in disease re-emergence. What, then, is the best strategy to keep houses free of triatomines and thus interrupt disease transmission in the long run? We reviewed published evidence to (i) assess the effectiveness of insecticide-based vector control, gauging the importance of reinfestation; (ii) compare the efficacy of programme-based (with households periodically visited by trained staff) and community-based (with residents reporting suspect vectors found in their homes) surveillance strategies; and (iii) evaluate the performance of alternative vector-detection methods. The results confirm that insecticide-based vector control is highly effective, but also that persistent house reinfestation is a general trend across Latin America. Surveillance systems are significantly more effective when householders report suspect bugs than when programme staff search houses, either manually or using vector-detection devices. Our results clearly support the view that long-term vector surveillance will be necessary for sustained Chagas disease control – and that community participation can substantially contribute to this aim."

The pathogenesis of this neglected tropical disease involves the production of a toxin, mycolactone, which spreads through the tissues, away from the infecting organisms. Mycolactone has pleiotropic effects on fundamental cellular processes, resulting in pronounced cytotoxicity and immunosuppressive effects that together drive progressive ulceration. The molecular mechanisms underlying its cellular effects have been partly deciphered, but multiple cellular targets have been identified. A literature survey revealed that most of the identified targets of mycolactone are membrane receptors residing in particular domains of the plasma membrane. Despite its lipid-like nature, mycolactone has been shown to be intracellular, implying that it can cross the plasma membrane. We describe here a surprising membrane-reshaping effect of mycolactone due to effects on lipid domain formation. By reversing lateral lipid segregation, mycolactone may disrupt the formation of domains with well-established roles in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways. This remodeling of the cell plasma membrane may underlie the molecular events enabling mycolactone to attack multiple targets."

Failure of components of the complex protein synthesis machinery underlies a growing list of inherited and acquired multi—organ syndromes referred to as ribosomopathies. While ribosomes, the critical working components of the protein synthesis machinery, are required in all cell types to translate the genetic code, only certain organs manifest clinical symptoms in ribosomopathies, indicating specific cell-type features of protein synthesis control. Further, many of these diseases result in cancer despite an inherent deficit in growth. Here we report a range of consequences of protein synthesis insufficiency with loss of a broadly expressed ribosome factor, leading to growth impairment and cell cycle arrest at different stages. Apparent induction of p53-dependent cell death and arrest pathways included apoptosis in the fetal brain and senescence in the mature exocrine pancreas. The senescence, considered a tumour suppression mechanism, was accompanied by the expression of biomarkers associated with early stages of malignant transformation. These findings inform how cancer may initiate when growth is compromised and provide new insights into cell-type specific consequences of protein synthesis insufficiency."

This computation is known as dead reckoning or path integration. A                    discovery made three years ago in rats focused attention on the dorsolateral                    medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) as a location in the rat's brain where                    this computation might be performed. In this area, so-called grid cells fire                    whenever the rat is on any vertex of a triangular grid that tiles the plane.                    Here we propose a model that could generate grid-cell-like responses in a neural                    network. The inputs to the model network convey information about the                    rat's velocity and heading, consistent with known inputs projecting                    into the dMEC. The network effectively integrates these inputs to produce a                    response that depends on the rat's absolute position. We show that such                    a neural network can integrate position accurately and can reproduce                    grid-cell-like responses similar to those observed experimentally. We then                    suggest a set of experiments that could help identify whether our suggested                    mechanism is responsible for the emergence of grid cells and for path                    integration in the rat's brain."

Diagnosing this disease is difficult, requiring special techniques that are often not readily available. As the actual impact of scrub typhus on the population and its geographical distribution remains unknown, we searched systematically for available information in medical databases. Scrub typhus is common: more than every fifth person in areas where scrub typhus occurs carry antibodies as a sign of previous contact. All countries with an established surveillance system have recorded an increase in scrub typhus cases over the past 8–10 years, while reports from South America and Africa suggest a wider distribution beyond Asia. Scrub typhus is a serious disease: approximately 6% of cases die if untreated, and 1.5% if treated, but mortality can reach 13% in areas where the usual treatment does not always work well. Death rates of complications are higher, reaching 14% in brain infections, 24% with multiple organ failure, and pregnancies with scrub typhus can have poor outcomes, with high miscarriage rates. Despite many limitations on the amount and quality of available reports, we found that scrub typhus is a severely underappreciated tropical disease, affecting mainly rural populations, but increasingly urban areas as well."

Significantly, the structure of the intracellular calcium store is modelled for the first time. The model is shown to reproduce calcium dynamics in control cells in both normal and abnormal conditions, demonstrating its suitability for future investigation of structure-function relationships. Thus, the model presented provides a powerful tool for the direct integration of experimentally acquired structural data in healthy and diseased cells and assessment of the role of structure in regulating normal and abnormal calcium dynamics."

Endosomes sort cargo, such that some cargos are sent to the lysosome for degradation, while others are recycled to the plasma membrane. Small GTPase proteins of the Rabs family are master regulators of endosomes, functioning by acting as molecular switches. As cargo moves through the endosomal system, it must pass from the domain controlled by one Rab-GTPase to the domain controlled by another. Little is known about how transitions along the recycling pathway are controlled. Here we analyze a group of protein interactions that act along the early-to-recycling pathway. Our work shows that RAB-5 deactivation mediated by TBC-2 and its recruiters RAB-10 and AMPH-1 is important for cargo recycling. This work provides mechanistic insight into how Rab proteins controlling different steps of trafficking interact during endocytic recycling."

Similar to viral replication that greatly depends on subverted cellular proteins, viral genetic recombination is also affected by host factors based on genome-wide screens with tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) in yeast model host. However, the roles of host factors in the viral genomic RNA recombination process remain elusive. In this paper, we show evidence, in yeast, plants and in vitro, that co-opted cellular helicases by TBSV affect viral recombination through suppressing template-switching and replication of the new recombinant viral RNAs. Based on the presented data, a new concept emerges on the roles of co-opted cellular helicases in maintaining viral genome integrity. Altogether, the hijacked cellular DEAD-box helicases are involved in maintenance of full-length viral RNA genome and suppression of viral RNA recombination, thus blocking the appearance of defective or recombinant viral RNAs during replication."

The pathology of schistosomiasis is caused mainly by host immune responses to parasite eggs and due to the formation of granulomas in liver and other tissues. There is no vaccine for schistosomiasis and treatment relies essentially on a single drug, Praziquantel. However, reduced susceptibility of schistosome isolates to Praziquantel has been reported, raising serious concerns about the need to develop new drugs against schistosomes. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) control many cellular and developmental processes and they are important targets in cancer therapy. In this paper, we have investigated the possibility to fight schistosomes by targeting with a single drug, insulin receptors (IRs) involved in parasite growth and metabolism and Venus Kinase Receptors (VKRs) which are unusual IR-like RTKs expressed in the parasite reproductive organs of Schistosoma mansoni. Diverse RTK inhibitors have been tested on kinase activities of these RTKs. The well-known IR inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1024, was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of both S. mansoni VKRs and IRs, able to induce in vitro death of larvae and adult worms at micromolar doses.

Onset of AMD is due to local production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes formation of new blood vessels in the retina, thereby leading to retinal tissue destruction and blindness. Since a clinical study by us showed that AMD patients have high amounts of antibodies to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), we postulated that infection with HCMV might be a risk factor for AMD. To investigate this possibility, mice were infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), and at various times after infection, subjected to laser treatment of the eye to induce choroidal neovascularization, an experimental model of AMD. Most severe CNV developed in mice with chronic MCMV infection, a time when MCMV gene sequences could not be detected within eye tissues. However, splenic macrophages collected from mice with chronic MCMV infection produced high levels of gene transcripts to several pro-angiogenic factors including VEGF. MCMV infection of mouse macrophages in culture also produced high amounts of VEGF. Stimulation of VEGF production in vivo and in vitro was sensitive to antiviral treatment. Chronic HCMV infection may therefore promote AMD by stimulation of VEGF production by activated macrophages."

Although theoretical analysis might solve this problem, it is often difficult to precisely determine parameters for signaling gradients and kinetics of signaling molecules. In the present study, we developed a parameter-free method for determining a Boolean function for understanding a complex signaling system using gene expression patterns of signaling molecules and geometrical configurations of individual cells within the embryo. In the ascidian embryo, four signaling ligands, Ephrin-A.d (Efna.d), Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r, coordinately induce Otx expression in the neural lineage at the 32-cell stage. In addition to determining a Boolean function, our method determined sensing patterns, which represented whether or not individual cells received sufficient amounts of the signaling molecules. The sensing patterns predicted that differential expression of Otx in the neural lineage is primarily determined by Efna.d, but not by differential inputs of Fgf9/16/20, Admp, and Gdf1/3-r. We confirmed this prediction by an experiment. As a result, we found that only Efna.d signaling pathway is differentially activated between ectodermal cells and the remaining signaling pathways are activated in all ectodermal cells at similar levels."

This success is often attributed to their complex colony organization. Each individual is thought to specialize in a particular task and thus become an “expert” for this task. Researchers have long assumed that the ecological success of social insects derives from division of labor, just as the increase in productivity achieved in human societies; however, this assumption has not been thoroughly tested. Here, I have measured task performance of specialized and unspecialized ants. In the ant species studied here, it turns out that specialists are no better at their jobs than generalists, and sometimes even perform worse. In addition, most of the work in the colony is not performed by the most efficient workers. So the old adage “The Jack of all trades is a master of none” does not seem to apply to these ants, suggesting that we may have to revise our understanding of the benefits of colony organization."

We elucidated environmental correlates of plague occurrences by way of ecological niche modeling techniques utilizing advanced satellite imagery and geospatial datasets to better understand the ecology and geography of the transmission of plague. Our analysis indicates that plague foci in Brazil are indeed insular as previously suggested. Furthermore, distribution of such foci are likely not directly dependent on elevation, and rather are contigent on climate and vegetation. Seasonality of zoonotic plague transmission is linked to variations of these ecological parameters- particularly the increase in precipitation and primary production of the rainy season. Spatial analysis of transmission events afford a broad view of potential plague foci distributions across northeastern Brazil and indicate that the epidemiology of plague is driven by a dynamic array of environmental factors."

Currently there are no vaccines or prophylactic drugs available to prevent contraction of the disease. Consequently vector control is the only method of disease prevention. In many areas, especially those lacking high densities of cattle, the only control option for routine use against tsetse flies are insecticide-treated targets or biconical traps. However, these methods in their current form are often too expensive for routine use against the riverine tsetse species that are the major vectors of sleeping sickness. Our aim is to develop a more cost-effective device than those currently available. Working on four species of tsetse fly we have shown that a small 25×25 cm target with adjacent flanking net was up to 38x more cost-effective at killing tsetse flies than existing devices. These findings suggest that this new technology may make vector control in HAT foci an affordable option."

However, due to the unique properties of community composition data, standard data analysis tools are likely to produce statistical artifacts. For a typical experiment studying microbial ecosystems these artifacts can lead to erroneous conclusions about patterns of associations between microbial taxa. We developed a new procedure that seeks to infer ecological associations between microbial populations, by 1) taking advantage of the proportionality invariance of relative abundance data and 2) making assumptions about the underlying network structure when the number of taxa in the dataset is larger than the number of sampled communities. Additionally, we employed a novel tool to generate biologically plausible synthetic data and objectively benchmark current association inference tools. Finally, we tested our procedures on a large-scale 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset sampled from the human gut."

Genes are transcribed only if their encoded proteins are required by the environmental or developmental conditions of a cell, and once a certain protein is no longer needed, it is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Transcriptional activators appeared to contradict this simple economic principle, as it had been claimed that they had to be degraded in order to function. The claim was based upon a correlation: if the degradation of an activator was prevented by drugs or mutations in the UPS, the activator became stable but also nonfunctional. We have now shown that it is not the activator itself but its inhibitor that is the functionally relevant target of the UPS. Furthermore, we have found that the degradation of the inhibitor is controlled by a protein complex called Mediator. The activator is known to recruit Mediator to gene promoters, where Mediator assists RNA polymerase in initiating transcription. Mediator was always considered to be completely under the control of the activator; however, we observe that by regulating the degradation of the inhibitor, Mediator is also able to control the activator and thereby to orchestrate its own recruitment to gene promoters."

BAD-1 harbors a repetitive domain – a tandem repeat - that is present in up to 41 copies in the protein and essential in pathogenesis. We report an example of mimicry between this BAD-1 repeat and mammalian thrombospondin type-1 (TSP-1), a molecule that helps regulate human immunity. BAD-1 tandem repeats shares a tryptophan-rich sequence with TSP-1 that binds to tissue matrix and circulating immune cells. Like TSP-1, BAD-1 binds to this matrix. Through this property, BAD-1 binds and retards the action of white blood cells that fight fungal infection. Thus, we describe how fungi have evolved the means to mimic molecules that mammals commonly use to dampen unwanted immune responses, thus promoting pathogen survival."

While RNA viruses have long been considered unable to correct mistakes during replication, CoVs such as SARS-CoV and the recently emerged MERS-CoV are important exceptions to this paradigm. All CoVs encode an exoribonuclease activity in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is proposed to prevent and/or remove misincorporated nucleotides. Because of the demonstrated resistance of SARS-CoV to the antiviral drug ribavirin (RBV), we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. Using RBV and the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), we show that CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN−) are highly susceptible to RBV and 5-FU, in contrast to wild-type (ExoN+) CoVs. The inhibitory activity of 5-FU against ExoN− viruses resulted specifically from 5-FU incorporation during viral RNA synthesis that lead to extensive mutagenesis within the viral population, and was associated with a profound decrease in virus specific infectivity. These results demonstrate the proofreading activity of ExoN during virus replication and suggest that inhibitors of ExoN activity could be broadly useful inhibitors of CoV replication in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens."

We found that the virus genome is transported to the plasma membrane using cholesterol-enriched recycling endosomes through cell cycle-independent activation of the centrosome by recruiting YB-1, which is a mitotic centrosomal protein. We also revealed that the cholesterol-enriched endosomes are important for clustering of viral structural proteins at lipid rafts to assemble the virus particles. These results suggest that local accumulation of cholesterol, via fusion of endosomes to the plasma membrane, is one of the triggers for the virus assembly concomitantly with arrival of the virus genome beneath the plasma membrane."

A key immunological feature of VL patients is that their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) do not respond to stimulation with leishmanial antigen. Surprisingly, when employing a whole blood assay we discovered significant levels of IFNγ in response to soluble Leishmania donovani antigen (WBA) in VL patients. We were interested to understand the relevance of the IFNγ to the anti-parasitic response. Animal models and in vitro studies have shown that IFNγ is a key effector cytokine required for control of the infection, however, the role of endogenous IFNγ in control of parasites in VL patients, has not been demonstrated. Our results show that CD4 cells were required for and were the source of Leishmania specific IFNγ in WBA of VL patients. Optimal IFNγ response required interaction with HLA-DR, supporting that VL is not due to an intrinsic Th1 response defect per se. The Leishmania driven IFNγ appears to limit parasite growth in patients with active VL, since blockade of IFNγ ex-vivo in splenic aspirate cultures enhanced parasite survival. This suggests that IFNγ may have been prematurely dismissed as an adjunct therapy in treatment of VL."

Lung stem cells must therefore have the ability to repair DNA damage to survive and achieve tissue homeostasis. Lung airways are composed of different types of cells, including basal cells, which have been proposed to be the stem cells of the lung. Here, we show that lung basal stem cells have a superior ability to resolve DNA damage compared to alveolar progenitor cells, thus allowing these cells to survive and proliferate after injury. Accordingly, basal stem cells isolated from patients with a long history of tobacco smoking had remarkable proliferative potential compared to those extracted from never smokers. However, we demonstrate that basal stem cells predominately use nonhomologous end joining to repair DNA double-strand breaks, a notoriously error-prone pathway. A subset of polyploid basal stem cells was observed in cigarette-smoking patients, pointing to the accumulation of genetic instability in these long-lived cells. Gene expression analyses revealed that lung squamous cell carcinoma, a subtype of lung cancer that almost exclusively occurs in smokers, carries a transcriptional fingerprint of basal cells, suggesting that lung basal stem cells could be the cells of origin of this subtype of lung cancer. We postulate that further unravelling of DNA repair in lung cells may lead to potential therapeutic targets in the prevention or treatment of lung diseases."

P. falciparum must reproduce sexually in the mosquito vector. One consequence of sexual reproduction is that parasites cotransmitted by the same mosquito are related to one another. The degree of genetic relatedness of these parasites can be as great as that of full-siblings. However, our understanding of the cotransmission process is incomplete, and little is known of the role of cotransmission in influencing population genomic processes. To help bridge this gap, we developed a simulation model to determine which of the steps involved in transmission have the greatest impact on the relatedness of parasites cotransmitted by a mosquito vector. The primary goal of this study is to characterize the outcomes of cotransmission following single or multiple transmission events. Our model yields new insights into the cotransmission process, which we believe will be useful for understanding the results from more complicated population models and epidemiological conditions. Such an understanding is important for the use of population genomics to inform public health decisions as well as for understanding of parasite evolution."

An abnormality in the regulation of mRNA and protein expression is a hallmark of many human diseases, including cancer. In some eukaryotic genes translation can be influenced by small DNA sequences termed upstream open reading frames (uORFs). These elements located upstream to the gene start codon may either negatively influence the ability of the translational machinery to reinitiate translation of the main protein or, much less frequently, stimulate protein translation by enabling the ribosomes to bypass cis-acting inhibitory elements. CDKN1B, which encodes the cell cycle inhibitor p27KIP1, includes an uORF in its 5′UTR sequence. p27KIP1 expression is often reduced in cancer, and germline mutations have been identified in CDKN1B in patients affected with a syndrome (MEN4) characterized by varying combinations of tumors in endocrine glands. Here we show that a small deletion in the uORF upstream to CDKN1B reduces translation reinitiation efficiency, leading to underexpression of p27KIP1 and coinciding with tumorigenesis. This study describes a novel mechanism by which p27KIP1 could be underexpressed in human tumors. In addition, our data provide a new insight to the unique pathogenic potential of uORFs in human diseases."

These expression resources are shared between the different molecules that encode the genetic code, resulting in non-trivial couplings and competitions between the different gene expression stages. Such competitions should be considered when analyzing the cellular economy of the cell, the genome evolution, and the design of synthetic expression circuits. Here we study the effect of couplings and competitions for ribosomes by performing a whole-cell simulation of translation of S. cerevisiae, with parameters estimated from experimental data. We demonstrate that by periodically changing the mRNA levels of a single gene (endogenous or heterologous) or a set of genes, the translation of all S. cerevisiae genes are affected in a periodic manner. We numerically estimate the exact impact of the mRNA levels periodicity on the translation process dynamics, as well as on the dynamics of the free ribosomal pool and the way it is affected by parameters such as the codon composition of the oscillating gene, its initiation rate and mRNA levels. Furthermore, we show that the codon compositions of synthetically highly expressed heterologous genes that are expected to oscillate must be carefully considered. For example, synonymous mutations resulting in “traffic jams” of ribosomes along the fluctuated mRNAs may cause significant fluctuations of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of all genes."

During meiosis, homologous recombination occurs frequently, initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) made by Spo11. Meiotic recombination usually occurs between sequences at allelic positions on homologous chromosomes, but a DSB within a repetitive element (e.g., a retrotransposon) can provoke recombination between non-allelic sequences instead. This can create genomic havoc in the form of gross chromosomal rearrangements, which underlie many recurrent human mutations. It has been thought that cells minimize this risk by disfavoring DSB formation in repetitive elements, partly based on studies showing that presence of a Ty element (a yeast retrotransposon) can suppress nearby DSB activity. Whether this is a general feature of Tys has not been evaluated, however. Here, we generated a comprehensive map of Tys in the rapidly sporulating SK1 strain and examined DSB formation in and around all of these endogenous Ty elements. Remarkably, most natural Ty elements do not appear to suppress DSB formation nearby, and at least some of them increase local DSBs. These findings have implications for understanding the relationship between host and transposon, and for understanding the impact of retrotransposons on genome stability and evolution during sexual reproduction."

Since its advent, this new method has generated much excitement in the field of functional genomics. Proper computational modeling of the ChIP-seq process is needed for both data scoring and determination of adequate sequencing depth, as it provides the computational foundation for analyzing ChIP-seq data. In our study, we show the characteristics of ChIP-seq data and present in silico ChIP sequencing, a computational method to simulate the experimental outcome. On the basis of our data characterization, we observed transcription factor binding sites with excessive enrichment of sequence tags. Our simulation results reveal that both the genomic background and the binding sites are not uniform. On the basis of our simulation results, we propose a statistical procedure using the more realistic genomic background model to identify binding sites in ChIP-seq data."

Peripheral nerve destruction and activation of type 2 angiotensin II receptors on sensory neurons have been proposed to mediate bacteria-induced hypoesthesia in infected skin. In addition, mycolactone was recently shown to block the co-translational translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum in host cells, leading to defective inflammatory responses. Here we examined if this last mechanism may also contribute to inhibit neuro-inflammation and particularly in the context of neuropathic pain. Using a representative panel of primary cells from the central and peripheral nervous systems, we found that indeed, mycolactone potently inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Notably, mycolactone prevented the polarization and pro-inflammatory functions of cortical microglia, which are critical inducers of neuroinflammation. Consistent with our in vitro findings, mycolactone had potent anti-inflammatory effects on the spinal cord of rats injected in the spinal canal, with no apparent side effects. Our data show that mycolactone suppresses inflammatory responses in the nervous system similarly as in the immune system, suggesting that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may, at least partially, be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties."

They are caused by parasitic nematodes like Brugia malayi that rely on their endosymbiont Wolbachia for their survival and fertility. These bacteria are a recognized drug target in the search for treatments killing adult worms. To understand the transmission of Wolbachia from the embryonic to adult stages, we developed new techniques to track these bacteria at the cellular and tissue levels. These techniques include immunofluorescence in whole mount adult tissues and embryos. We found that Wolbachia segregate asymetrically in specific cells, in a lineage-specific manner during early Brugia embryogenesis, and rely on cell fusion to subsequently populate the adult hypodermal chords. From the chords, the Wolbachia can be secreted in the secretory-excretory canal, suggesting that in addition to dead worms releasing the bacteria in the human body, living worms may also secrete Wolbachia, whose role in stimulating the immune system in filarial pathologies is now well established."

Future applications method pave way new strategies generate - generation biologics .","In order to adapt to surrounding environments, multiple signaling pathways have been evolved in cells. The first step of these pathways is to detect external stimuli, which is conducted by the dynamic interactions between cell surface receptors and extracellular ligands. As a result, recognition of extracellular ligands by cell surface receptors is an indispensable component of many physiological or pathological activities. In both natural selection and drug design, the presence of multiple binding sites in extracellular ligand complexes (so-called multi-specific ligands) is a common strategy to target different receptors on surface of the same cell. Such spatial organization of ligand binding sites can elaborately modulate the downstream signaling pathways. However, our understanding to the interactions between multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors is largely limited by the fact that these interactions are difficult to quantify and they have only been successfully measured in a very small number of cases in vivo. Using a simple computational model, we can realistically simulate the binding process between specially designed multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors on cell surfaces. This study therefore provides a useful pathway to unravel basic mechanisms of ligand-receptor interactions and design principles for new drug candidates."

Facilitated goods transportation, live stock exchange, people travelling more easily, and most importantly world climate alterations, might be some of the reasons for this mosquito habitat spreading. Emergence of WNV in North America, Europe, and most Mediterranean countries like Turkey, Greece and Israel is evidence of this spreading. Furthermore, emergence and re-emergence of some of these mosquito borne viruses in new areas may be accompanied with changes in their pre-known pathogenesis. Re-emergence of ZIKV in the South Pacific and America from 2007 to 2016 was accompanied with an increase in neurovirulent diseases and congenital malformations. In this study, we evaluated the presence of WNV and ZIKV via serological and genome detection in human samples and mosquitoes (viral genome analysis) from southern Iran. This region is on the coast with a warm and tropical climate suitable for inhabitation and expansion of the vectors harboring these two viruses. We caught a large spectrum of mosquitoes from these areas. After classification, we analyzed the mosquitoes’ pools for WNV and ZIKV genomic RNA. Our results showed that 20.6% of the studied human samples were IgG reactive to WNV while no antibodies against ZIKV were detected. We found WNV RNA genome in three mosquitoes’ pools. The genomic analysis was negative for ZIKV in both human and mosquito samples. Based on the results WNV is notably circulating in southern Iran; while no evidence of ZIKV infection in people or circulation in any of the vectors was observed."

Most of currently used methods face challenges due to tiny volumes of engorged blood, in case of mammals also enucleated, as well as quick progress of blood digestion which leads to rapid DNA and protein degradation. New approach towards blood source determination presented in this study is based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry that identifies unique peptide sequences of host hemoglobins, showing high precision and sensitivity together with a longer time period for successful host determination when compared to nowadays standardly used DNA sequencing. It was tested and verified on engorged phlebotomine sand flies from both laboratory colonies and natural endemic areas and also on Culex mosquitoes and shall be universal to hematophagous insects. Beside blood meal identification, it allows also the use of both morphological and molecular methods (DNA- or protein-based) for the species identification of the analysed specimen."

Nerve impulse triggers the opening of RyR channels, thus increasing the cytoplasmic calcium levels, which subsequently leads to muscle contraction. Congenital mutations in a specific type of RyR that is present in skeletal muscles, RyR1, lead to central core disease (CCD), which leads to weakened muscle. RyR1 mutations also render patients to be highly susceptible to malignant hyperthermia, an adverse reaction to general anesthesia. Although it is generally known that CCD mutations abort RyR1 function, the molecular basis of RyR1 dysfunction remains largely unknown because of the lack of atomic-level structure. Here, we present a structural model of the RyR1 pore region, where many of the CCD mutations are located. Molecular dynamics simulations of the pore region confirm the positions of residues experimentally known to be relevant for function. Furthermore, electrophysiological experiments and simulations shed light on the loss of function of CCD mutant channels. The combined theoretical and experimental studies on RyR1 elucidate the ion conduction pathway of RyR1 and a potential molecular origin of muscle diseases."

The identification and characterization of the historical dynamics of these sites in DENV have relevance to several applications such as diagnosis and drug and vaccine development. In this study, we have identified sequence fragments that were conserved across the majority of available DENV sequences, analyzed their historical dynamics, and evaluated their relevance as candidate vaccine targets, using various bioinformatics-based methods and immune assay in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) transgenic mice. This approach provides a framework for large-scale and systematic analysis of other human pathogens."

It has been estimated that genetic factors contribute to 40%–60% of the vulnerability to drug addiction, and environmental factors provide the remainder. What are the genes and pathways underlying addiction? Is there a common molecular network underlying addiction to different abusive substances? Is there any network property that may explain the long-lived and often irreversible molecular and structural changes after addiction? These important questions were traditionally studied experimentally. The explosion of genomic and proteomic data in recent years both enabled and necessitated bioinformatic studies of addiction. We integrated data derived from multiple technology platforms and collected 2,343 items of evidence linking genes and chromosome regions to addiction. We identified 18 statistically significantly enriched molecular pathways. In particular, five of them were common for four types of addictive drugs, which may underlie shared rewarding and addictive actions, including two new ones, GnRH signaling pathway and gap junction. We connected the common pathways into a hypothetical common molecular network for addiction. We observed that fast and slow positive feedback loops were interlinked through CAMKII, which may provide clues to explain some of the irreversible features of addiction."

Still there are many controversies on the route of infection, but traumatic inoculation of the subcutaneous tissue with the thorn or soil causative organism through minor skin trauma is a popular theory. This is due to the fact that, the origin and natural habitat of Madurella species, the prevalent mycetoma agents are still unknown. In order to predict the natural habitat of M. mycetomatis we investigated its phylogenetic relationships to species with known ecology. Two genes phylogeny based on LSU and ITS was performed for the species of the genus Madurella and representative genera from the family of Chaetomiaceae. Our findings confirmed that Madurella species are phylogenetically member of the family Chaetomiaceae. Members of this family are often found in dung and manure-enriched soil. We therefore suggest that animal dung, abundantly present in endemic villages, could be a possible niche for Madurella and plays an essential role in the onset of eumycetoma. This will help in understanding the origin of the disease and could be a base for future in depth study to investigate the presence of Madurella in dung from endemic areas."

An antibody against a Wolbachia surface protein was used to monitor the distribution of endobacteria during the B. malayi life cycle. In situ hybridization with probes binding to Wolbachia 16S rRNA were used to confirm results. Only a few cells contain Wolbachia in microfilariae and vector stage larvae; this suggests that the bacteria need to be maintained, but may have limited importance for these stages. Large numbers of Wolbachia were detected in the lateral chords of L4 larvae and of young adult worms, but not in the developing reproductive tissue. Confocal laser scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that Wolbachia are aligned towards the developing germline. It can be hypothesized that Wolbachia invade developing ovaries from the lateral chords. In inseminated females, Wolbachia were detected in the ovaries and embryos. In young males, Wolbachia were found in parts of the testis and in the lateral chords in the vicinity of testicular tissue but never in mature spermatids or spermatozoa.

Antivenoms are produced by immunizing large animals with cocktails of snake venoms resulting in antibodies recognizing toxic as well as non-toxic venom proteins to variable degrees. As a result, high doses of antivenom are needed for treating a snakebite victim, causing more severe adverse reactions due to a high burden of heterologous antivenom proteins. For the first time, we have characterized the antibody recognition sites on hundreds of pit viper toxins using high-throughput peptide microarray technology and an antivenom specific for three pit vipers inflicting a high number of bites in Central America. Most pit viper toxins are enzymes known to have a catalytic site important for toxicity. However, our results suggest that the employed antivenom generally does not target such sites, but instead inhibits toxicity by binding to alternative sites, possibly causing conformational shifts in the toxin structures or interference with toxin-target recognition. The identification of these toxin-specific recognition sites may explain why the antivenom is effective against certain snakebites from pit vipers whose venoms are not part of the immunization mixture."

Loss of AL6 and AL7 as well as loss of AtBMI1a and AtBMI1b causes transcriptional derepression and a delayed chromatin state switch from H3K4me3 to H3K27me3 enrichment of several seed developmental genes (e.g. ABI3, DOG1, CRU3, CHO1). Furthermore, GFP-AL6 and LHP1-myc directly bind at ABI3 and DOG1 loci. We propose that AL PHD-PRC1 complexes, built around H3K4me3, lead to a switch from the H3K4me3-associated activation to the H3K27me3-associated repression of seed developmental genes. Our study unravels a striking connection between PHD-domain proteins and PRC1, two types of readers for the functionally opposite chromatin marks. The newly uncovered mechanism is relevant to understand reprogramming of gene activity, which is at the heart of plant growth phase transitions and of cell differentiations in plants and other organisms."

New, virus-specific therapies are under development by the pharmaceutical industry that target aspects of virus entry and genome replication. However, the process of viral assembly and release from the cell remains cloaked in mystery and thus difficult to target for drug development. Here we describe studies that reveal a previously unrecognized role for the nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) of HCV during a late step in this process. We show that mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of NS2 disrupt a maturation step that is required to convert a viral assembly intermediate to a fully infectious virus particle. Additional genetic evidence suggests that this maturation step occurs in concert with another nonstructural protein, NS5A. This study thus sheds new light on the role of nonstructural proteins in assembly and maturation of infectious HCV particles and suggests new targets for drug development."

These sporozoites migrate from the skin into the circulation and then enter the liver to start a new infection inside hepatocytes. Sporozoites have the capacity to traverse mammalian cells. They breach their membranes and migrate through their cytosol. This process is required for infection of the liver and triggers the exposure of adhesive proteins in the apical end of sporozoites, a process that facilitates invasion of hepatocytes. We found that elevations of cAMP inside sporozoites mediate the exposure of adhesive proteins and therefore the infection process. Mutant sporozoites that do not express adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme that synthesizes cAMP, are not able to expose the adhesive proteins and their infectivity is reduced by half. Reinsertion of adenylyl cyclase gene in the mutant sporozoites recovers their capacity to expose adhesive proteins and to infect hepatocytes, confirming the specific role of this protein in infection. These results demonstrate the importance of cAMP and the exposure of adhesive proteins in sporozoites, but also show that Plasmodium sporozoites have other mechanisms to invade host hepatocytes that are not inhibited in the mutant parasites."

They pose a threat to genome integrity but at the same time regulate expression of many genes and have been proposed to be a major factor contributing to genome evolution. One of the processes responsible for controlling activity of transposons and other repetitive elements is transcriptional gene silencing. This process uses small interfering RNA and long non-coding RNA to recruit enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications. Several proteins have been identified to be needed for siRNA–mediated transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana, however for many of them their position in the silencing pathway is unknown. One of those proteins is SPT5L/KTF1, a homolog of an elongation factor associated with RNA Polymerase II. Here we establish the position of SPT5L in the silencing pathway and propose the molecular mechanism of its function. This gives further knowledge of the mechanism of transcriptional gene silencing and is important to understand how transposons are controlled."

To prevent damage, all organisms that require iron have developed mechanisms to tightly control iron levels. Dysregulation of iron metabolism is detrimental and can contribute to a wide range of diseases, including cancer. This paper presents a predictive mathematical model of iron regulation linked to iron utilization, oxidative stress, and the oncogenic response specific to normal breast epithelial cells. The model uses a discrete modeling framework to generate novel biological hypotheses for an investigation of how normal breast cells become malignant cells, capturing a breast cancer phenotype of iron homeostasis through overexpression and knockout simulations. The new biology discovered is (1) IRP2 overexpression alters the iron homeostasis pathway in breast cells, without affecting the oxidative stress response or oncogenic pathways, (2) an activated oncogenic pathway disrupts iron regulation in breast cancer cells."

However, Khoesan populations are poorly defined, while archeological evidence suggests a once broader dispersal of click-speaking southern African foragers. Migrations into the regions populated by contemporary Khoesan involved agro-pastoral Bantu around 1,500 years ago, followed over a millennium later by the arrival of European colonists establishing a halfway station for a maritime route between Europe and the East, which led to unions between diverse global populations. Using almost a million genetic markers for 103 individuals, we confirmed a significant Khoesan contribution to five southern African populations. The Ju/'hoan show genetic isolation (early divergence from all other modern humans), carry no significant non-Khoesan contributions, and unlike most global populations lack signatures of gene-based adaption to agriculture. The !Xun show two distinct Khoesan prehistories; while comparable to the female-derived Khoesan contribution to the amaXhosa Bantu, the male-derived Bantu contribution to the !Xun most likely represents cultural-driven gender-biased gene-flow. Emanating largely from male-derived European ancestral contributions, the Basters showed the highest maternal Khoesan contribution, while the Coloured showed the largest within population and regional-associated variability. The unique admixture fractions of the two latter populations reflect both early diverged and recently diverged human lineages."

Since the late 1990s, the common and koi carp culture industries have suffered devastating worldwide losses due to cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3). In the present study, we report the development of an attenuated recombinant vaccine against CyHV-3. Two genes were deleted from the viral genome, leading to a recombinant virus that is no longer capable of causing the disease but can be propagated in cell culture (for vaccine production) and infect fish when added to the water, thereby immunizing the fish. This attenuated recombinant vaccine also had a drastic defect in spreading from vaccinated to non-vaccinated cohabitant fish. The vaccine induced a protective mucosal immune response capable of preventing the entry of virulent CyHV-3 and is compatible with the simultaneous vaccination of a large number of carp by simply immersing the fish in water containing the vaccine. This vaccine represents a promising tool for controlling the most dreadful disease ever encountered by the carp culture industries. In addition, the present study highlights the importance of the CyHV-3 - carp model for studying alloherpesvirus transmission and mucosal immunity in teleost skin."

In addition to predicting the content of sensory signals, an optimal system should also predict the reliability (or ‘precision’) of those signals to minimise the influence of unreliable sensory information. It has been proposed that attention optimises this process by boosting prediction error signals, which are coded as the difference (or ‘mismatch’) between predicted and observed stimulus features. Accordingly, this theory predicts that attention should increase the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. We tested this hypothesis in human participants by training a decoding algorithm to identify ‘mismatch information’ in the brain, recorded by electroencephalography (EEG), following the presentation of surprising stimuli that were either attended or ignored. We found that attention did indeed increase the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response, supporting the notion that attention and prediction are intricately related processes."

The M. tuberculosis complex has several strategies to parasitize the host. After infection is established, these pathogens are rarely eliminated from the host, and nowadays approximately a third of the world's human population is infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The elucidation of the parasitic mechanisms of the M. tuberculosis complex is important for the development of novel strategies against the disease. The major portal entry of M. tuberculosis complex is through the respiratory tract. On the surface of the airway, hyaluronan retains bactericidal enzymes so that they are “ready-to-use”, protecting tissues from invading pathogens. Furthermore, fragmented hyaluronan produced as a result of infection is used by the immune system as a sensor of infection. Thus, hyaluronan plays a pivotal role in host defenses in the respiratory tract. However, in this study, we observed that the M. tuberculosis complex utilizes hyaluronan as a carbon source for multiplication. We also found that the M. tuberculosis complex has hyaluronidase activity and showed that it is critical for hyaluronan-dependent growth of the M. tuberculosis complex. This study demonstrates a novel parasitic mechanism of the M. tuberculosis complex and suggests that mycobacterial hyaluronidase is a potential drug target."

Riboswitches are a classic example. A typical riboswitch senses the cellular concentration of a small molecule. By refolding itself into a new structure, the riboswitch converts that information into changes in rates for synthesis of related metabolites. Understanding how the small molecule physically changes RNA structure can help us to target riboswitches, which occur mainly in bacteria, for drug design, or to engineer new riboswitches. This understanding has been blocked because 1) we cannot view intermediate stages experimentally and 2) simulations cannot reach the timescale for the structural conversion. Recent advances in RNA structure modeling enable us to model intermediate states. A new computer specialized for long timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, called Anton, helps us to extend the simulation timescale. We modeled intermediate riboswitch structures, focusing on a reduced segment of the structure-switching region, in order to reduce the time required for a transition. We simulated an MD trajectory in which a small molecule converted the structure of this reduced switching region. Some steps in riboswitch structural transitions are therefore accessible to the newly extended MD timescale. Wider availability of resources like Anton can aid the advancement of riboswitch engineering and novel antibiotic design."

We tested the method in Kenya and Bangladesh and found that soil contamination with helminth eggs was prevalent in both study areas.

NK cell potential is determined by the level of MHC class I on surrounding cells and on the NK cell itself. We have uncovered a highly complex system regulating HLA-C expression in NK cells. A NK-specific promoter produces a large array of differentially-spliced transcripts that vary in their ability to be translated into HLA-C protein. As NK cells differentiate and become more cytotoxic, the level of HLA-C expression increases, and this correlates with an increased abundance of translatable HLA-C mRNAs. A subset of HLA-C alleles have a promoter polymorphism that abrogates its activity, resulting in NK cells that are unable to upregulate HLA-C levels, and consequently, possess increased functional activity. Overall, our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of NK cell development, as well as a method to identify individuals with high NK activity, that may provide superior outcomes in hematopoietic stem cell transfer."

High and sudden energy demand is seen during cell-shape change, a process in which ATP fuels the cytoskeletal machinery that drives cell-morphology alteration. How a cell organizes high-energy surges without disrupting global ATP homeostasis remains an important research question. One view proposes that ATP is heterogeneously distributed, but the cytoskeletal proteins actin and myosin receive regional and preferential access to ATP. Yet this model raises another question: how is ATP funneled to these proteins from distant sources? To address some of these questions, we studied the highly localized molecular events controlling actin dynamics around phagocytic activity of macrophages. We demonstrate that actin and creatine kinase-B (CK-B), a long-known enzyme involved in ATP supply, are simultaneously recruited into the sites of action during the early phases of particle ingestion. Local availability of CK-activity and local generation of ATP promotes on-site actin remodeling and particle capture efficiency, and thus supports successful initiation of the first phases of phagocytosis. Interestingly, this coupling between local CK-activity and actin regulation is only relevant for complement-mediated phagocytosis (used by immune cells to target specific particles for ingestion). We predict that our findings may also shed light on how shape dynamics is energized in other cell types."

One of the most drastic shape transformations occurs during the transition from spread to rounded morphologies. When this transition occurs rapidly, there is insufficient time for significant changes in surface area to occur, although the final size of the rounded cell indicates a significant reduction in apparent cell surface area at light microscope resolution. By contrast, high-resolution scanning electron micrographs of rapidly rounded cells reveal that a large amount of surface area is stored in a highly convoluted surface morphology consisting of bleb-like protrusions (BLiPs) and other small structures that are unrecognizable at lower resolution. This surface reserve is an important part of the mechanism that allows rapid and efficient large scale transformations of cell shape. Remarkably, although this convoluted morphology has been observed for decades, there has been very little effort recognizing and including this surface surplus in mathematical modeling of cell morphology and physiology. In this paper, we develop three complementary models to fill this void and lay the foundation for future investigations of the mechanisms that drive cellular morphological dynamics."

Schistosomes cause the chronic debilitating disease schistosomiasis. Thus, it is hoped that dissecting pathways that underlie the snail/schistosome relationship might translate into alternative control strategies that will include blocking transmission of the parasite at the snail-stage of its development. Induction of stress genes is a feature distinguishing early exposed juvenile susceptible NMRI snails from resistant BS-90 snail stocks. To further analyze this apparent involvement of stress induction and snail susceptibility, here we applied heat stress to the resistant BS-90 snail, enhancing induction of stress genes (Hsp 70, Hsp 90 and RT) prior to infection. Results showed these resistant snails became susceptible, indicating resistance as being a temperature sensitive phenotype in these snails. Stressed resistant snails treated with the Hsp 90 specific inhibitor, geldanamycin, prior to exposure, were, however, shown to maintain their refractory phenotype. Interestingly, inhibitor treated susceptible snails also became non-susceptible. Collectively, these data point to stress induction as an important early step in the ability of S. mansoni to infect juvenile B. glabrata snails."

Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is effective against Ae. aegypti, but lengthy application time makes IRS difficult to scale within urban environments. We compared the application and entomological efficacy of Classic IRS against two novel Aedes-targeting IRS application methods (Targeted IRS [TIRS]- insecticide applied to walls below 1.5 m and under furniture and Resting Site TIRS [RS-TIRS]- insecticide applied only under furniture) within experimental houses using a carbamate insecticide. Both TIRS and RS-TIRS took less time to apply and used less insecticide compared to Classic IRS. Mortality of pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti did not differ among treatments out to two months post-application, and there was no difference in mortality between Classic IRS and TIRS out to four months post-application. These data provide evidence that IRS application methods can be improved to take less time and insecticide yet not lose entomological efficacy, making TIRS more scalable within urban environments. However, larger field studies with epidemiologic endpoints are needed to further assess the efficacy of these modified TIRS techniques."

One well-known mechanism of regulation of histone function is the covalent modification of histone proteins. Replacement of modified histones by new histones has recently emerged as an additional layer of regulation (hereafter referred to as histone turnover). Although histone replacement can affect substantial parts of eukaryotic genomes, the mechanisms that control histone exchange are largely unknown. Here, we report a screening method for epigenetic regulators that we applied to search for histone exchange factors. The screening method is based on our finding that global chromatin changes in mutant cells can be inferred from chromatin states on short DNA barcodes. By analyzing the chromatin status of DNA barcodes of many yeast mutants in parallel, we identified positive and negative regulators of histone exchange. In particular, we find that the HAT-B complex promotes histone turnover. HAT-B is known to acetylate the tails of newly synthesized histones, but its role in chromatin assembly has been unclear. Hif1, the nuclear binding partner of HAT-B in the NuB4 complex, also promotes histone exchange but by non-overlapping mechanisms. These results provide a new perspective on pathways of histone exchange."

However, predicting how species will respond to future climate change is very difficult. In this study, I analyze the extinctions caused by the climate change that has already occurred. Numerous studies find that species are shifting their geographic ranges in response to climate change, typically moving to higher elevations and latitudes. These studies also contain valuable data on local extinctions, as they document the loss of populations at the “warm edge” of species’ ranges (lower elevations and latitudes). Here, I use these data to show that recent local extinctions related to climate change have already occurred in hundreds of species around the world. Specifically, among 976 species surveyed, local extinctions occurred in 47%. These extinctions are common across climatic zones, habitats, and groups of organisms but are especially common in tropical regions (which contain most of Earth’s species), in animals (relative to plants), and in freshwater habitats. In summary, this study reveals local extinctions in hundreds of species related to the limited global warming that has already occurred. These extinctions will almost certainly increase as global climate continues to warm in the coming decades."

In the outer layer of the cortex, resting state patterns emerge as neuronal avalanches, precisely scale-invariant spatiotemporal bursts that often engage large populations of neurons. Little is known about how the brain suppresses involuntary movements during such activity. Here, we show that the striatum, which is part of the cortex-basal ganglia loop, maintains a low-correlation state during resting activity. By using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches with pharmacological manipulations, we demonstrate that the precise configuration of this low-correlation state effectively contributes to involuntary movements. Nonselective blockade of intra-striatal inhibition abolished the low-correlation striatal resting state, barely affected cortical avalanches, and led to involuntary movements at low rate. In contrast, selectively reducing striatal interneuron inhibition strongly affected cortical avalanches and triggered involuntary movements at high rate while maintaining a relatively decorrelated striatal resting state. Our results demonstrate the importance of different inhibitory striatal circuits in the suppression of involuntary movements and suggest that the precise spatiotemporal configuration of striatal activity plays an active role in the regulation of cortical resting state activity and motor control."

There is evidence that this may be due to changes in neuronal inhibition, suggesting that inhibitory neurons may be involved in learning to ignore irrelevant inputs. By developing a computational model that learns relevance and irrelevance through changes in the strength of feedforward inhibition, we are able to simulate many specific effects of inhibitory neuron dysfunction on behavior. We also show two computational advantages to this mechanism: (1) if relevance is signaled by the level of excitatory activity, then downstream circuits can easily avoid learning from irrelevant stimuli, (2) relevance learning can occur simultaneously with other types of learning. The model therefore offers insight into the relationships between neural inhibition and behavior, including symptoms of schizophrenia."

Despite the importance of controlling G1 cyclin levels, the mechanisms regulating the degradation of these proteins are not well understood. We have now elucidated the mechanism of degradation of the yeast G1 cyclin Cln3. In contrast to related cyclins in yeast, Cln3 is targeted for degradation by two redundant pathways, which act to keep Cln3 levels extremely low. This finding may have implications for understanding how G1 cyclins are degraded in human cells and how expression of G1 cyclins may be misregulated during cancer development."

This process is highly regulated, as defects during DNA replication cause genomic instability, leading to various genetic disorders including cancers. To thwart these problems, cells carry an array of complex mechanisms to deal with various obstacles found across the genome that can hamper DNA replication and cause DNA damage. Understanding how these mechanisms are regulated and orchestrated is of paramount importance in the field. In this report, we describe how Swi1, a Timeless-related protein in fission yeast, regulates efficient replication of telomeres, which are considered to be difficult to replicate due to the presence of repetitive DNA and telomere-binding proteins. We show that Swi1 prevents telomere damage and maintains telomere length by protecting integrity of telomeric repeats. Swi1-mediated telomere maintenance is independent of telomerase activity, and loss of Swi1 causes hyper-activation of recombination-based telomere maintenance, which generates heterogeneous telomeres. Similar telomerase-independent and recombination-dependent mechanism is utilized by approximately 15% of human cancers, linking telomere replication defects with cancer development. Thus, our study may be relevant in understanding the role of telomere replication defects in the development of cancers in humans."

We used a variety of phylogenetic approaches to compare the output data and found that the two schemes gave very similar results. 7L has the advantage that it is a conventional multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST) scheme based on housekeeping genes and is supported by a publically accessible database by which genotypes can be readily assigned as known or new sequence types by any investigator, but is currently only applicable to L. interrogans and L. kirschneri. Conversely, 6L can be applied to all pathogenic Leptospira spp., but is not a conventional MLST scheme by design and is not available online. 6L sequences from 271 strains have been released into the public domain, and phylogenetic analysis of new sequences using this scheme requires their download and offline analysis."

KSHV expresses a number of transcripts with the potential to generate multiple proteins, yet relies on the cellular translation machinery that is primed to synthesize only one protein per mRNA. Here we report that the viral transcript encompassing ORF35–37 is able to direct synthesis of two proteins and that the translational switch is regulated by two short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the native 5′ untranslated region. uORFs are elements commonly found upstream of mammalian genes that function to interfere with unrestrained ribosomal scanning and thus repress translation of the major ORF. The sequence of the viral uORF appears unimportant, and instead functions to position the translation machinery in a location that favors translation of the downstream major ORF, via a reinitiation mechanism. Thus, KSHV uses a host strategy generally reserved to repress translation to instead allow for the expression of an internal gene."

L1s comprise ~17% of human DNA and it is estimated that an average human genome has ~80–100 active L1s. L1 moves throughout the genome via a “copy-and-paste” mechanism known as retrotransposition. L1 retrotransposition is known to cause mutations; thus, it stands to reason that the host cell has evolved mechanisms to protect the cell from unabated retrotransposition. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) inhibits the retrotransposition of human L1 and Alu retrotransposons, as well as related retrotransposons from mice and zebrafish. Biochemical and genetic data suggest that ZAP interacts with L1 RNA. Fluorescent microscopy demonstrates that ZAP associates with L1 in cytoplasmic foci that co-localize with stress granule proteins. Mechanistic analyses suggest that ZAP reduces the expression of full-length L1 RNA and the L1-encoded proteins, thereby providing mechanistic insight for how ZAP may restricts retrotransposition. Importantly, these data suggest that ZAP initially may have evolved to combat endogenous retrotransposons and subsequently was co-opted as a viral restriction factor."

A repair process known as nucleotide excision repair (NER) is dedicated to correcting this UV damage. Although the enzymatic steps of this repair process are known in detail, we still do not understand how it copes with the native situation in the cell, where the DNA is tightly wrapped around protein spools called nucleosomes. Our study has revealed the molecular mechanism by which an enigmatic component of NER called UV-DDB stimulates excision of UV-induced lesions in the landscape of nucleosome-packaged DNA in human skin cells. In particular, we describe how this accessory protein prioritizes, in space and time, which UV lesions in packaged DNA to target for repair by NER complexes, thus optimizing the repair process."

Accidents involving these snakes tend to be very severe or even lethal, causing peripheral nervous system depression with muscle paralysis and vasomotor instability. The only acceptable medical treatment for snakebite accidents is the administration of an antivenom, generally produced by immunising horses with the snake venom. Nonetheless, for what concerns the antielapidic serum production in Brazil, the total amount of venom available for horse immunisations is insufficient. This is mainly due to the small size of coral snake glands, their underground life style, combined with its very low survival rates in captivity. Moreover, cases of patients being intubated and ventilated as a consequence of antivenom shortage in USA have also been registered. In this work, we present an alternative method for the development of antielapidic serum, which does not rely upon snake capture. This serum was produced by a heterologous DNA prime—with a multiepitope DNA string coding for the most reactive epitopes from the most abundant toxins of M. corallinus, a coral snake which occupy highly populated areas in Brazil—followed by recombinant multiepitope protein boost immunisation of mice."

We searched for molecular markers of this cancer that might provide a better way to detect tumors at a curable stage and that might provide targets for new treatments. Chromosomal rearrangements that fuse two genes to produce a recombinant gene that enhances growth or spread of the cancer are particularly specific biomarkers and have been found in many cancers. By “deep” sequencing of the RNA molecules that carry genetic information in serous ovarian cancers, we discovered a rearrangement that fuses the same two neighboring genes in at least 15% of these tumors. The two fused genes are ESRRA, which encodes a key regulator of gene expression, and an essentially uncharacterized gene, C11orf20, that is normally adjacent to the ESRRA gene. Chromosomal rearrangements that recombine parts of two nearby genes or even parts of a single gene may be a common, important feature of the cancer genome that eludes detection by most approaches to characterizing cancer genomes."

Different DNA sourcing is often unavoidable in the large-scale association studies of multiple case and control sets. Here we describe methodological improvements to minimise such biases. These fall into two categories: improvements to the basic clustering methods for calling genotypes from fluorescence intensities, and use of “fuzzy” calls in association tests in order to make appropriate allowance for call uncertainty."

The centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A accumulates at the centromere, defining this region, and is maintained throughout cellular generations by epigenetic mechanisms in most eukaryotes. Previous studies have discovered many factors regulating both the maintenance and assembly of CENP-A at centromeres during mitosis in cultured cells, but the mode of regulation of CENP-A assembly during meiosis and mitosis in animal tissues is unknown. In this study, we use Drosophila melanogaster as an organismal model to investigate the timing and requirements for assembly of CID, the fly CENP-A homolog. We find that that CID is loaded at centromeres during telophase/G1 phase in brain stem and nonstem cells. In male meiosis, CID is loaded in two phases, during the first stages of meiosis I and after the second meiotic division. Meiosis I loading time is also conserved in females. We also report an unprecedented drop in CID levels after meiosis I and before meiosis II, which correlates with the timing of kinetochore reorientation. Additionally, we find that two essential centromere proteins (CAL1 and CENP-C) are necessary for CID assembly and chromosome segregation during meiosis. Our data demonstrate novel differential timing for CENP-A assembly during mitosis and meiosis in the whole organism."

We demonstrated that the T3S effector protein (VopO) of the enteric pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus induced robust actin stress fiber formation in infected host cells. Furthermore, this actin rearrangement induced barrier disruption in a colon epithelial cell line. Although many types of effector proteins have been reported, VopO does not share homology with previously reported effector proteins, and no putative functional motifs could be identified. Finally, we determined that the direct binding of VopO to a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) is a key step in the induction of stress fiber formation. These findings indicate that VopO plays a unique role in the pathogenicity of V. parahaemolyticus."

HIV requires a critical accessory protein, Vif, which targets APOBEC3 for degradation thereby shielding its genome from lethal mutagenesis. Previous in vitro studies have shown that in the absence of Vif, HIV can be hypermutated by APOBEC3. This potent restrictive function of APOBEC3 has generated strong interest in developing therapeutics based on the APOBEC3/Vif axis. Here we demonstrate in vivo that CCR5-tropic HIV can be efficiently restricted by APOBEC3. However, our results also show that CXCR4-tropic HIV can replicate independent of Vif and escape lethal restriction by APOBEC3. Specifically, we show that thymocytes have reduced expression of A3G and A3F and that direct injection of vif-defective HIV into the thymus results in viral replication and dissemination. Despite continued Vif-independent HIV replication, the virus remained sensitive to APOBEC3 mutagenesis and was rapidly restricted in tissues with higher A3G and A3F expression. Our results provide novel insight into the restriction of HIV in vivo and identify a potentially significant defect in the innate immune defenses that protect the host cell from pathogens."

Failure repress targets leads xbp1 cells enter permanent arrest senescence shortened lifespan .","Complex organisms depend on populations of non-dividing quiescent cells for their controlled growth, development and tissue renewal. These quiescent cells are maintained in a resting state, and divide only when stimulated to do so. Unscheduled exit or failure to enter this quiescent state results in uncontrolled proliferation and cancer. Yeast cells also enter a stable, protected and reversible quiescent state. As with higher cells, they exit the cell cycle from G1, reduce growth, conserve and recycle cellular contents. These similarities, and the fact that the mechanisms that start and stop the cell cycle are fundamentally conserved lead us to think that understanding how yeast enter, maintain and reverse quiescence could give important leads into the same processes in complex organisms. We show that yeast cells maintain G1 arrest by expressing a transcription factor that represses conserved activators (cyclins) and hundreds of other genes that are important for cell division and cell growth. Failure to repress some or all of these targets leads to extra cell divisions, prevents reversible arrest and shortens life span. Many Xbp1 targets are conserved cell cycle regulators and may also be actively repressed in the quiescent cells of more complex organisms."

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants have been traditionally used as neutral markers to trace ancient population migrations. As a result, the functional impact of human mtDNA population variants on gene regulation is poorly understood. To address this question, we analyzed available data of mtDNA gene expression pattern in a large group of individuals (454) from diverse human populations. Here, we show for the first time that the ancient migration of humans out of Africa correlated with differences in mitochondrial gene expression patterns, and could be explained by the activity of certain RNA-binding proteins. These findings suggest a major mitochondrial regulatory transition, as humans left Africa to populate the rest of the world."

For this, we employ a biophysically motivated computational model, in conjunction with over 300 TF motifs (binding specificities) as well as gene expression and DNA accessibility data from different developmental stages in Drosophila embryos. Our findings provide robust statistical evidence of the role played by TF-TF interactions in shaping genome-wide TF-DNA binding profiles, and thus in directing gene regulation. Our method allows us to go beyond simply recognizing the existence of such interactions, to quantifying their effects on TF occupancy. We are able to categorize the probable mechanisms of these effects as involving direct physical interactions versus accessibility-mediated indirect interactions, long-range versus short-range interactions, and cooperative versus antagonistic interactions. Our analysis reveals widespread evidence of combinatorial regulation present in recently generated ChIP data sets, and sets the stage for rich integrative models of the future that will predict cell type-specific TF occupancy values from sequence and expression data."

Abnormal DNA methylation and its subsequent effects on gene activity are a hallmark of cancer, yet when precisely these DNA methylation changes occur and how they contribute to the development of cancer remains largely unexplored. In this work we measure the methylation state of DNA at over 14,000 genes in over 1,475 samples, including normal and benign cells, invasive cancers, and metastatic cancer tissue. Using cervical cancer as a model, we show that gain of abnormal methylation at genes typically un-methylated in stem cells can be detected up to 3 years in advance of the appearance of pre-cancerous cells, while those genes typically methylated in stem cells lose this methylation progressively throughout cancer development. Furthermore, we discover that this process of methylation loss during cancer progression is a marker of poor disease outcome common to all four major women-specific cancers: breast, ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers. Finally we demonstrate the relationship between loss of methylation and cancer-specific over-production of a specific protein known to play an active role in removing methylation from DNA. Taken together these findings highlight the complex nature of DNA methylation dynamics in cancer development as well as their potential exploitation for clinical gain."

Although the major components in the pathway have been well studied in Drosophila and vertebrates, how the signaling is regulated by different modulators is not well understood. Here, we take advantage of a fly forward genetic screen to isolate Ubr3. We show that it is a novel modulator that regulates Hh signaling. Loss of ubr3 leads to Hh signaling defects in developing eyes of Drosophila, and affects eye, and somite and sensory neuron development in zebrafish. However, Hh signaling is not affected in all cells known to be dependent on Hh signaling as loss of ubr3 in the fly wing and zebrafish inner ear are not affected. This suggests that Ubr3 is a modulator that is only required in some Hh dependent organs/cells. We have shown that Ubr3 down-regulates the levels of Cos2 and its mammalian homolog Kif7, key negative regulators of Hh signaling, through poly-ubiquitination. The poly-ubiquitination of Cos2 by Ubr3 is enhanced by Hh activation, suggesting that it functions in a positive feedback that modulates Hh activation."

The genome sequence of these parasites has been decoded. Integration sites of retroviral transgenes into the chromosomes of schistosomes were investigated by high-throughput sequencing. Transgene integrations were mapped to the genome sequence of Schistosoma mansoni. Integrations were distributed apparently randomly across each of the eight chromosomes, including the seven autosomes and the sex chromosomes Z and W. Integration events of transgenes were characterized in chromosomes of cercariae that were progeny of schistosome eggs infected with pseudotyped virions. Also, transgenic cercariae were employed to infect mice and transgenes were detected in the F1 eggs. Together these findings confirmed vertical transmission of transgenes through the schistosome germline, through both the asexual and the sexual reproductive phases of the developmental cycle. Moreover, germline-transmitted retroviral transgenes encoding drug resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotics allowed schistosomes to survive toxic concentrations of the antibiotic G418. These findings represent the first reports of wide-scale insertional mutagenesis of schistosome chromosomes and vertical transmission of a transgene through the schistosome germline."

In total, 110 metabolites measured from blood samples of 47 individuals were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Dynamic biomarker candidates could be selected based on the amplitudes of changes in metabolite concentrations and the significance of statistical hypothesis testing.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a double stranded DNA virus which packages a single-stranded RNA pregenome (pgRNA) that is reverse transcribed within the capsid. RNA packaging requires a phosphorylated form of the HBV capsid protein's RNA-binding carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Although the capsid has been well studied, the internal structures, the CTDs and the packaged RNA, are poorly characterized. By using in vitro reassembly, we have generated empty and pgRNA-filled capsids using phosphorylation-mimic and unphosphorylated forms of the capsid protein. Using cryo-EM image reconstruction, we have been able to show the structure of encapsidated pgRNA and, independently, the CTD in the absence of RNA to visualize early stages of the HBV assembly. We showed that the structural organization of the CTD changes as a function of the phosphorylation. Changes in CTD structure affect the structure of the encapsidated pgRNA, changing it from thin segments of density in the phosphorylated state, suggestive of single-stranded RNA, to thick rope-like structures consistent with duplex nucleic acid in the unphosphorylated state."

An intriguing feature of DNA methylation in plants is that its pattern can be inherited over multiple generations at high fidelity in a Mendelian manner. However, mechanisms controlling the trans-generational DNA methylation dynamics are largely unknown. Arabidopsis mutants of a chromatin remodeler gene DDM1 (Decrease in DNA Methylation 1) show drastic reduction of DNA methylation in transposons and repeats, and also show progressive changes in developmental phenotypes during propagation through self-pollination. We now show using whole genome DNA methylation sequencing that upon repeated selfing, the ddm1 mutation induces an ectopic accumulation of DNA methylation at hundreds of loci. Remarkably, even in the wild type background, the analogous de novo increase of DNA methylation can be induced in trans by chromosomes with reduced DNA methylation. Collectively, our findings support a model to explain the transgenerational DNA methylation redistribution by genome-wide negative feedback, which should be important for balanced differentiation of DNA methylation states within the genome."

The study, which was carried out in preparation for a vector control campaign, allowed to discriminate areas where tsetse presence was certain, likely or unlikely Habitat degradation due to agricultural activities seemed to play a pivotal role in determining the infestation by tsetse since settled areas had low probabilities for both species which was expected in this group. Application of this model will help reduce the cost of delineating tsetse infested areas in other parts of Zimbabwe and may also be useful for other PATTEC national initiatives in other African countries at a time when funding for tsetse control programmes is reduced."

Patterns assortative mating low incidence invasive sperm occurring conspecific mating indicative ongoing intra - specific sexual conflict results inter - species reproductive incompatibility .","The sexes have divergent reproductive interests, and conflict arising from this disparity can drive the rapid evolution of reproductive traits and promote speciation. Here we describe a unique reproductive barrier in Caenorhabditis nematodes that is induced by sperm. We found that mating between species can sterilize maternal worms and even cause premature death, and we were able to attribute this phenomenon directly to the sperm themselves. Sperm from other species can displace sperm from the same species and, in some cases, can invade inappropriate parts of the maternal reproductive system and even their non-reproductive tissues. We find that mating to males of another species harms females far more than does within-species mating. Overall, our observations are consistent with ongoing sexual conflict between the sexes within species, arising as a byproduct of sperm competition among the gametes of different males. Finally, patterns of assortative mating indicate that mating behaviours that reduce the likelihood of costly inter-species mating have evolved in this group of animals. These findings support an important role of sexual selection and gametic interactions contributing to reproductive boundaries between species, as predicted by evolutionary theory."

We developed two M. leprae-specific quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays and tested their utility as biological markers of M. leprae viability in tissue specimens. These assays could detect high viability of bacilli growing in immunosuppressed mice as well as the inhibitory effects of anti-leprosy drug treatment, or of the host immune system in immunocompetent mice. The RNA preparations were also successfully used for detection of host gene expression. The application of these assays to various experimental models would benefit characterization of the infection or novel drug screening. Furthermore, because these assays utilize fixed tissues, their potential application to clinical and field settings could enable monitoring of M. leprae viability in conjunction with the host immune response during treatment."

The reaction catalyzed by GlmUMtb (an enzyme with acetyltransferase and uridyltransferase activities) generates UDP-GlcNAc, a central nucleotide-sugar building block of the cell wall. Apart from cell wall synthesis UDP-GlcNAc is an essential metabolite participating in other cellular processes including disaccharide linker and mycothiol biosynthesis. GlmUMtb shares very little sequence similarity with eukaryotic acetyltransferase and uridyltransferase enzymes. Many pathogens have alternative pathway(s) for foraging GlcNAc from the host. The present study was undertaken to see the effects of depleting GlmUMtb on pathogen survival in the host animal. We have generated a conditional gene replacement mutant of glmUMtb and find that depletion of GlmUMtb at any stage of bacterial growth or in mice infected with Mtb including a well-established infection, results in irreversible bacterial death due to perturbation of cell wall synthesis. We have developed a novel anti-GlmUMtb inhibitor (Oxa33), identified its binding site on GlmUMtb, and shown its specificity for GlmUMtb. The study demonstrates that GlmUMtb is a promising target for therapeutic intervention and Oxa33 can be pursued as a lead molecule."

In mice, fibroblastic reticular cells are known to regulate T-cell activation, proliferation, and function, but in humans, they are poorly understood. We investigated interactions between human T cells and human fibroblastic reticular cells from tonsils and lymph nodes. When T cells were activated in the presence of human fibroblastic reticular cells, their proliferation and differentiation were reduced, without altering effector T-cell function, shown through cytokine production. We identified 4 molecular mechanisms that were responsible, concurrently used by all human fibroblast donors tested, and reversible upon addition of specific inhibitors to the cocultures. To establish the relevance of this finding outside of in vitro coculture, we showed that T-cell proliferation was increased in live human tonsil tissue slices when the fibroblastic reticular cell inhibitors were added. This work demonstrates that human fibroblastic reticular cells regulate T-cell activation and provides new information on the mechanisms used, which may be useful to design clinical strategies that improve T-cell responses."

IFN-I exert antiviral effector functions and orchestrate antiviral immunity. IFN-I are induced early after infection, upon sensing of viral particles or infected cells by immune receptors. Intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLR) are selectively expressed in specialized immune cell types such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), enabling them to copiously produce IFN-I upon detection of engulfed viral nucleic acids. pDC or intracellular TLR have been reported to be crucial for resistance to experimental infections with many viruses in mice but dispensable for resistance to natural infections in humans. Our aim was to investigate this puzzling difference. Mice deficient for TLR activity mounted strong IFN-I responses despite producing very low IFN-I levels and controlled the infection by a moderate dose of murine cytomegalovirus much better than mice deficient for IFN-I responses. Deficient TLR responses could be compensated by direct recognition of infected cells by natural killer cells. Hence, we identified experimental conditions in mice mimicking the lack of requirement of TLR functions for antiviral defense observed in humans. We used these experimental models to advance our basic understanding of antiviral immunity in a way that might help improve treatments for patients."

ILCs have emerged as central players in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, and correlated with the pathogenesis and progression of multiple human diseases. It is reported that ILCs are depleted in HIV-1 infected patients. However, it is not clear whether HIV-1 can infect ILCs and how ILCs are depleted during HIV-1 infection. Here, we find that ILC1s consist CD4+ and CD4- subsets and both are present in various human lymphoid organs. We show that HIV-1 can directly infect CD4+ ILC1s. HIV-1 infection leads to activation, depletion and functional impairment of ILC1s in humans and in humanized mice in vivo. Blocking IFN-I signaling prevents HIV-1-induced apoptosis of ILC1s both in vitro and in humanized mice in vivo. Our study reveals the CD4+ ILC1 population as a new target for HIV-1 infection and identifies an IFN-I mediated mechanism of ILC1 depletion during chronic HIV-1 infection."

Improving diagnostic performance in this area is a major challenge and necessitates the development and evaluation of new efficient, accurate methods. According to the kinetics of dengue infection in serum, virus isolation and nucleic acid or antigen detection are the most specific diagnostic methods during the early acute stage of disease; serology is often used for diagnosis later in the course of infection. In order to provide an earlier and reliable dating of the dengue infection, few recent studies showed that the detection of specific IgA in the serum is a useful diagnostic parameter. Exploring that new approach, this study was carried out to assess the performance of a Platelia Dengue IgA Capture assay for dengue infection detection, newly developed by Bio-Rad, using 184 well-characterized samples provided by the French Guiana NRC sera collection of the Institut Pasteur in French Guiana. This study revealed good overall performances of this test, constituting promising assistance in dengue diagnosis, especially in hyper-endemic countries."

We took advantage of a novel host–pathogen system involving a bacterial pathogen (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, or MG) and a songbird host, the House Finch, to study genome-wide changes during a host-shift. Around 1994, biologists noticed that House Finches were contracting conjunctivitis and MG from poultry was discovered to be the cause. The resulting epizootic was one of the best documented for a wildlife species, partly as a result of thousands of citizen science observers. We sequenced the genomes of 12 House Finch MG strains sampled throughout the epizootic, from 1994–2007, as well as four additional putatively ancestral poultry MG strains. Using this serial sample, we estimate a remarkably high rate of substitution, consistent with past implications that mycoplasmas are among the fastest evolving bacteria. We also find that an array of likely phage-derived sequences known as CRISPRs has degraded and ceased to recruit new repeats in the House Finch MG strains, as compared to the poultry strains in which it is diverse and rapidly evolving. This suggests that phage dynamics might be important in the dynamics of MG infection."

A subset of these dynamic mutations known as fragile sites can be seen as a break or gap on the chromosome when cells are cultured under specific conditions. To date eight folate-sensitive fragile sites (FSFS) have been characterized, and all are due to CGG-repeat expansions within the 5′ UTR or promoter region of the respective gene. When the repeat expands in size, it becomes hypermethylated and the adjacent gene or genes are transcriptionally silenced. For at least four of the eight known fragile sites this silencing of the associated gene(s) lead to intellectual disability syndromes such as fragile X. In this work we describe molecular characterization of an autosomal FSFS called FRA2A on chromosome 2. As the molecular cause of FRA2A, we identify an expansion of a CGG repeat which subsequently results in silencing of the neighbouring gene AFF3. This gene is one of the four autosomal paralogss of the AFF2/FMR2 gene which, when mutated, is the cause of the FRAXE syndrome. We find that FRA2A expression is associated with highly variable developmental anomalies in the three FRA2A families studied."

CD8 T lymphocytes are key components of the cellular immunity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread pathogen that cause severe illness and poor outcome in immunocompromised hosts such as transplant recipients and HIV-infected patients. In this study we characterized a population of non-conventional CD8 T lymphocytes directed against the viral protein UL40 and presented by the non-classical HLA-E molecules in blood samples from HCMV seropositive hosts. This immune response was detectable in around 30% of hosts, may represent up to 38% of total blood CD8 T lymphocytes, persists for life and thus seems to belong to the common immune arsenal against HCMV. Genetic factors related to the host and to the different strains of HCMV are critical parameters for the existence of this immune subset. Although specifically induced in response to HCMV infection, a key feature of these cells is their potential ability to be also responsive against multiple HLA molecules. In conclusion, HCMV infection frequently leads to the long-term persistence of a large subset of lymphocytes with potential side effect requiring attention in contexts such as autoimmunity and transplantation."

Despite considerable effort, development of a successful vaccine against dengue virus (DENV) has been challenging due to the co-circulation of the four DENV serotypes in endemic areas—to which humans develop distinct immune responses, and the increased risk of severe disease in those with pre-existing immunity to one serotype when they are infected with a different serotype. In this study, we investigated the responses in macaques to vaccination with the tetravalent, live-attenuated vaccine, TDV, by different doses and routes of vaccine administration. We identify changes in macaque gene expression that occurred in the days immediately following vaccination with TDV, a time-period that is difficult to study during natural infection. The gene expression response was characterized by features of the innate immune response to virus, notably the type I interferon response, and began the day after TDV vaccination. This response correlated with the development of neutralizing antibodies, which means that it might serve as an early indicator of a subsequent protective immune response to dengue vaccines."

EBV infection of resting B-lymphocytes drives them to proliferate as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), an in vitro model of PTLD. LCLs express a limited EBV gene repertoire, including six nuclear proteins (EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and LP), three integral membrane proteins (LMP1, 2A, and 2B), and more than 30 micro RNAs. EBNA2 and the EBNA3 proteins are transcription factors that regulate viral and cell gene expression through the cell DNA binding protein RBPJ. In this study, we established LCLs transformed by recombinant EBV genomes in which a Flag-HA epitope tag is fused in-frame to the C-terminus of EBNA3A, EBNA3B or EBNA3C. Using these LCLs, we purified endogenous EBNA3 complexes and identified the USP46 deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and its associated chaperones WDR48 and WDR20 as EBNA3 binding proteins. We find that EBNA3s interact primarily with the WDR48 protein and that loss of WDR48 interaction with EBNA3A or EBNA3C impairs LCL growth. This study represents the first characterization of EBNA3 complexes from LCLs and implicates the USP46 DUB complex in EBNA3 mediated gene regulation."

Experimental evidence supports a role for sphingolipids in several common complex chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, or neurological disease processes. Therefore, sphingolipids represent novel and important intermediate phenotypes for genetic analysis, and discovering the genetic variants that influence their circulating concentrations is an important step towards understanding how the genetic control of sphingolipids might contribute to common human disease.

NSs is a non-structural bunyavirus protein with multiple functions that acts as an avirulence determinant and silencing suppressor. In this study, we identified a new function of NSs as a conserved manipulator of vector behavior via plant. NSs suppresses jasmonate-mediated plant immunity against thrips by directly interacting with several homologs of MYC transcription factors, the core regulators of the jasmonate-signaling pathway. This hijacking by NSs enhances thrips preference and performance. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that MYC2 is a convergent target that plant pathogens manipulate to promote their survival in plants."

In addition to the classic cardiac involvement, orally-infected patient progress to a highly symptomatic disease and increased mortality rate (8–35%), surpassing the calculated mortality produced by the disease resulting from the biting of infected insect vectors (5–10%). Here, we explored by in vivo bioluminescent images, qPCR and fluorescence microscopy the primary site of parasite entry and multiplication in oral infection (OI). Our results clearly demonstrated that the oral cavity is the main T. cruzi target region in OI, leading to parasite multiplication at the nasal cavity and parasite dissemination to the brain and peripheral tissues. Interestingly, facial edema, paraesthesia of the tongue, gingivitis and dry cough were already described in affected patients. These findings might be associated to our present data, which describe for the first time the nasomaxillary region as the main target tissue following oral T. cruzi infection."

Drug resistance has been described and may prevent eradication of the disease. The infectious agent causing leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae, is not growing in vitro and antibiotic susceptibility testing is possible only in the mouse footpad model that requires a one year experiment. Consequently this testing is rarely done and antibiotic resistance rates in leprosy are unknown. This is the reason why we endeavored to set a new diagnosis test that detects for antibiotic resistance in M. leprae. The test is based on the method of a DNA strip test with a multiplex PCR followed by reverse hybridization. It was developed as an easy-to-use test and it will be available in endemic countries, where these kinds of strip tests are already used for detection of drug resistance in tuberculosis. The results of the new test, Genotype LepraeDR, performed on 120 M. leprae strains were concordant with those of the standard PCR sequencing and mouse footpad susceptibility testing."

Like all viruses, HCMV must have a way to leave the host cell, so that it can infect new cells. Moreover, as a member of the herpesvirus family, HCMV replicates its DNA in the nucleus, so it must have mechanisms to ensure that its genetic material can exit from the nucleus (nuclear egress). HCMV encodes a protein kinase, UL97, which is required for efficient nuclear egress. We found that UL97 aids nuclear egress by mimicking a host cell enzyme that normally helps break down a protein meshwork in the nucleus during cell division. The enzyme activity of UL97 pokes holes in the meshwork that allow nascent HCMV virions to gain access to the nuclear membrane. UL97 is also an important target for drugs for treating HCMV disease. This work not only helps explain how these drugs act, but also highlights the potential of targeting nuclear egress for the discovery of new drugs."

Angiogenesis requires enhanced survival, proliferation, and motility of the vascular endothelial cells. Crucial signaling endpoints in VEGF-mediated angiogenic response include elevation in intracellular calcium and the activation of the proteins ERK1 and 2 (ERK1/2). In this study, we have developed a novel computer model for the activation of ERK1/2 and calcium downstream of VEGF receptor type 2 (VEGFR2). Our model is the first of its kind to incorporate and investigate the consequences of calcium elevation and the role of a cellular lipid modifier known as sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1). We also utilize the model to simulate therapeutic strategies targeting VEGF signaling to ERK1/2 indicating inefficiency of single therapies known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target receptor phosphorylation. Computer simulations indicate that combination therapy is essential for effective blockade of this important pathway. Our results have important implications for human diseases such as cancer where plethora of anti-VEGF therapies are currently employed. Overall, our computer model sheds new light on a complex feedback involving SphK1 and calcium that radically alters the response of cells to VEGF."

However, its exact role and how it regulates host innate immune responses have not been fully explained. Herein, we show that PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of GRA7 is essential for the interaction between GRA7 and ASC or PLD1, which can promote antimicrobial defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Notably, PKCα specifically phosphorylated Ser52 and Ser135 of GRA7 in vitro and in vivo, indicating that GRA7 is a substrate of PKCα. The N-terminal of GRA7 (GRA7-I) was sufficient for interaction with the PYD domain of ASC, which is capable of ASC oligomerization and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, GRA7-III interacted with the PX domain of PLD1, facilitating its enzyme activity, phago-lysosomal maturation, and subsequent antimicrobial activity in a GRA7 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Interestingly, phosphomimetic mutation in GRA7 overcame the need for PKCα. Collectively, these results provide novel insight into how GRA7 can promote ASC and PLD1 activation in a PKCα-dependent manner as an antimicrobial host defense mechanism."

HSV-1 establishes latency in trigeminal ganglia (TG) sensory neurons. HSV-1 genomes remain as extrachromosomal DNA; their initial interaction with the nuclear architecture is likely to determine commitment toward the lytic or the latent transcriptional program. Among the major nuclear components that influence the infection process the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) play a major role as nuclear relays of the intrinsic antiviral response. In this study, using infected mice and cultured mouse primary TG neuron models, as well as human TGs, we investigated the interaction between HSV-1 genomes and the nuclear environment in individual neurons. We found that the inability of HSV-1 to initiate a lytic program at the initial stages of infection led to the formation of latency-associated viral DNA-containing PML-NBs (vDCP-NBs), or another pattern if the type 1 interferon pathway was activated prior to infection. vDCP-NB–like structures were also present in neurons of latently infected human TGs, designating PML-NBs as major nuclear components involved in the control of HSV-1 latency for the entire life of an individual."

The types of behaviors controlled by quorum sensing are typically unproductive when performed by a single bacterium acting alone but become effective when undertaken in unison by the group. Importantly, quorum sensing controls virulence and biofilm formation in many globally important pathogens. Thus, small molecules that modulate quorum sensing could be promising new antimicrobials. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to study LuxO, the central quorum sensing regulator in Vibrio cholerae and related bacteria. We find that LuxO activity is controlled during quorum sensing by a mechanism that entails occlusion of the LuxO active site by a linker region within the protein. The small molecule AzaU also inhibits LuxO and, in so doing, down-regulates V. cholerae virulence. Our studies show that AzaU binds to the LuxO active site, unexpectedly mimicking aspects of the natural regulatory mechanism."

We recently found that immune cells known as neutrophils use physical forces to regulate this process. Actin polymerization-based protrusion stretches the plasma membrane, and this increased membrane tension acts as a long-range inhibitor of actin-based protrusions elsewhere in the cell. Here we investigate how membrane tension limits protrusion. We demonstrate that the magnitude of actin network assembly in neutrophils is determined by a mechanosensory biochemical cascade that converts increases in membrane tension into decreases in protrusion. Specifically, we show that increasing plasma membrane tension acts through a pathway containing the phospholipase D2 (PLD2) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) to limit actin network assembly. Without this negative feedback pathway, neutrophils exhibit larger leading edges, higher membrane tension, and profoundly defective chemotaxis. Mathematical modeling indicates that this feedback circuit is a favorable topology to enable competition between protrusions during neutrophil polarization. Our work shows how biochemical signals, physical forces, and the cytoskeleton can collaborate to generate large-scale cellular organization."

Similarly, when grasping the same object, they also perceive its shape. In general, the perceived shape is identical in these two scenarios, illustrating modality invariance, an important type of perceptual constancy. Modality invariance suggests that people infer a modality-independent, conceptual representation that is the same regardless of the modality used to sense the environment. If so, how do people infer modality-independent representations from modality-specific sensory signals? We present a hypothesis about the components that any system will include if it infers modality-independent representations from sensory signals. This hypothesis is instantiated in a computational model that infers object shape representations from visual or haptic (i.e., active touch) signals. The model shows perfect modality invariance—it infers the same shape representations regardless of the sensory modality used to sense objects. The model also provides a highly accurate account of data collected in an experiment in which people judged the similarity of pairs of objects that were viewed, grasped, or both. Conceptually, our research contributes to our understanding of modality invariance. Methodologically, it contributes to cognitive modeling by showing how symbolic and statistical approaches can be combined in order to understand aspects of human perception."

While it is associated with numerous co-morbidities, type 2 diabetes mellitus represents one of the major life-threatening, obesity-related conditions. Over the last years, it has become clear that during the course of obesity development not only does fat mass increase, but also fat composition changes qualitatively, leading to an influx of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, into adipose tissue. Macrophages in turn secrete inflammatory mediators, which inhibit insulin action in skeletal muscle, liver, and even the central nervous system to ultimately cause insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. However, the effect of insulin action and resistance in these inflammatory cell types themselves has not been addressed. To this end, we have generated and analyzed mice with inactivation of the insulin receptor specifically in myeloid cell-derived, inflammatory cells. Surprisingly, these animals are protected from the development of obesity-associated deterioration of glucose metabolism, thereby defining insulin action in inflammatory cells as a novel and promising target for therapeutic intervention against obesity-associated diabetes mellitus."

Here, we characterize a novel defective RNA derived from the PB2 segment of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. This RNA encodes a 10 kDa peptide (PB2Δ) which activates type I interferon (IFN) responses through direct interaction with the adapter protein MAVS, a key component of the RIG-I-dependent IFN induction. This is the first time that such a function was described for a defective RNA-encoded protein, a finding that has several important implications with regard to deciphering viral protein functions and options for immunostimulatory approaches.

The germline stem cell niche of the Drosophila ovary has been a long-standing model for the analysis of the interactions between stem cells and niche cells. Surprisingly little is known, however, about the mechanisms that pattern this niche, leading to the specification of different niche cell types and to their distinct arrangement around the stem cells. The observation that Tj is expressed at different levels in the different cell types of the niche motivated us to ask what contribution this transcription factor makes to the formation of the niche. Our data suggest that Tj activity is needed for the presence of escort cells and for the correct specification of cap cells but appears to be dispensable for the formation of terminal filament cells in the germline stem cell niche. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the establishment of the cap cell fate depends on the cooperation between Tj and the N signaling pathway. We conclude that Tj regulates the germline stem cell carrying capacity of the niche by controlling the fate and the spatial arrangement of niche cells."

These CYP enzymes break down insecticides into non-toxic forms that can be readily excreted. An increase of CYP-mediated detoxification is commonly found in pyrethroid resistant Aedes aegypti, however the link between specific CYPs and the resistance loci have not been clearly established for this species. In this study, we measured the expression levels of nine candidate CYPs in two strains highly resistant to permethrin: SP, a field collected strain that was selected with permethrin for high levels of resistance and CKR, a strain that contains the resistance mechanisms from SP, but that is congenic (i.e. has the genetic background) to the insecticide susceptible strain, ROCK. We found seven overexpressed CYPs in SP and four in CKR, confirming their involvement in resistance. Next, we sequenced the CYP genes (with the exception of the duplicated ones) to determine if the genes themselves are located in the resistance locus (meaning their expression is cis-regulated) or not (meaning their expression is trans-regulated). We found no reduced polymorphisms in any of the resistant strain (SP) CYPs, suggesting that the overexpression of these CYPs (and thus CYP-mediated resistance) is trans-regulated."

Yet, their analysis and representation is still an open problem. Recent experimental and computational progress yields networks of increased size and complexity. There are, for example, small- and large-scale interaction networks, regulatory networks, genetic networks, protein-ligand interaction networks, and homology networks analyzed and published regularly. A common way to access the information in a network is though direct visualization, but this fails as it often just results in “fur balls” from which little insight can be gathered. On the other hand, clustering techniques manage to avoid the problems caused by the large number of nodes and even larger number of edges by coarse-graining the networks and thus abstracting details. But these also fail, since, in fact, much of the biology lies in the details. This work presents a novel methodology for analyzing and representing networks. Power Graphs are a lossless representation of networks, which reduces network complexity by explicitly representing re-occurring network motifs. Moreover, power graphs can be clearly visualized: they compress up to 90% of the edges in biological networks and are applicable to all types of networks such as protein interaction, regulatory networks, or homology networks."

Although current human infections are a result of human-macaque contact, there is a potential for P. knowlesi to be transmitted solely among humans. The authors developed a multi-host, multi-site transmission model to assess the likelihood of this happening due to increased human-macaque contact as a consequence of deforestation, population growth, and land-use change. How effective currently available malaria control measures were against P. knowlesi was also an important issue that was explored using the model. Although the model predicts that conventional control measures will be sufficient against P. knowlesi, with the push to eliminate malaria by the end of 2015, it is crucial to be aware of zoonotic malarias which may undermine such efforts."

Here, we used an HSPC-based approach to redirect and enhance host immunity against HIV-1. We engineered HSPCs to carry chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) genes that detect and destroy HIV-infected cells. CAR therapy has shown huge potential in the treatment of cancer, but has only been applied in peripheral blood T-cells. HSPC-based CAR therapy has several benefits over T cell gene therapy, as it allows for normal T cell development, selection, and persistence of the engineered cells for the lifetime of the patient. We used a CAR molecule that hijacks the essential interaction between the virus and the cell surface molecule CD4 to redirect HSPC-derived T-cells against infected cells. We observed >2 years of stable production of CAR-expressing cells without any adverse events, and wide distribution of these cells in lymphoid tissues and gastrointestinal tract, which are major anatomic sites for HIV replication and persistence in suppressed patients. Most importantly, HSPC-derived CAR T-cells functionally responded to infected cells. This study demonstrates for the first time the safety and feasibility of HSPC based therapy utilizing an HIV-specific CAR for suppressed HIV infection."

We used the three transcription factors Sp1, Sp2 and Sp3 as a paradigm for investigating this question. All three proteins are ubiquitously expressed, and they share glutamine-rich domains as well as a conserved bona fide zinc finger DNA binding domain. Yet, each of the three proteins carries out unique functions in vivo, and each is absolutely essential for mouse development. By genome-wide binding analysis, we found that Sp1 and Sp3 on the one hand, and Sp2 on the other hand engage completely different protein domains for their genomic binding site selection. Most strikingly, the zinc finger domain of Sp2 is dispensable for recruitment to its target sites in vivo. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that the histone-fold protein Nf-y is necessary for recruitment of Sp2. Conversely, Sp2 potentiates Nf-y binding showing that binding of Sp2 and Nf-y to shared sites is mutually dependent. Our findings uncover an unexpected mechanistic diversity in promoter recognition by seemingly similar transcription factors. This work has broader implications for our understanding of how members of other multi-protein transcription factor families could achieve specificity."

This control can be exerted by metabolites acting as regulatory signals on a class of metabolic enzymes with dual functions as regulators of gene expression. However, little is known about how metabolic signals affect the balance between enzymatic and regulatory roles of these proteins. Here, we report an example of a protein with dual functions in gene expression and carbon metabolism. The chloroplast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is well-known to produce activated di-carbon precursors for fatty acid, which is required for lipid synthesis. Our results show that a subunit of this enzyme forms ribonucleoprotein particles and influences chloroplast mRNA translation. Conversely, RNA binding affects pyruvate dehydrogenase (metabolic) activity. These findings offer insight into how intracellular metabolic signaling and gene expression are reciprocally regulated during membrane biogenesis. In addition, our results suggest that these dual roles of the protein might exist in evolutionary distant organisms ranging from cyanobacteria to humans."

In particular, until now no experimental evidence has been provided identifying the catalytic center of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is absolutely essential for the virus life cycle due to its role in replicating and transcribing the viral negative-sense RNA genome. Based on a comparison to related negative-sense RNA viruses from other virus families we identified a putative catalytic center within the Ebola virus polymerase, and provide the experimental evidence that the Ebola virus polymerase indeed utilizes a classical GDNQ motif for both genome replication and transcription. This finding not only increases our knowledge regarding the molecular biology of Ebola viruses, but also defines a molecular target for the development of antivirals against this deadly virus."

Bumblebees are important tomato pollinators, but do not transmit this virus. We propose that under natural conditions, helping host reproduction by encouraging bee visitation might represent a ‘payback’ by the virus to susceptible hosts. Although tomato flowers can give rise to seed through self-fertilization, bumblebee-mediated ‘buzz-pollination’ enhances this, increasing the number of seeds produced per fruit. Buzz-pollination further favors reproductive success of a plant by facilitating pollen export. Mathematical modeling suggests that if self-fertilization by infected plants, as well as pollen transfer from these plants (cross-fertilization) to surrounding plants is increased, this might favor reproduction of susceptible over that of resistant plants. This raises the possibility that under natural conditions some viruses might enhance competitiveness of susceptible plants and inhibit the emergence of resistant plant strains. We speculate that it may be in a virus’ interest to pay back a susceptible host by enhancing its attractiveness to pollinators, which will likely increase fertilization rates and the dissemination of susceptible plant pollen and may compensate for a decreased yield of seeds on the virus-infected plants."

Mass vaccination programs have shown promise for controlling zoonoses in reservoir populations and, in turn, lessening the health burden posed to neighboring human populations. Despite some significant successes, major logistical challenges remain for programs that seek to establish and maintain herd immunity in free-ranging animal populations. Specifically, limited host access and costs associated with vaccine distribution may hinder efforts to vaccinate a host population and preempt spillover of a zoonotic pathogen. We use mathematical models, parameterized with data from campaigns in the US that target rabies in wildlife, to illustrate how transmissible vaccines can overcome these challenges. Specifically, we find levels of vaccine transmission necessary to boost vaccination efforts that seek to preempt the spread of rabies, and also predict the cost savings that could be realized with a transmissible vaccine."

Among the factors explaining                    this phenotypic polymorphism, parasite features are important contributors. One                    approach to identify them consists in characterizing the gene expression                    profiles throughout the life cycle. In a recent study, the transcriptome of 3                        Leishmania species was compared and this revealed                    species-specific differences, albeit in a low number.

In this study, we found that Th-POK is expressed in the luminal, but not the basal epithelial cells in the mammary glands. Despite the lineage restricted expression in the mammary glands, Th-POK is dispensable for mammary epithelial cell lineage specification and mammary gland development. Rather, Th-POK regulates the onset of lactation and milk lipid production via mammary epithelial cell autonomous mechanisms, suggesting that Th-POK exerts distinct functions in a tissue specific manner. Th-POK regulates the expression of insulin receptor sunstrate-1 and insulin-induced mTOR-SREBP pathway activation and lipid biosynthesis in the mammary alveolar cells at lactation. Thus, Th-POK functions as an important metabolic regulator in the lactating mammary glands, in addition to its well documented cell fate specification functions in T cell development."

Although some neurons use only graded voltage signals, most convert these signals into discrete-time action potentials. Yet the costs and benefits associated with such a switch in signalling mechanism are largely unexplored. We investigate why the conversion of graded potentials to action potentials is accompanied by substantial information loss and how this changes energy efficiency. Action potentials are generated by a large cohort of noisy Na+ channels. We show that this channel noise and the added non-linearity of Na+ channels destroy input information provided by graded generator potentials. Furthermore, action potentials themselves cause information loss due to their finite widths because the neuron is oblivious to the input that is arriving during an action potential. Consequently, neurons with high firing rates lose a large amount of the information in their inputs. The additional cost incurred by voltage-gated Na+ channels also means that action potentials can encode less information per unit energy, proving metabolically inefficient, and suggesting penalisation of high firing rates in the nervous system."

Specialized treatment structures were opened rapidly, generally in cities or large villages, and decentralized treatment units or rehydration points were gradually opened later on. To gain insight into the true burden of the cholera outbreak in the community and on potential geographical differences due to accessibility, we conducted a survey in April–May 2011 in a large rural area across four mountainous districts in the Nord department. We interviewed 3,187 households, corresponding to 16,900 individuals, of whom 2,034 (12%) had had diarrhea, probably cholera, since the beginning of the outbreak. The two most remote districts showed higher proportions of population affected by the disease, up to 16.2%, and higher proportions of deaths among patients with probable cholera, up to 15.2%, than the two districts with better accessibility. Remote populations, older patients, severe cases and those not seeking care were at increased risk of dying of the disease. These results show the very high burden of the cholera outbreak in remote areas, emphasizing the need to develop strategies to rapidly provide treatment and prevention measures in remote communities."

Mass de-worming treatments of school children are an important strategy to reduce illness caused by these infections in communities without access to clean water and sanitation. Few studies have examined the effect of repeated mass treatments in the long-term in controlling these infections. The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of the drug ivermectin used for the control of onchocerciasis (river blindness), that has important effects against intestinal worms, on the epidemiology of intestinal worms in children when administered repeatedly for 15–17 years. We compared the epidemiology of infections between children living in communities that received ivermectin with communities that never received the drug. The data suggest that ivermectin has important differential effects on intestinal worms with a greater impact on infections with Trichuris trichiura and little impact on Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworms infections. Our data suggest that long-term ivermectin treatments may provide health benefits through effects on T. trichiura infections but that the addition of second de-worming drug such as albendazole may be required for the control of other intestinal worm infections."

For some antibiotics, bacteria develop resistance rapidly, while for other antibiotics this process can be very slow. The causes of such differences in evolutionary dynamics between drugs remain poorly understood. Determining how these mutations that confer drug resistance affect bacterial fitness is a crucial requirement for developing predictions about evolution. In this study, we systematically measured the fitness effects of thousands of mutations that mimic all viable spontaneous gene disruptions in the bacterium Escherichia coli, when exposed to eight different antibiotics that represent the main modes of drug action. We find that the overall magnitude of these fitness effects varies enormously among antibiotics and show that this phenomenon is explained by the drug-specific response of bacteria to small changes in drug dose. We further show that, unlike the fitness effects—which vary greatly—the changes in tolerated drug concentration generated by resistance-conferring mutations are similar for most drugs, with the notable exception of an outlier drug called nitrofurantoin (which has an extremely small tolerated drug concentration range). Using a combination of mathematical modeling and evolution experiments, we propose new quantitative measures that enable partial predictions about how quickly resistance to a given drug will evolve and whether it will reproducibly occur by exploiting the same mutations."

We show that the residual replication of laboratory strains is predominantly mediated by a LEDGF/p75-related protein, HRP-2. Interestingly, the recently developed HIV-1 IN inhibitors that target the LEDGF/p75-IN interaction interface, LEDGINs, remain active even in the absence of LEDGF/p75. We demonstrate that LEDGINs efficiently block the interaction between IN and HRP-2. In case HIV-1 would be able to bypass LEDGF/p75-dependent replication using HRP-2 as an alternative tether, LEDGINs would remain fully active."

In this article, we describe a new method to design and predict bacterial communities that alter the plant host response to phosphate starvation. The method uses plant–bacterium binary-association assays to define groups of bacteria that elicit similar effects on the host plant. By constructing partially overlapping bacterial communities, we demonstrated that it is possible to modify phosphate accumulation in the plant shoot and the induction of plant phosphate starvation genes in a controlled manner. We found that bacterial colonization of the plant root does not predict the capacity to produce this phenotype. We evaluated the predictive performance of different statistical models and identified one best able to predict the behavior of untested communities. Our work demonstrates that studying a subset of all possible bacterial communities is sufficient to anticipate the outcome of novel bacterial combinations, and we establish that it is possible to deduce causality between microbiome composition and host phenotypes in complex systems."

In contrast to male meiosis that takes place continuously, a unique feature of female meiosis in mammals is the long arrest in meiosis I, which lasts up to 50 years in humans. Because the size of the germ cell pool determines the reproductive lifespan of females, it is important to discover mechanisms preserving the germ cell pool during the lengthy meiotic arrest. In this study, we examined the physiological role of a member of the PP2A-like serine/threonine phosphatase subfamily, protein phosphatase 6, in mouse oocytes during ovarian follicular development. This is the first study linking PP6 to the maintenance of the female germ cell pool and fertility. We find PP6 is an indispensable protector of arrested oocytes by safeguarding genomic integrity during their dormancy in the mouse ovary."

The locations that a given regulatory protein will bind, and the strength or frequency of such binding at an individual location, can vary depending on the cell type. We can profile the locations that a protein binds in a particular cell type using an experimental method called ChIP-seq, followed by computational interpretation of the data. However, since the experimental data are typically noisy, it is often difficult to compare the computational analyses of ChIP-seq data across multiple experiments in order to understand any differences in binding that may occur in different cell types. In this paper, we present a new computational method named MultiGPS for simultaneously analyzing multiple related ChIP-seq experiments in an integrated manner. By analyzing all the data together in an appropriate way, we can gain a more accurate picture of where the profiled protein is binding to the genome, and we can more easily and reliably detect differences in protein binding across cell types. We demonstrate the MultiGPS software using a new analysis of the regulatory protein Cdx2 in three different developmental cell types."

It thrives in the colon thanks to its ability to attach intimately to the intestinal epithelium. Here, we have identified and characterised a small antibody fragment (nanobody) that recognises Tir, a receptor injected by the bacterium into the host cell to mediate intimate attachment. This nanobody shows higher affinity against Tir than its natural bacterial ligand (intimin) and, most importantly, blocks the intimate attachment of the pathogen to the human colonic tissue. Our results show the potential of this nanobody to prevent and treat EHEC infection."

In flowering plants, the switch from outbreeding to inbreeding has occurred repeatedly, yet little is known about the underlying genetic events. This is true even for the model species A. thaliana, a highly self-fertile member of the crucifer family. In this family, outbreeding is enforced by a self-incompatibility system controlled by the S locus, which involves the recognition of pollen by the stigma to prevent self-fertilization and familial inbreeding. We recently demonstrated that A. thaliana accessions may be reverted to full or partial self-incompatibility by transformation with S-locus genes isolated from its close self-incompatible relative A. lyrata. Despite much recent debate, however, we still do not know how A. thaliana became self-fertile. Here, we use our recently established A. thaliana transgenic self-incompatible experimental model to address these issues. Analysis of the S locus in accessions that can be reverted to full self-incompatibility demonstrates that self-fertility in A. thaliana arose by at least two independent S-locus mutations. Furthermore, analysis of an accession that expresses only partial self-incompatibility shows that self-fertility is associated with an unstable allele at a locus unlinked to the S locus."

Recently there have been reports of increased risk for amebiasis among men who have sex with men (MSM) due to oral-anal sexual contact in several developed countries. In this longitudinal follow-up study, the incidence of amebiasis was determined among HIV-infected patients using serological and specific amebic antigen assays. DNA extracted from stool samples containing E. histolytica were analyzed by PCR, sequenced, and compared. Clinical manifestations and treatment response of invasive amebiasis in HIV-infected patients were reviewed. The results demonstrated that HIV-infected MSM were at significantly higher risk of amebiasis than patients from other risk groups. Clustering of E. histolytica isolates by sequencing analyses from geographically unrelated patients suggested person-to-person transmission. Despite immunosuppression, amebic liver abscesses and colitis responded favorably to metronidazole therapy.

This model provides a single framework within which to interpret emerging results from evolutionary biology, human genetics, and cancer genetics. We show that the accrual of mutations should track cell divisions not only when mutations originate during DNA replication but also when they arise through non-replicative mechanisms and are repaired efficiently. This realization means that previous observations of correlations between mutation and cell division rates actually provide little support to the commonly held belief that most germline and somatic mutations arise from replication errors. We further find that only mutations that arise from inefficiently repaired lesions will accrue according to absolute time; thus, without covariation in life history traits, the phylogenetic “molecular clock” should not be expected to run at constant rates across species."

However, genetic loci that exhibit transmission ratio distortion (TRD) are sometimes observed in offspring of F1 hybrids. Meiotic drive is a type of non-Mendelian inheritance in which a “selfish” genetic element exploits asymmetric female meiotic cell division to promote its preferential inclusion in ova. We previously reported TRD on Chr 2 in the CC, a mouse recombinant inbred panel with contributions from three Mus musculus subspecies. Here we show that maternal TRD consistent with a novel meiotic drive system is caused by a copy number gain. This mutation is similar in size and structure to other known meiotic drive responders, such as the knobs of maize. A deletion of most of the copies is sufficient to restore Mendelian segregation, proving that the copy number variant is causative of the observed TRD. In the CC, and also the related DO population, the transmission frequency of the favored allele varies dependent on genetic background, demonstrating that this system is under genetic control. In conclusion, we describe a novel wild-derived meiotic drive locus on mouse Chr 2 that exploits female meiosis asymmetry to violate the Laws of Mendelian inheritance."

Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is a prion disease of small ruminants identified worldwide. Currently it represents a significant part of the TSE cases detected in Europe. The restricted tissue distribution of Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent in its natural host and the low detected prevalence of secondary cases in affected flocks meant that it is believed to be a poorly transmissible disease. This has led to the view that Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is a spontaneous disorder for which human and animal exposure risk remains low. In this study we demonstrate that in affected individuals, Atypical/Nor98 scrapie agent can disseminate in lymphoid tissues, nerves, and muscles, challenging the idea that it is a brain-restricted infectious agent. Evidence for the deficiencies in the current methods applied for monitoring Atypical/Nor98 scrapie is provided that would indicate an underestimation in the prevalence in the general population and in the affected flocks. These elements challenge the hypothesis on the biology of this recently identified TSE agent."

However, it is unclear whether human genes show similar dynamic range of expression between populations. In this work we analyzed HapMap gene expression compendium, and quantified the between-population and within-population expression variability for ∼18,000 human transcripts. We first concluded that the majority of the human genes have similar levels of within-population variability. However, a small fraction (∼4%) does show much higher expression variability in one population, and the deviation is consistently associated with increased SNP heterozygosity in their UTR regulatory regions. We further showed that genes with the greatest within-population expression variability are significantly enriched for chemokine signaling associated with HIV-1 infection. Combined with the finding that human HIV-1 host factors tend to have increased expression variability within populations, our analysis may explain, at least in part, different susceptibility to HIV infection within the human population. This work provides a fresh angle for analyzing gene expression variations in populations."

Here, we use the economic theory of contests to show that as fewer grants are funded, the value of the science that researchers forgo while preparing proposals can approach or exceed the value of the science that the funding program supports. As a result, much of the scientific impact of the funding program is squandered. Unfortunately, increased waste and reduced efficiency is inevitable in a grant proposal competition when the number of awards is small. How can scarce funds be allocated efficiently, then? As one alternative, we show that a partial lottery that selects proposals for funding randomly from among those that pass a qualifying standard can restore lost efficiency by reducing investigators' incentives to invest heavily in preparing proposals. Lotteries could also improve efficiency by compelling administrators to de-emphasize grant success as a primary measure of professional achievement. If lotteries are politically untenable, another remedy would be to fund researchers based on their previous research successes, although in such a way that avoids establishing barriers to entry for junior scientists or scientists from historically underrepresented demographic groups."

SIgA patrol the mucus and are usually known to help immune tolerance via entrapping dietary antigens and microorganisms and other mechanisms. SIgA, in complex with its antigens, can also be taken back up by the intestinal epithelium in a process known as reverse transcytosis. SIgA can thereby promote the uptake and delivery of antigens from the intestinal lumen to the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissues (GALT), influencing inflammatory responses. This reverse transcytosis of SIgA is mediated by specialized epithelial M cells. Because M cells possess the ability to take up antigens and are therefore important to the local immune system, they are a key target for the specific delivery of novel mucosal vaccines against various diseases. M cell receptors that take up the SIgA-antigen complexes, which serve as mucosal vaccine vehicles, represent an important aspect of this vaccine strategy. The identification of SIgA receptor(s) on the surface of M cells has, however, remained elusive for more than a decade. In this study, we now identify Dectin-1 and Siglec-5 as the key receptors for M cell–mediated reverse transcytosis of SIgA complexes. We further find that the glycosylation modification, and particularly sialylation, of SIgA is required for its uptake by M cells. We show that, when administered orally in complex with SIgA, the HIV p24 antigen is taken up in a strictly Dectin-1-dependent manner to stimulate a mucosal and systemic antibody response. These findings are considered important for understanding gut immunity."

Although contemporary -OMICs studies have uncovered various associations between metabolite levels and aging, in many cases the directionality of the relationships is unclear. In a recent metabolomics study, we found that glycine accumulates in aged C. elegans while other amino acids decrease. The present study shows that glycine supplementation increases lifespan and drives a genome-wide inhibition effect on C. elegans gene expression. Glycine as a one-carbon donor fuels the methyl pool of one-carbon metabolism composed of the folate and methionine cycles. We find that the glycine-mediated longevity effect is fully dependent on the methionine cycle, and that all of our observations are conserved with supplementation of the other one-carbon amino acid, serine. These results provide a novel role for glycine as a promoter of longevity and bring new insight into the role of one-carbon amino acids in the regulation of aging that may ultimately be beneficial for humans."

Choice of which assays to use in the laboratory is generally done considering reproducibility, robustness, expertise and affordability in a given setting. As evidenced in this study, most laboratories in Africa lack resources especially finances, equipments and expertise to perform necessary tests for diagnosis and identification of specific pathogens. The study shows that the differentiation of species can be correctly concluded from the analysis with AMOS, Bruce-ladder and MLVA16 assays. Furthermore, MLVA16 can be used as an epidemiological tool and traceback of outbreaks.

In normal cells, RNA splicing is a tightly controlled process that leads to production of a well-defined set of mRNAs. Cancer cells, however, often produce aberrant, mis-spliced mRNAs. Such disorders have not been quantified to date. To this end, we use a well-known measure of disorder called Shannon's entropy. We show that overall splicing disorders are highly significant in many cancers, and that the extent of disorder may be correlated to the level of cell proliferation in each tumor. Surprisingly, genes that control the splicing mechanism are unusually frequent among genes affected by splicing disorders. This suggests that cancer cells may withstand harmful chain reactions in which splicing defects in key regulatory genes would in turn cause extensive splicing damage. As mis-spliced mRNAs are widely studied for cancer diagnosis, awareness of these global disorders is important to distinguish reliable cancer markers from background noise."

Mammals and poxviruses encode homologous inhibitory proteins of IL18, named IL18BPs, which regulate IL18 activity and, in the case of the viral proteins, contribute to virulence. Previous structural and functional studies revealed residues at IL18:IL18BP interface that are critical for the high-affinity binding, including a phenylalanine on IL18BPs, which is conserved among nearly all IL18BPs with the notable exception of yatapoxvirus IL18BPs. To understand the mechanism by which yatapoxvirus IL18BPs neutralize IL18, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of the Yaba-Like Disease Virus (YLDV) IL18BP:IL18 complex. The structure revealed a 2∶2 bivalent binding complex, which has not been observed in any other IL18BPs. Through mutagenesis and functional studies, we found a set of interacting residues that are unique for the association of YLDV-IL18BP and IL18, likely compensating for the lack of the interactions involving the conserved phenylalanine. Despite this extensive divergence, however, YLDV-IL18BP binds to the same surface of IL18 used by other IL18BPs. Our study suggests that all IL18BPs use a conserved inhibitory mechanism by blocking a putative receptor-binding site on IL18 but the interface on IL18 is malleable by a broad and diverse family of mammalian and poxvirus IL18BPs."

Attempts to quantify such between-strain variation are lacking in high prevalence settings. We analysed data from concurrent outbreaks with different MRSA strains in two adult intensive care units. MRSA is usually carried by patients asymptomatically, and most of our data came from routine screening swabs used to detect such carriage. We divided strains into two groups: common United Kingdom strains and strains from a type often found in Southeast Asia. We developed a new method to estimate how transmission changes over time and compared results with those from an adaptation of a previously described approach. An advantage of the new method is that it makes weaker assumptions about the process generating the data. The methods gave broadly similar results: the introduction of daily antiseptic bodywashes for all patients was the only intervention associated with a substantial fall in transmission, but this intervention was less effective for the Asian strain. This work should be useful for assessing the between-strain variation in the transmission of other hospital pathogens, and for assessing the impact of interventions on patient-to-patient transmission."

However, previous studies suggest that HIV impairs YF vaccine response. In this study, we assessed if HIV infection impacts the risk of adverse events and could reduce antibody response to YF vaccine. We explored if laboratory markers of persistent inflammation, frequently present among HIV-infected patients, could predict antibody response to YF vaccine in this population. We found that HIV had no significant effect on adverse events or levels of antibodies through 3 months after vaccination, but this may be limited by the small sample size of 12 HIV-infected and 45-uninfected participants in the study. However, we were able to show that, compared to HIV-uninfected participants, HIV–infected patients had lower antibody titers 1 year following YF vaccine even after statistical adjustment for the potential effects of sex, age and prior vaccination. Persistent inflammation seems to reduce YF vaccine antibody response in HIV-infected participants. In conclusion, HIV-infected individuals have impaired antibody response to YFV due to a poorer persistence of antibodies, despite a seemingly normal initial response. HIV-infected patients at permanent or recurring risk of YF infection may benefit from a booster dose of YF vaccine."

One of the most well-known examples of virus-based nanotools developed so far features viral capsules as therapeutic agents, which protect and deliver drug molecules to targeted disease sites in the human body before the drug molecules are released. In order to optimize these nano-designs to best fulfill their purposes, we first have to understand properties of the constitutive building blocks of these viral containers, so as to rationalize and guide the synthetic modification attempts. Based on the observation that viral shells are functionally unique to viruses, we hypothesize that the structure of the building blocks must also be distinct from generic proteins, given that function follows form. Our computational modeling and statistical analysis support this novel hypothesis, and recognize the folded topology of these ‘Lego’ proteins as a differentiating factor to ensure correct geometry, and consequently, proper tiling into the large complex architecture. Our findings highlight an important design principle: efforts on imparting new functionalities to virus templates should restrain from disrupting the fundamental protein fold."

Prion diseases are by definition transmissible, which means that it should be possible to experimentally transfer disease from patient brain tissue to laboratory animals by inoculation. While many forms of prion disease have been shown to be experimentally transmissible, some inherited forms, in particular, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) associated with the substitution of valine for alanine at amino acid position 117 (GSS A117V) of the human prion protein gene have not. This has led to the suggestion that such syndromes are not true prion diseases and are better designated non-transmissible proteinopathies. Since prions may transmit more efficiently when the host's normal prion protein amino acid sequence matches that of the infecting prion, we generated transgenic mice expressing human prion protein with the same amino acid sequence found in A117V GSS. We found that brain tissue from GSS A117V patients could transmit disease to these mice, producing the typical brain lesions associated with GSS A117V. We therefore conclude that GSS A117V is an authentic prion disease."

The recent advent of drugs that offer large genetic barriers to resistance, e.g., tipranavir and darunavir, presents a new opportunity to devise therapies that remain efficacious over extended durations. The large number of mutations that HIV must accumulate for resistance to drugs with large genetic barriers impedes the failure of therapy. Further, these drugs appear to exhibit activity against viral strains resistant to other drugs in the same drug class, thereby significantly improving options for therapy. Rational identification of treatment protocols that maximize the impact of these new drugs requires a quantitative understanding of the process whereby HIV overcomes large genetic barriers to resistance. We develop a model that describes HIV dynamics under the influence of a drug that offers a large genetic barrier to resistance and predict the time of emergence of viral strains that overcome the large barrier. Model predictions provide insights into the roles of various evolutionary forces underlying the development of resistance, quantitatively describe the development of resistance to tipranavir in vitro, and suggest guidelines for drug design."

During this period they have evolved many pathways for besting the competition; one of the most recent of these to be described is the type VI secretion system (T6SS). The T6SS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a complex machine that the bacterium uses to intoxicate neighboring cells. Among the toxins this system delivers is type VI secretion exported 2 (Tse2). In addition to acting on competing organisms, this toxin can act on P. aeruginosa; thus, the organism synthesizes a protein, type VI secretion immunity 2 (Tsi2), which neutralizes the toxin. In this paper we dissect the function and structure of Tsi2. We show that although Tsi2 interacts with and stabilizes Tse2 inside the bacterium, the toxin does not require the immunity protein to reach the secretion apparatus. Our structure of Tsi2 shows that the protein adopts a dimeric configuration; however, we find that its dimerization is not required for Tse2 interaction. Instead, our findings indicate that Tse2 interacts with an acidic surface of Tsi2 that is opposite the homodimer interface. Our results provide key molecular insights into the process of T6 toxin secretion and immunity."

Furthermore , functional similarities phylogenetically unrelated prokaryotic systems indicate syntenic zinc acquisition loci independently selected evolution .","The capacity of disease-causing microbes to acquire nutrients from their host is one of the most fundamental aspects of infection. Host organisms therefore restrict microbial access to certain key nutrients in a process known as nutritional immunity. Recently, it was found that infected vertebrates sequester zinc from invading microorganisms to control infection. Therefore, the mechanisms of microbial zinc acquisition represent potential virulence attributes. Here we report the molecular mechanism of host-derived zinc acquisition by the major human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. We show that C. albicans utilises a secreted protein, the pH-regulated antigen 1 (Pra1), to bind zinc from its environment. Pra1 then reassociates with the fungal cell via a syntenically encoded (genetically-linked) membrane transporter (Zrt1) to acquire this essential metal. Deletion of PRA1 prevented utilisation of host zinc and damage of host cells in the absence of exogenous zinc. Finally, we demonstrate that this zinc-scavenging locus arose in an ancient fungal lineage and remains conserved in many contemporary species. Syntenically arranged zinc acquisition systems have evolved independently in the fungal and bacterial kingdoms, suggesting that such an arrangement is evolutionary beneficial for microorganisms."

C. trachomatis is the most commonly encountered sexually transmitted pathogen, as well as the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. The prevalence of chlamydial infections, and the extraordinary morbidity and health care costs associated with chronic persisting disease, justifies the research efforts in this area of microbial pathogenesis. Despite their clinical importance, the mechanisms by which these intracellular bacteria obtain nutrients essential to their growth remain enigmatic. Acquisition of sphingolipids, from the cells that chlamydiae infect, is essential for bacterial propagation. This study identifies a requirement for the lipid sphingomyelin from the infected host cell for bacterial replication during infection, and for long-term subsistence in persistent chlamydial infection. Blockage of sphingomyelin acquisition results in premature release of bacteria, a reduced bacterial number, and failure of the bacteria to cause a persisting infection. In this study, we have identified and subsequently disrupted specific sphingomyelin transport pathways, providing important implications on therapeutic intervention targeting this successful microbial pathogen."

Despite the urgent global need, no specific treatments are available for norovirus induced gastroenteritis, partly because innate immune responses upon gastrointestinal norovirus infection are largely unresolved. Using the murine norovirus (MNV) model we showed that MNV infection in macrophages leads to a lytic form of cell death termed pyroptosis as well as to the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Maturation of IL-1β was observed also in vivo, after gastrointestinal infection of MNV-susceptible Stat1 knockout mice. We found that these innate immune responses upon MNV infection crucially depended on activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome leading to Gasdermin D-driven pyroptosis, and inactivating this signaling pathway delayed lethality of MNV-susceptible STAT1 knockout mice after gastrointestinal MNV infection. We thus identified Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and ensuing pyroptosis as a signaling pathway contributing to norovirus-induced immunopathology. Taken together, this study resulted in a more detailed understanding of MNV-induced inflammatory and cell death pathways and provided insights into how gastrointestinal viruses induce immunopathology."

In this work, we employed computational strategies to disclose the human TAAR6 and TAAR8 receptors as sensors of the putrescine and cadaverine molecules.

Previous classification studies have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to differentiate between healthy controls and neurological or psychiatric patients. However, these studies are typically based on descriptive patterns and indirect measures of neural activity, and they rarely afford mechanistic insights into the underlying condition. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a classification approach that rests on a model of brain function and exploits the rich discriminative information encoded in directed interregional connection strengths. Based on an fMRI dataset acquired from moderately aphasic patients and healthy controls, we illustrate that our approach enables more accurate classification and deeper mechanistic insights about disease processes than conventional classification methods."

It is impossible to distinguish patients with true GAS pharyngitis infections from GAS carriers with pharyngitis caused by viral infections when throat swab culturing alone is used to diagnose GAS pharyngitis. Carriers are not likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment, but may receive treatment unnecessarily. Reported rates of GAS pharyngitis and carriage vary considerably depending on the setting. Thus it is difficult to ascertain which groups are likely to benefit significantly from active sore throat management programmes which treat GAS pharyngitis in order to prevent ARF. We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis and asymptomatic carriage in different settings. Approximately 10% of all children swabbed for a sore throat in clinical settings have true GAS pharyngitis, but this increases to around 55% if the children have GAS detected in their throat using swab cultures. In active sore throat management programmes, the prevalence of GAS detection is lower than in clinical settings and if it declines towards 8% (the asymptomatic carriage level), there may be little benefit in treating GAS culture-positive patients with antibiotics."

Herpesviruses include several important human pathogens, such as herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type 1 and 2 (causing cold sores and genital herpes, respectively), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV; the most common viral cause of congenital defects, and responsible for serious disease in immuno-compromised individuals), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; associated with infectious mononucleosis and a wide range of malignancies). Current antiviral drug treatments are not effective in clearing herpesviruses from infected individuals. Therefore, there is a need for alternative strategies to combat these pathogenic viruses and prevent or cure herpesvirus-associated diseases. Here, we have assessed whether a direct attack of herpesvirus genomes within virus-infected cells can inactivate these viruses. For this, we have made use of the recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 genome-engineering system to target and alter specific regions within the genome of these viruses. By targeting sites in the genomes of three different herpesviruses (HSV-1, HCMV, and EBV), we show complete inhibition of viral replication and in some cases even eradication of the viral genomes from infected cells. The findings presented in this study open new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat pathogenic human herpesviruses using novel genome-engineering technologies."

Strategies to regenerate or replace these cells require a deeper understanding of the regulatory processes that underlie their generation during development. Here we show in a Sox10 overexpressing mouse model that increase of the levels of a single transcription factor during embryogenesis efficiently converts the already Sox10 expressing satellite glial cells of the peripheral nervous system into oligodendrocyte-like cells by a mechanism that does not simply recapitulate developmental oligodendrogenesis but involves direct Sox10-dependent induction of the oligodendroglial differentiation network. Our study identifies mechanisms that may help to convert other cell types into oligodendrocytes and thus prove eventually useful for therapies of myelin diseases.

The disease is most frequently transmitted by triatomine insects but can also be passed through blood donation or from mother to child at birth. Experts estimate that 8 million people are infected with Chagas disease globally and that 1.1 million of these infections are found in Mexico. Most public health programs for Chagas disease focus on preventing new infections through vector control and screening the blood supply. However, in recent years there has been a greater focus on treating the disease with one of two available medications, benznidazole or nifurtimox. This study explores access to these two drugs in Mexico. The study shows that less than 0.5% of those who are infected with the disease received treatment in Mexico in years. The study also identified important factors that limit access in Mexico, including the exclusion of both drugs from the national health insurance program and problems importing these medications. Finally, the paper suggests ways that these problems can be overcome in Mexico, while providing helpful insight for other countries that struggle with similar problems in treating this disease."

It is characterised by rapid rates of self-renewal and repair; dysregulation of these processes is thought to explain, in part, why many tumours form in the intestinal and similar epithelial tissues. These features have led to a large amount of work on estimating cell kinetic parameters in the intestine. There remain, however, large gaps between the raw data collected, the interpretation of these experimental data, and mechanistic models that describe the underlying processes. Hierarchical statistical modelling provides a natural method with which to bridge these gaps, but has, to date, been underutilised in the study of intestinal tissue self-renewal. As we illustrate, this approach makes essential use of the distinction between ‘measurement’, ‘process’ and ‘parameter’ models, giving an explicit framework for combining experimental data and mechanistic modelling in the presence of multiple sources of uncertainty. We apply this approach to analyse experiments on healthy, damaged and recovering intestinal tissue, finding that observed data can be explained by a model in which cell movement is driven primarily by proliferation."

WHO has recently recognized the problem, listed the liver flukes as neglected tropical diseases and recommends mass drug treatment of humans to overcome the diseases. Domestic animals including dogs, cats and pigs contribute to transmission and the infection must be controlled in these animals if the transmission cycle shall be broken. We studied the effect of a single praziquantel treatment in a group of natural infected dogs in an FZT endemic area in Northern Vietnam. The dogs were followed over 4 months after treatment and management practices were described. We found that dogs had easy access to raw fish and did not receive treatment against flukes by their owners. More than fifty per cent of the dogs became reinfected with FZT within 3 months after treatment. We conclude that repeated mass treatments are not applicable and cannot stand alone for control of FZT in dogs. The reinfection pattern in humans treated for FZT needs to be investigated to monitor effect of mass drug treatments and avoid development of drug resistance."

We discovered a rich repertoire of CAZymes, proteases, SMs and pathogenesis related genes. We also identified a gene cluster containing 20 genes involved in the leucinostatins A and B biosynthesis by gene deletion, qRT-PCR and RNA-seq analyses. A transcription factor in the pathway was overexpressed, resulting in the upregulation of the related genes and a 1.5-fold increase in leucinostatins A and B. A new bioactivity of leucinostatins, inhibition of the growth of the notorious Phytophthora, was identified in this study by confronting incubation with P. lilacinum. These results provided new strategies for the agricultural development of leucinostatins and improving P. lilacinum strains."

The extremely poor live largely in the tropics. This latitudinal gradient in income suggests that there are biophysical factors, such as the burden of disease, driving the effect. However, measuring the effects of disease on broad economic indicators is confounded by the fact that economic indicators simultaneously influence health. We get around this by using simultaneous equation modeling to estimate the relative effects of disease and income on each other while controlling for other factors. Our model indicates that vector-borne and parasitic diseases (VBPDs) have systematically affected economic development. Importantly, we show that the burden of VBPDs is, in turn, determined by underlying ecological conditions. In particular, the model predicts that the burden of disease will rise as biodiversity falls. The health benefits of biodiversity, therefore, potentially constitute an ecosystem service that can be quantified in terms of income generated."

These viruses enter and spread in and out of the mammalian nervous system, a defining hallmark of their lifecycle and potential pathogenesis. Neurons are polarized cells, and the movement of certain cellular proteins is highly restricted to the cell body, to dendrites, or to axons. Indeed, the axon harbors only a small subset of neuronal proteins. Thus, it is remarkable that these viruses efficiently gather and move their structural components from the cell body to the axon after infection of neurons. Previously, we identified a small viral membrane protein (known as Us9) that mediates the efficient targeting of virus particles to axons of infected neurons. We now report that Us9 must localize to “lipid raft” domains, specialized regions within cellular membranes to promote axonal targeting. Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts dramatically reduces sorting of structural proteins to axons. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to implicate lipid rafts in targeting alpha herpesvirus structural proteins to axons, an essential step for spread of infection in the mammalian nervous system."

However, only one-third of patients with depression benefit from the first antidepressant compound they are prescribed. It is a fundamental problem that the outcomes of individual antidepressant treatments are still highly unpredictable. In clinical studies, discovery of biomarkers for antidepressant response is hampered by confounding factors such as the heterogeneity of the disease phenotype and additional environmental factors, e.g., previous life events and different schedules of psychopharmacological treatment, which reduce the power to detect true response biomarkers. To overcome some of these limitations, we have established a conceptually novel approach that allows the selection of extreme phenotypes in an antidepressant-responsive mouse strain. In the first step, we identify signatures in the transcriptome of peripheral blood associated with responses following stratification into good and poor treatment responders. As proof of concept, we translate the murine data to a population of depressed patients. We show that differences in expression profiles from baseline to week 12 of the human orthologues predict response status in patients. We finally provide evidence that sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor could be a potential key mechanism shaping response to antidepressant treatment."

Achieving understanding interplay clock oscillations positional information crucial step investigation segmentation mechanism .","Vertebrate embryos acquire a segmented structure along the anteroposterior axis. Segmentation is critical for patterning of other structures (such as nerves, vertebrae, muscles, and blood vessels) and occurs by the rhythmic separation of balls of cells, called somites, from the anterior end of their precursor tissue, called the presomitic mesoderm. These rhythmic events are associated with oscillatory gene expression in the presomitic mesoderm: waves of gene expression originate at the posterior end and spread anteriorly. When a wave reaches the anterior end, a pair of new somites detaches. The set of genes whose expression oscillates is termed the “somitogenesis clock.” Even though the zebrafish somitogenesis clock has been the subject of intensive study, it is not clear how its oscillations are generated. It has been proposed that the mechanism involves a simple negative feedback loop, with proteins of the Her family periodically repressing their own expression. However, this is incompatible with some experimental results and does not explain how the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression is generated. Here I propose a model—based on physical interactions between Her proteins—that is compatible with experimental results, and that explains how positional information is used to generate the spatiotemporal pattern of gene expression."

By analyzing stage-specific expression profiles, we have identified enriched transcription factors responsible for lineage commitment and their corresponding regulatory modules. In addition, we reported a set of stable housekeeping genes more suitable for cross-sample normalization and calibration. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of a CAGE-based TSS dataset in developmental studies. Using the Brachyury gene as an example, we showed that CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing tools can be efficiently employed to target and transcriptionally activate the promoters of virtually any endogenous genes, enabled by the knowledge of their precise TSS locations.

Research on cryptosporidiosis in countries where it is endemic remains limited; few studies have comprehensively examined risk factors for children in Kenya and similar settings. We examined characteristics associated with Cryptosporidium in children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea in rural western Kenya. We found there is little to clinically distinguish cryptosporidiosis from other childhood diarrhea in the absence of point of care diagnostics. Infants had the highest odds of Cryptosporidium infection; it has been previously established that Cryptosporidium infections in infancy can have severe consequences. Prolonged/persistent duration diarrhea and growth shortfalls were significantly more pronounced among cases with Cryptosporidium. Undernutrition and stunting in children in low- and middle-income countries have predicted decreased cognitive and school performance, thus long-term consequences could be appreciable. Using rainwater as the primary drinking water source and boiling drinking water were protective against Cryptosporidium infection, thus certain water sources may contribute to transmission. Like other studies in Kenya, we predominantly identified Cryptosporidium hominis, an anthropogenic species. Advances in point of care detection, prevention and control approaches, effective water treatment technologies, and clinical management options are needed to mitigate the potentially severe and long-term consequences of Cryptosporidium infection in children."

Smoke from wildfires can cause health problems, especially for children, older persons, and people who already have respiratory or heart problems.Researchers had access to data on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits from California’s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. This allowed for analysis of the effects of wildfire among a particularly vulnerable population, which included a large proportion of young children. It also provided an opportunity to examine changes in outpatient visits.Researchers were able to look at health problems during the time when the wildfire smoke was most intense and also at later periods to see if people had health problems that may take more time to develop. They chose to study a very large wildfire that happened in San Diego County in 2007.During the peak fire period, emergency department visits for respiratory conditions increased by 34% and visits for asthma by 112%. There was no change in visits for heart-related problems.Some healthcare visit types remained high even after the peak fire period. For example, outpatient visits for acute bronchitis were 72% above the usual rate in the 5-day period following the peak fire period.Young children had bigger increases in visits during the peak fire period than older age groups. Children aged 0–4 had a 136% increase in emergency department visits for asthma, and very young children aged 0–1 experienced a 243% increase.Researchers studied how health visits changed on days with more intense smoke using data from smoke models. Emergency department visits for asthma went up 73% on days following an air quality day designated as “unhealthy for sensitive populations,” based on wildfire smoke and using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Air Quality Index (AQI) air pollution levels as a guide.We expect increases in respiratory problems during wildfires, possibly even at mildly degraded levels of air quality. People may continue to seek care for some persisting conditions.Young children appear at highest risk for respiratory problems during a wildfire, which is cause for particular concern because of the potential for long-term harm to children’s lung development.The risk of future wildfires on the health of Californians will continue to be shaped by global climate change, as well as the anticipated growth of vulnerable subpopulations. Planning to protect the health of vulnerable populations is important."

REAL McCOIL provides robust tool understanding molecular epidemiology malaria transmission settings .","Monitoring malaria epidemiology is critical for evaluating the impact of interventions and designing strategies for control and elimination. Population genetics has been used to inform malaria epidemiology, but it is limited by the fact that a fundamental metric needed for most analyses—the frequency of alleles in a population—is difficult to estimate from blood samples containing more than one genetically distinct parasite (polygenomic infections). A widely used approach has been to restrict analysis to monogenomic infections, which may represent a biased subset and potentially ignores a large amount of data. Therefore, we developed a new analytical approach that uses data from all infections to simultaneously estimate allele frequency and the number of distinct parasites within each infection. The method, called THE REAL McCOIL, was evaluated using simulations and was then applied to data from cross-sectional surveys performed in three regions of Uganda. Simulations demonstrated accurate performance, and analyses of samples from Uganda using THE REAL McCOIL revealed epidemiologically relevant differences within and between the three regions that previous methods could not. THE REAL McCOIL thus facilitates population genetic analysis when there are polygenomic infections, which are common in many malaria endemic areas."

The resulting stochastically generated expression heterogeneities have important biological consequences and also encode information about the underlying dynamics that generate them. A fundamental goal of transcriptional biology is to understand the quantitative regulation of gene-expression dynamics, which in eukaryotes depends on factors specific to each gene in concert with its surrounding cellular and genomic environment. We investigated the regulatory effects of variable genomic environments by quantitatively measuring expression heterogeneity from diverse single genomic integrations of the HIV promoter in cultured cells. Systematically fitting a model of stochastic gene expression to our measurements reveals transcript production in bursts as the underlying dynamic that accounts for the large heterogeneities observed within single-integration clonal cell populations, with the size of transcriptional bursts as the primary feature that varies over genomic integrations. Our findings implicate genomic environment as an important quantitative control parameter that eukaryotic cells might use to shape gene-expression patterns, and that lentviruses such as HIV, whose genomes are semi-randomly integrated into the genomes of the host cells they infect, may exploit to sample diverse and heterogeneous expression patterns that evade treatment."

Protection against these infections is mediated by mucosal immune defenses including secreted IgA as well as by the competing intestinal microbiota. However, so far the relative importance of these two different defense mechanisms remains unclear. We addressed this question using the example of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) gut infections which can be spread in stool of infected patients over long periods of time. We used a mouse model to reveal that the intestinal microbiota and the adaptive immune system hold different but complementary functions in fighting NTS infections. A primary Salmonella infection disrupts the normal microbiota and elicits Salmonella-specific sIgA. sIgA prevents disease when the animal is infected with NTS for a second time. However, sIgA was dispensable for pathogen clearance from the gut. Instead, this was mediated by the microbiota. By re-establishing its normal density and composition, the microbiota was necessary and sufficient for terminating long-term fecal Salmonella excretion. This establishes a novel paradigm: The microbiota clears the pathogen from the gut lumen, while sIgA protects from disease upon re-infection with the same pathogen. This has implications for the evolutionary role of sIgA responses as well as for developing microbiota-based therapies for curing infected patients."

The HCMV genes US2, US3, US6 and US11 promote virus persistence by their ability to downregulate cell surface MHC. We developed ‘Plasma Membrane Profiling’ (PMP), an unbiased SILAC-based proteomics technique to ask whether MHC molecules are the only focus of these genes, or whether additional cellular immunoreceptors are also targeted. PMP compares the relative abundance of cell surface receptors between control and viral gene expressing cells. We found that whereas US3, US6 and US11 were remarkably MHC specific, US2 modulated expression of a wide variety of cell surface immunoreceptors. US2-mediated proteasomal degradation of integrin α-chains blocked integrin signaling and suppressed cell adhesion and migration. All US2 substrates were degraded via the cellular E3 ligase TRC8, and in a remarkable example of cooperativity between HCMV immune-evasins, UL141 requisitioned US2 to target the NK cell ligand CD112 for proteasomal degradation. HCMV US2 and UL141 are therefore modulators of multiple immune-related pathways and act as a multifunctional degradation hub that inhibits the migration, immune recognition and killing of HCMV-infected cells."

To understand the mechanisms enabling bimodality in a natural decision-making circuit, we examined HIV’s fate-selection circuit, the Tat circuit. This bimodal circuit is sufficient and necessary to generate a bet-hedging decision between 2 alternate HIV fates: active viral replication and long-lived dormancy (proviral latency). The dormant state, which is resistant to most antiviral drugs, is the primary clinical barrier to curing an HIV infection. While the canonical role of positive feedback is to amplify a signal, surprisingly, we find that the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) positive-feedback architecture is instead optimized to expand the regime of HIV expression bimodality. From an evolutionary perspective, the results suggest that positive-feedback circuits may have evolved to robustly generate bimodality in certain contexts, and, given the rapid evolution of HIV, the presence of a circuit optimized to robustly generate bimodal expression patterns appears to support the hypothesis that HIV’s active-versus-latent decision confers viral fitness."

In gene conversion (GC), both ends of the DSB share homology to an intact donor locus, and the break is repaired by copying the donor to create a small patch of new DNA synthesis. In break-induced replication (BIR), only one side of the DSB shares homology to a donor, and repair involves assembly of a recombination-dependent replication fork that copies sequences to the end of the template chromosome, yielding a nonreciprocal translocation. Both processes require that the DSB ends be resected by 5′ to 3′ exonucleases, involving several proteins or protein complexes, including Exo1 and Sgs1-Rmi1-Top3-Dna2. We report that ectopic BIR is inhibited independently by Sgs1 and Exo1 and that overexpression of Rad51 recombinase further improves BIR, while GC is largely unaffected. Surprisingly, when both Sgs1 and Exo1 are deleted, and resection is severely impaired, half of the cells acquire new telomeres rather than completing BIR or GC. New telomere addition appears to result from the lack of resection itself and from the fact that, without resection, the Mec1 (ATR) DNA damage checkpoint fails to inactivate the Pif1 helicase that discourages new telomere formation."

It has been suggested that molecular recognition employs a variety of mechanisms, ranging from induced fit to conformational selection. In many realistic systems, conformational selection and induced fit are not mutually exclusive. An analytical flux analysis has been developed to determine the contribution of each model, but it is extremely challenging to obtain the necessary kinetic parameters for this flux analysis through experimental techniques. In this work, we have developed an approach integrating Markov State Models, molecular dynamics simulations, and flux analysis to tackle this problem. Using this approach, we have quantified the recognition mechanism of the choline binding protein to be ∼90% conformational selection dominant in the experimental conditions. Our methodology provides a way to quantify the molecular recognition mechanisms that are extremely difficult to be directly accessed by experiments. This opens up numerous possibilities for in silico design to fine tune the recognition event either to increase the degree of conformational selection or induced fit, so that new properties could be created to accommodate the needs of protein engineering, drug development and beyond."

In this study, we determined the prevalence and diversity of Salmonella in a collection of African venomous snakes for the first time. We showed that the majority of venomous snakes (91%) in our study carry Salmonella, and used bacterial genomics to assign two thirds of isolates to the S. enterica subspecies enterica which is associated with human salmonellosis. We identified two evolutionary groups of S. enterica subspecies enterica that display distinct metabolic profiles with infection-relevant carbon sources. Our findings could have a broad significance because venomous snakes can move freely around human dwellings in tropical regions of the world such as Africa, and could potentially shed contaminated faecal matter onto surfaces and into water supplies."

The study of these conditions has been instrumental in the discovery of biological pathways involved in the regulation of epithelial tissue morphogenesis. In this report, through the delineation of the molecular basis of a novel form of autosomal recessive ectodermal dysplasia, we identified a new key player in ectodermal development. We detected a number of mutations in TSPEAR co-segregating with abnormal hair and tooth development in three families. TSPEAR encodes the thrombospondin-type laminin G domain and EAR repeats (TSPEAR) protein, whose function is poorly understood. TSPEAR was found to be strongly expressed in murine hair and tooth. Using a reporter assay, we showed that it regulates Notch activity. Accordingly, NOTCH1 expression was altered in patient skin, and NOTCH1, as well as many of its known targets, was down-regulated in TSPEAR deficient keratinocytes. Moreover, Tspear silencing in mouse hair follicle organ cultures was found to induce apoptosis in follicular epithelial cells, resulting in decreased hair bulb diameter. Collectively, these observations indicate that TSPEAR plays a critical, previously unrecognized role in human tooth and hair follicle morphogenesis through regulation of the Notch pathway. As such, these new data are likely to lead to further investigations aimed at characterizing the role of Notch signaling pathway in other forms of ectodermal dysplasias as well as acquired hair and tooth pathologies."

Consequently , role soil considered planning interventions aimed reduce burden leptospirosis communities .","Leptospirosis is a globally distributed zoonotic disease that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in urban slums. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with water, soil, or mud that has been contaminated with infected urine shed from chronically infected animals. Despite the critical role the environment plays in the epidemiology of the disease, the contribution of soil to the transmission cycle remains largely undescribed. Herein, we investigated the distribution of pathogenic Leptospira in soil samples from an endemic urban slum in Brazil. We found pathogenic Leptospira in nearly one-third of the soil samples, predominantly in low concentrations (<5×102 GEq/g). However, we observed considerable variation in the distribution and concentration of the pathogen at the fine spatial scale within the slum. Our results indicate that soil is likely an important additional environmental reservoir of pathogenic Leptospira in urban slums and prevention strategies should consider soil to help prevent the transmission of the disease in similar settings."

To address this question, we recorded a large population of ganglion cells, the retinal output, in a dense patch of salamander and guinea pig retinas while displaying a bar moving in complex motion. From previous studies, the naive expectation was that individual ganglion cells would spike when an object was moving on their receptive field center and that the entire population’s activity would resemble a “hill” that continuously tracked the object’s location. However, our analysis revealed that this picture did not hold. Instead, ganglion cells fired sparsely and coded for the bar trajectory even when it was far from their receptive field center. Nevertheless, we showed that the bar’s position could be reconstructed from retinal activity with an accuracy better than the spacing between photoreceptors, when using more than 100 cells. We also showed that the retinal code was highly redundant, over-representing the same information more than 6-fold. Yet, this unexpected representation allowed for precise object tracking using a simple decoder, as long as the temporal structure of the spike trains was accounted for."

Under starvation conditions, the C. elegans larvae will enter a special developmental stage called dauer larva. An insulin-like signaling pathway controls dauer formation as well as adult lifespan by inhibiting the activity of FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 that regulates expression of stress-resistant genes. Here we isolate a new gene called daf-31; this gene encodes a protein that regulates C. elegans larval development, metabolism and adult lifespan. This protein has been found in other species to be part of an enzyme that functions to modify other proteins. We show that overexpression of our newly discovered protein stimulates the transcriptional activity of DAF-16. Interestingly, abnormal regulation of human proteins similar to DAF-31 results in tumor formation. It is known that human FOXO proteins prevent tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is possible that abnormal DAF-31 activity may lead to tumor growth by reducing DAF-16 activity. Thus, the present study may not only contribute to understanding the role of a universal enzyme in controlling development, metabolism and lifespan in other organisms besides worms but may also shed light on the mechanisms of tumorigenesis in humans."

Envenomation by snakebite is a worldwide problem, and Brazil presents a high incidence of Bothrops bites. Bothrops venoms cause pathological alterations with prominent local effects, such as edema, blistering, hemorrhage, dermonecrosis and myonecrosis, usually followed by poor tissue regeneration and permanent sequelae. Bleeding, coagulopathy, cardiovascular shock and renal failure are typical systemic effects of these venoms. The clinical treatment for snakebite envenoming is intravenous administration of the specific antivenom. However, serotherapy does not efficiently protect against local tissue damage. Additional challenges faced by classical antivenom therapy include the wide antigenic variation of venoms across species and even within the same snake species and the frequent occurrence of adverse reactions that are associated with the administration of immunobiologicals. The development of new effective toxin inhibitors based on the structure of natural antiophidic proteins is an attractive therapeutic alternative. DM64 is a myotoxin inhibitor that was isolated from opossum serum, and its expression as a recombinant protein is paramount to the characterization of its structure-function relationship, an essential step toward the development of alternative strategies to better manage bothropic snakebite envenomations."

The initial signal of a change in conditions rapidly passes through these networks from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it can lead to long-term alterations in cellular behavior by controlling the expression of genes. These cascades of signaling events underlie many normal biological processes. As a result, being able to map out how these networks change in disease can provide critical insights for new approaches to treatment. We present a computational method for reconstructing these networks by finding links between the rapid short-term changes in proteins and the longer-term changes in gene regulation. This method brings together systematic measurements of protein signaling, genome organization and transcription in the context of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. When used to analyze datasets from an oncogene expressing cell line model of human glioblastoma, our approach identifies key nodes that affect cell survival and functional transcriptional regulators."

Large-scale genomewide comparative studies that seek to link specific methylation patterns to disease will require hundreds or thousands of samples, and thus economical methods that assay genomewide methylation. One such method is MethylSeq, which samples cytosine methylation at site-specific resolution by high-throughput sequencing of the ends of DNA fragments generated by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. MethylSeq's low cost and simplicity of implementation enable its use in large-scale comparative studies, but biases inherent to the method inhibit interpretation of the data it produces. Here we present MetMap, a statistical framework that first accounts for the biases in MethylSeq data and then generates an analysis of the data that is suitable for use in comparative studies. We show that MethylSeq and MetMap can be used together to determine methylation profiles across the genome, and to identify novel unmethylated regions that are likely to be involved in gene regulation. The ability to conduct comparative studies of sufficient scale at a reasonable cost promises to reveal new insights into the relationship between cytosine methylation and phenotype."

To elucidate generative mechanisms of these fluctuations, theoretical studies try to reproduce their empirical properties by simulations using dynamic models of large-scale spontaneous brain activity. However, evaluations of the reproducibility have not been extended so far to the fluctuations in global network topology of coactivation patterns, recently shown to be related to human cognition and behavior. Here we examine the extent to which a stationary model typically used for simulating resting-state activity can reproduce spatial and temporal patterns of the empirically observed fluctuations in global network topology. We found that such a model successfully reproduced the magnitude of empirical fluctuations as well as their temporal dynamics, whereas their spatial patterning was not fully accounted for by the simulation. Our results suggest that stationary models can explain many empirical properties in the fluctuations in global network topology, while modeling of non-stationary dynamics and/or greater estimation accuracy of anatomical connections underlying the simulation would be required for complete replication. This finding provides new insights into how fluctuations in global network topology of coactivation patterns emerge in the human brain."

Here we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study the role of the TDP-43 orthologue tdp-1 in aging and neurodegeneration. In this study we discovered that tdp-1 is a stress-responsive gene acting within the Insulin/IGF signaling pathway to regulate lifespan and the response to oxidative stress. We found that, although worms missing tdp-1 were stress-sensitive, elevated expression of tdp-1 was toxic. We asked if tdp-1 also responded to the stress caused by toxic proteins found in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Using worm models for ALS, we discovered that mutant TDP-43 generated oxidative stress and induced tdp-1 expression with negative consequences on neuronal function and lifespan. Consistently, removing tdp-1 rescued toxicity in our worm ALS models. tdp-1's role in the cellular stress response likely reflects an ancient adaptation to deal with unfavorable environmental conditions that is inappropriately activated and maintained by genetic mutations leading to proteotoxic and oxidative stress. We predict that similar mechanisms may exist in humans, helping explain the involvement of TDP-43 in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders."

We constructed a novel screening system to find new regulators of insulin production in this critical cell type.

In this study, we examine a longevity-promoting transcriptional circuit composed of two ETS TFs, Pnt and Aop, and Foxo, a forkhead TF with evolutionarily-conserved pro-longevity functions. This leads us to demonstrate that the activity of the majority of ETS TFs in multiple tissues and even different animal taxa regulates lifespan, indicating that roles in ageing are a general feature of this family of transcriptional regulators."

Here we used a fluorescence imaging assay to detect the moment of scission in living cells and used this as a reference point from which to measure the characteristic recruitment signatures of 34 fluorescently tagged endocytic proteins. Pair-wise comparison of these recruitment signatures allowed us to identify seven modules of proteins that were recruited with similar kinetics. For the most part the recruitment signatures were consistent with what was previously known about the proteins' structure and their binding affinities; however, the recruitment signatures for some components (such as some BAR and F-BAR domain proteins) could not have been predicted from existing structural or biochemical data. This study provides a paradigm for mapping molecular dynamics in living cells and provides new insights into the mechanism of clathrin-mediated endocytosis."

For genes whose expression levels must be tightly controlled, enhancer activities must be tightly regulated. In this work, we show that enhancers that control the expression of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in Drosophila are regulated by a negative autoregulatory feedback mechanism. Negative autoregulation can be triggered by less than a two-fold increase in Ubx levels or by varying the genetic background. Together, these data reveal that enhancer activities are not always hardwired, but instead may be sensitive to genetic and environmental variation and, in some cases, to the amount of gene product they regulate. The finding that enhancers are sensitive to genetic background suggests that the regulation of gene expression is more plastic than previously thought and has important implications for how transcription is controlled in vivo."

Here we demonstrate the presence of the reproductive-specific protein Boule throughout bilaterally-symmetric animals (Bilateria) and the conservation of its male reproductive function in mice. Examination of Boule evolution in insect and mammalian lineages, representing the Protostome and Deuterostome clades of bilateral animals, failed to detect any evidence for accelerated evolution. Instead, purifying selection is the major force behind Boule evolution. Further investigation of Boule homologs among Deuterostome species revealed reproduction-specific expression, with a strong prevalence of testis-biased expression. We further determined the function of a deuterostomian Boule homolog by inactivating Boule in mice (a representative mammal, a class of Deuterostomes). Like its counterpart in Drosophila (a representative of the opposing Protostome clade), mouse Boule is also required only for male reproduction. Loss of mouse Boule prevents sperm production, resulting in a global arrest of spermatogenesis in remarkable similarity to that of Drosophila boule mutants. Our findings are consistent with a common origin for male gametogenesis among metazoans and reveal the high conservation of a reproduction-specific protein among bilaterian animals."

We have generated fish that have the characteristic behavioral and histological features of human myotubular myopathy.

We subsequently identified similar changes in muscle from patients with myotubular myopathy, corroborating the importance of our zebrafish findings. Because a functional tubulo-reticular complex is required for normal muscle contraction, we speculate that the weakness observed in myotubular myopathy is caused by breakdown of this network. In all, our study is the first to identify a potential pathomechanism to explain the clinical features of myotubular myopathy.

In eukaryotes, the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) is a central regulator of both global and mRNA-specific translation. PABP simultaneously interacts with the 3′ poly(A) tail of the mRNA and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G). These interactions circularize the mRNA and stimulate translation. PABP also regulates specific mRNAs by promoting miRNA-dependent deadenylation and translational repression. A key step in understanding PABP's functions is to identify factors that affect its association with the poly(A) tail. Here we show that the cytoplasmic isoform of the mouse heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (hnRNP-Q2/SYNCRIP), which exhibits binding preference to poly(A), interacts with the poly(A) tail by default when PABP binding is inhibited. In addition, hnRNP-Q2 competes with PABP for binding to the poly(A) tail. Depleting hnRNP-Q2 stimulates translation in cell-free extracts and in cultured cells, in agreement with its function as translational repressor. In addition, hnRNP-Q2 impeded miRNA-mediated deadenylation and repression of target mRNAs, which requires PABP. Thus, competition from hnRNP-Q2 provides a novel mechanism by which multiple functions of PABP are regulated. This regulation could play important roles in various biological processes, such as development, viral infection, and human disease."

Engineered as a system for early detection and daily monitoring of the intensity of seasonal influenza epidemics, Google Flu Trends uses internet search data and a proprietary algorithm to provide a surrogate measure of influenza-like illness in the population. During its first season of operation, the novel A/H1N1-pdm influenza virus emerged, heterogeneously causing sporadic outbreaks in the spring and summer of 2009 across many parts of the United States. During the autumn 2009 pandemic wave, Google updated their model with a new algorithm and case definition; the updated model has run prospectively since. Our study asks whether Google Flu Trends provides accurate detection and monitoring of influenza at the national, regional and local geographic scales. Reliable local surveillance is important to reduce uncertainty and improve situational awareness during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. We found substantial flaws with the original and updated Google Flu Trends models, including missing the emergence of the 2009 pandemic and overestimating the 2012/2013 influenza season epidemic. Our work supports the development of local near-real time computerized syndromic surveillance systems, and collaborative regional, national and international networks."

The finding that frataxin protein physically associates with scaffold proteins Isu1/IscU places it squarely in the pathway of Fe-S cluster assembly. Fe-S clusters are essential cofactors for many proteins involved in cellular respiration, DNA repair, translation and other processes. Frataxin is conserved throughout evolution, being present in eukaryotes such as yeast and human and in some prokaryotes including E. coli. However, differences exist between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic forms of frataxin. The eukaryotic forms are critical for Fe-S cluster assembly whereas prokaryotic forms are more dispensable. We found that a key to this difference is a single amino acid in the scaffold protein Isu1 at position 141. Changes of the eukaryotic amino acid, Met, to prokaryotic amino acids, Ile, Leu, Cys, or Val, rendered mitochondria more frataxin-independent. No other changes were able to replicate this effect. Thus, Isu1 containing Met at position 141 may have coevolved with frataxin in eukaryotes, conferring frataxin-dependence. In contrast, the appearance of other amino acids at this position may have rendered prokaryotic cells less dependent on frataxin."

However, experimental observations have shown that the muscle activation wave does not simply match the bending wave. Researchers have previously computed the torque required for muscles along the body based on classic hydrodynamic theories and explained the higher wave speed of the muscle activation compared to the curvature wave. However, the origins of other features of the muscle activation pattern and their variation among different species are still obscure after decades of research. In this study, we use 3D computational fluid dynamics models to compute the spatiotemporal distributions of both the torque and power required for eel-like and mackerel-like swimming. By examining both the torque and power patterns and considering the energy transfer, storage, and release by tendons and body viscoelasticity, we can explain not only the features and variations in the muscle activation patterns as observed from fish experiments but also how tendons and body elasticity save energy. We provide a mechanical picture in which the body shape, body movement, muscles, tendons, and body elasticity of a mackerel (or similar) orchestrate to make swimming efficient."

Several studies indicated this latent viral protein drove cellular invasion and metastasis. For this study, enforced LMP2A expressing NPC cell lines were generated. We show here that LMP2A induces an Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition and increases the Stem-like Cancer Cells in NPC. Our results suggest that LMP2A supports tumor initiation and recurrence of the infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. For the first time we report a virus protein that functions in the initiation and progression of cancer by inducing the cancer stem-like cells.

Caenorhabditis elegans lacks adaptive immunity and is therefore particularly dependent on mounting an innate immune response against pathogens. A major component of this response is the conserved PMK-1/p38 MAPK signaling cascade, the activation of which results in phosphorylation of the bZIP transcription factor ATF-7. Signaling via PMK-1 and ATF-7 causes broad transcriptional changes including the induction of many genes that are predicted to have antimicrobial activity including C-type lectins and lysozymes. In this study, we show that ATF-7 directly regulates the majority of innate immune response genes upon pathogen infection of C. elegans, and demonstrate that many ATF-7 targets function to promote pathogen resistance."

In zebrafish, smyd4 is ubiquitously expressed in early embryos and becomes enriched in the developing heart at 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf). We generated a smyd4 mutant zebrafish line (smyd4L544Efs*1) using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The maternal and zygotic smyd4L544Efs*1 mutants demonstrated a strong defect in cardiomyocyte proliferation, which led to a severe cardiac malformation, including left-right looping defects and hypoplastic ventricles. More importantly, two rare genetic variants of SMYD4 were enriched in a 208-patient cohort with congenital heart defects. Both biochemical and functional analyses indicated that SMYD4(G345D) was highly pathogenic. Using mass spectrometric analysis, SMYD4 was shown to specifically interact with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) via its MYND domain. Altered di- and tri-methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and acetylation of histone 3 in smyd4L544Efs*1 mutants suggested that smyd4 plays an important role in epigenetic regulation. Transcriptome and pathway analyses demonstrated that the expression levels of 3,856 genes were significantly altered, which included cardiac contractile genes, key signaling pathways in cardiac development, the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated protein processing pathway, and several important metabolic pathways. Taken together, our data suggests that smyd4 is a key epigenetic regulator of cardiac development."

The unique biology of these organisms has led to the need for different drug therapies to be developed for each. Identification of enzymatic targets that could be used to develop a single drug capable of treating multiple parasites would be revolutionary. Herein we show that the trypanosomatid biosynthetic pathway used to synthesize key precursors for DNA biosynthesis is unexpectedly vulnerable. We find that seemingly redundant enzymes thymidine kinase and cytidine deaminase are required, not for their typical role in salvaging exogenous precursors, but are instead essential for de novo synthesis of thymine nucleotides. Trypanosomatids lack alternative routes to synthesize these nucleotides, which are found in other eukaryotic cells, while encoding a previously unknown activity that degrades them. For these reasons thymidine kinase is essential to support infection in mice and has strong potential as a new drug target. While our work focused on the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, the impact of our findings may extend to other pathogenic trypanosomatids and potentially to additional single-celled eukaryotic human pathogens."

However, little is known about how the number of larval instars is fixed in each species or modified by the environment. The silkworm, Bombyx mori, provides a unique bioresource for investigating this question, as there are several “moltinism” strains that exhibit variations in the number of larval molts. The present study describes the first positional cloning of a moltinism gene. We performed genetic and biochemical analyses on the dimolting (mod) mutant, which shows precocious metamorphosis with fewer larval–larval molts. We found that mod is a juvenile hormone (JH)–deficient mutant that is unable to synthesize JH, a hormone that prevents precocious metamorphosis and allows the larvae to undergo multiple rounds of larval–larval molts. This JH–deficient mutation is the first described to date in any insect species and, therefore, the mod strain will serve as a useful model for elucidating the molecular mechanism of JH action. Remarkably, precocious larval–pupal transition in mod larvae does not occur in the first or second instar, suggesting that morphostatic action of JH is not necessary for young larvae of B. mori."

A molecular network involving feedback loops is responsible for the rhythm generation. A large number of clock-controlled genes pass on time messages and control several biological processes. In spite of its medical importance (role in cancer, sleep disorders, diabetes and others) the mechanism of action of the circadian clock and the role of its constituent's feedback loops remains partially unknown. Using a mathematical model, we were able to bring insight in open circadian biology questions. Firstly, increasing the mRNA degradation rate of Per can contribute to increase or decrease of the period which might explain contradictory experimental findings. Secondly, our data points to a more relevant role of the ROR/Bmal/REV-ERB loop. In particular, that this loop can be an oscillator on its own. We provide experimental evidence that overexpression of members of the ROR/Bmal/REV-ERB lead to loss of Bmal reporter mRNA oscillations. The fact that REV-ERB and ROR are nuclear receptors and therefore important regulators in many cellular processes might have important implications for molecular biology and medicine."

HCV p7 is produced by cleavage from the HCV polyprotein but also exists as an E2p7 precursor, of poorly defined properties. In this study, we have explored how the retarded cleavage between E2 glycoprotein and p7 viroporin could regulate their functions associated to virion assembly and/or perturbation of cellular membrane processes. Specifically, we demonstrate that p7 is able to regulate the cell secretory pathway, which induces the intracellular retention of HCV glycoproteins and favors assembly of HCV particles. Our study also identifies a novel assembly function located at p7 amino-terminus that is unmasked through E2p7-regulated processing and that controls the infectivity of different types of released viral particles.

To visualize the movements of these muscles and the deformations of the surrounding exoskeleton, we developed a technique to allow us to look inside the insects during tethered flight. We used a particle accelerator to record high-speed X-ray images of the flying blowflies, which we used to reconstruct three-dimensional tomograms of their flight motor at ten different stages of the wingbeat. We measured the asymmetric movements of the steering muscles associated with turning flight, together with the accompanying movements of the wing hinge—arguably the most complex joint in nature. The steering muscles represent <3% of total flight muscle mass, so a key question has been how they can modulate the output of the much larger power muscles. We show that by shifting the flight motor between different modes of oscillation, the fly is able to divert mechanical energy into a steering muscle that is specialized to absorb mechanical energy. In general, we find that deformations of the muscles and thorax are key to understanding this remarkable mechanism."

During DNA replication, two parallel signaling pathways play important roles in the maintenance of genome integrity. One pathway detects DNA damage, while the other senses replication stress. Both pathways activate responses that include arrest of cell cycle progression, giving cells time to cope with the problem. These pathways have been defined by treating cells with compounds that induce either replication stress or DNA damage, but little is known about their roles during unperturbed DNA replication. They may be important when several adjacent replication origins fail to initiate and forks from flanking origins must replicate longer regions of DNA than normal to complete replication. We have used a derivative of budding yeast chromosome III lacking all efficient replication origins to identify mutants that preferentially destabilize this chromosome fragment, which mimics a chromosome with a large inter-origin gap. We found that the DNA damage response pathway, but not the replication stress response pathway, plays an important role in maintaining this fragment. The signal recognized in this case may be replisome failure rather than forks stalled at endogenous DNA damage."

Cells possess a number of factors that can recognize aggregation-prone protein features and prevent aggregation. One common way this is achieved is through the pre-emptive degradation of aggregation-prone proteins. While considerable progress has been made in understanding how the amino acid sequence of a protein relates to intrinsic aggregation propensity, little is known about how aggregation-prone proteins avoid intracellular anti-aggregation systems. We used a genetic screen in yeast to define sequence features of aggregation-prone domains that lead to degradation or prion aggregation as it occurs in the context of eukaryotic protein quality control factors. Unexpectedly, we found that only a subset of aggregation-promoting amino acids could effectively stimulate degradation of an aggregation-prone domain. Furthermore, this degradation-promoting effect could be suppressed by classical prion domain features. Our results highlight the complex interplay between pre-emptive protein degradation and protein aggregation, and implicate the unusual composition of yeast prion domains in preventing their degradation."

The molecular cause is loss of activity of the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK), which phosphorylates fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, commiting glucose to glycolysis. Entry of fructose-6-phosphate into glycolysis is thus blocked, increasing glycogen synthesis and accumulation. Clinical manifestations of the disease are heterogeneous, ranging from exercise intolerance to early childhood death. To further understand the human pathology, we generated mice lacking muscle PFK. As in human patients, these mice showed severe exercise intolerance, hemolysis, and most died young. Lack of glycolysis in skeletal muscle also causes alterations in bioenergetics and compensatory changes in key metabolic genes. Additionally, although erythrocytes retained 50% of normal PFK activity, their overall functionality was impaired, aggravating the muscle dysfunction. Moreover, marked metabolic alterations in the heart lead to chronic hypertrophy, suggesting that cardiac pathology in GSDVII may be underestimated or misdiagnosed. This study indicates that this disease is more complex than a muscle glycogenosis and that symptoms other than those classically described should be taken into consideration. Finally, this animal model will enable us to develop new therapeutic approaches and better diagnostic tools."

Understanding the biophysical basis for protein patterning by deciphering the quantitative rules for their formation and motion is an important aspect of characterizing immune cell recognition and thence the rules for immune system activation. We propose a minimal mathematical model for the physical basis of dynamic membrane protein patterning in the IS, which encompass membrane mechanics, protein binding kinetics and motion, and fluid flow in the synaptic cleft. In particular we quantify the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins domains. We describe a phase diagram of possible protein patterns by two dimensionless parameters; a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein stiffness, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative to the protein binding rate. Direct comparison with experiment suggests that passive processes i.e. viscous fluid flow, elastic membrane bending and protein binding kinetics, can describe the short-time formation and transport of protein clusters, while active cytoskeletal processes enable long-time stabilization of the IS."

Controlled - Trials.comISRCTN31894035,"Leprosy is caused by a bacterium and is curable with a combination of antibiotics                    known as multi-drug therapy that patients take for six or 12 months. However a                    significant proportion of leprosy patients experience inflammation in their skin                    and/or nerves, which may occur even after successful completion of multi-drug                    therapy. These episodes of inflammation are called leprosy Type 1 reactions.                    Type 1 reactions are an important complication of leprosy because they may                    result in nerve damage that leads to disability and deformity. Type 1 reactions                    require treatment with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids. The                    optimum dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy remains unclear. We                    conducted a study to see if it would be safe to use a large dose of a                    corticosteroid called methylprednisolone for three days at the start of a 16                    week corticosteroid treatment regime of prednisolone in patients with leprosy                    Type 1 reactions and leprosy patients with nerve damage present for less than                    six months. We did this by comparing individuals who were given                    methylprednisolone followed by prednisolone and those who received just                    prednisolone. In this small study we did not see any significant difference in                    the frequency of adverse events due to corticosteroid treatment in the two                    groups. We did not demonstrate a significant difference in improvement in                    individuals in the methylprednisolone group (who received a larger dose of                    corticosteroids) than those in the prednisolone treated group. Overall                    approximately 50% of individuals required more prednisolone in addition                    to the 16 week course of treatment to prevent further nerve damage or reactions.                    This suggests that it would be worthwhile investigating longer treatment courses                    with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs."

SPOP gene was frequently altered by somatic point mutations in a distinct molecular subclass of prostate cancer, although the precise role that SPOP mutation plays in the development of prostate cancer is unclear. Mitochondria are highly motile organelles that undergo constant fission and fusion. Unbalanced mitochondrial fission and fusion events are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and frequently linked to human cancer. Here, we are the first to report that SPOP mutations are associated with dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics in prostate cancer and this finding may have potential clinical implications in prostate cancer treatment."

Using a set of marked VEEV clones and repeated sampling at various time points following C. taeniopus infection, we determined the number of clones in various mosquito tissues culminating in transmission. Bottlenecks were identified but the stage of occurrence was dependent on the dose that initiated infection. Understanding the points at which mosquito-borne viruses are constrained will shed light on the ways in which virus diversity varies, leading to selection of mutants that may result in host range changes or alterations in virulence."

MLVA genotyping confirmed role risk factors infection .","Q fever is a disease that could be transmitted from animals (cattle, sheep and goats) to humans and caused by a bacterium called Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii). Some human cases exhibiting characteristic clinical signs of that disease have been detected on Reunion Island, a tropical island in the Indian Ocean, but to date, we did not know if these animals could be seen as potential sources of the disease. Thus, a study was undertaken from March 2011 to August 2012 to detect the presence of that bacterium in these animals and to understand how they could get infected themselves. A total of 516 ruminants (245 cattle, 137 sheep and 134 goats) belonging to 71 farms and localized in different environments of the island were selected. Samples of blood, vaginal mucus and milk were concomitantly collected from females, and a questionnaire was submitted to the farmers. Ticks from positively detected farms were also collected. We observed 11.8% of cattle, 1.4% of sheep and 13.4% of goats had already been in contact with the bacterium. Coxiella burnetii was also directly detected in some vaginal and milk samples. None of the ticks were detected to be positive for C. burnetii. We found that the ruminants could be infected when their farm was exposed to prevailing winds because the bacterium can be transported by the wind, and when there were no specific precautions for visitors before entering the farm, because they could act as mechanical carriers of Coxiella. Conversely, keeping new animals under surveillance for some days to detect any signs of the disease before they enter the farm or keeping the animals in the barn at night limit the risk of infection."

Upon this skeleton of interactions, we calculate the weight of the interaction with the gene expression data captured over multiple time points using state-of-the-art analysis algorithms. Not surprisingly, this approach of combining prior knowledge into the analysis process significantly improves the performance of the analysis. This work is most significant as an example of how the wealth of textual data related to gene interactions can be incorporated into computational analysis, not solely to identify this type of pathway (a gene regulatory network) but for any type of similar biological problem."

Plasmid-borne resistance is widespread among bacterial pathogens. Plasmids generally entail a cost to the host, associated with the replication and maintenance of the genetic element and with the expression of its genes. Therefore, in the absence of antibiotic, both plasmids and resistance mutations are often deleterious and confer a fitness cost to the cell. Here we studied epistatic interactions between five natural conjugative plasmids and ten chromosomal mutations conferring resistance to three types of antibiotics, making a total of 50 different combinations of chromosomal mutations and conjugative plasmids. We show that sometimes plasmids confer an advantage to bacterial strains carrying resistance mutations in their chromosome. This occurs in 32% (16 out of 50) of tested combinations. Furthermore, in 5 out of 50 plasmid-mutations combinations studied (10%), we observed an increased fitness when a plasmid-bearing bacterial cell acquires a drug-resistant mutation. These examples of sign epistasis are highly unexpected. This work explains, at least in part, how multidrug resistance evolved so rapidly."

The L. donovani infectious cycle comprises two developmental stages, a motile promastigote stage that proliferates inside the digestive tract of the phlebotomine insect host, and a non-motile amastigote stage that differentiates inside the macrophages of mammalian hosts. Intracellular parasite survival in mouse and macrophage infection assays has been shown to be strongly compromised in the presence of the inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA), which binds to members of the cyclophilin (CyP) protein family. It has been suggested that the toxic effects of CsA on amastigotes occurs indirectly via host cyclophilins, which may be required for intracellular parasite development and growth. Using a host-free L. donovani culture system we revealed for the first time a direct and stage-specific effect of CsA on promastigote growth and amastigote viability. We provided evidence that parasite killing occurs through a heat sensitivity mechanism likely due to direct inhibition of the co-chaperone cyclophilin 40. Our data allow important new insights into the function of the Leishmania CyP protein family in differentiation, growth, and intracellular survival, and define this class of molecules as important drug targets."

The current view is that this occurs because a neuron needs to adapt its intrinsic electrophysiological properties either to maintain the same operative range in the presence of abnormal inputs or to compensate for the effects of pathological conditions. Limited experimental and modeling evidence suggests this might be implemented via the correlation and/or degeneracy in the function of multiple types of conductances. To study this mechanism in hippocampal CA1 neurons and interneurons, we systematically generated a set of morphologically and biophysically accurate models. We then analyzed the ensembles of peak conductance obtained for each model neuron. The results suggest that the set of conductances expressed in the various neuron types may be divided into two groups: one group is responsible for the major characteristics of the firing behavior in each population and the other is more involved with degeneracy. These models provide experimentally testable predictions on the combination and relative proportion of the different conductance types that should be present in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons."

We find that, while there is reasonable ability to predict the average effects of variation within the consensus recognition sequence of a transcriptional regulator, it is not possible to determine reliably the consequences of variation at any given genomic instance. This suggests that the interpretation of individual genome sequences will require comprehensive complementation with functional genomic studies."

Adult hookworms infect the small intestine, causing iron-deficiency anemia and other complications. Hookworms are among the most disabling parasites of the developing world. Drugs are useful for controlling hookworm disease. However, because people often get reinfected rapidly and parasites can develop drug resistance, a vaccine that provides long-term protection would improve control and help lead to eradication. At present, there is no licensed hookworm vaccine, and progress towards a vaccine has been limited. We identified a cysteine protease in the intestine of the human hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum that is among the most strongly expressed genes during blood feeding and that may help digest blood and be essential for hookworm survival. Vaccination of hamsters with this cysteine protease gave high levels of protection when antigen-specific antibodies in the blood were induced. These antigen-specific antibodies also made hookworms less mobile in culture. This cysteine protease is a promising candidate for further investigation as a human hookworm vaccine antigen."

More recently, by aCGH in conjunction with FISH confirmation of the aCGH findings, insertion events were demonstrated to occur much more frequently (1 in ~500 individuals tested). Although frequently detected, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of their formation. In this study, we identified 16 individuals with complex chromosomal insertions among 56,000 individuals tested at Baylor Genetics using clinical microarray analysis (CMA) and FISH. Custom high-density aCGH was performed on 10 individuals with available DNA, and breakpoint junctions were fine-mapped at nucleotide resolution by long-range PCR and DNA sequencing in 6 individuals to glean insights into potential mechanisms of formation. In addition, we analyzed 5 families with apparently balanced insertion in one parent detected by FISH analysis and found that 3 parents had additional small copy-number variants (CNVs) at one or both sides of the inserting fragments as well as at the inserted sites. We propose that replicative repair can result in interchromosomal complex insertions generated through chromothripsis-like chromoanasynthesis involving two or three chromosomes, and cause a significant fraction of apparently balanced insertions harboring small flanking CNVs."

The association may involve several species of bacteria within the same host. The sap-feeding insect called glassy-winged sharpshooter thus maintains a permanent metabolic association with two different species of bacteria that it hosts within specialised cells. Complete genome annotations of the two endocytobionts allowed to reconstruction of their metabolism. By manually inspecting those annotations and comparing them to reference metabolic functions, earlier studies revealed a great complementarity between the metabolisms of the two endocytobionts and indicated potential metabolic exchanges between them. However, the metabolism of an organism is complex enough that such an approach could only give a partial description of the metabolic exchanges in the symbiotic system. We therefore determined all the metabolic exchanges in the symbiotic system by a systematic and automatic exploration of the full metabolism of the two endocytobionts in order to detail those leading to the biosynthesis of compounds involved in the symbiotic function of each bacterium. Our results highly refine our knowledge about the complementarity and the connections between the metabolisms of the two bacteria and their host."

When virus-specific CD8+ T cells recognize these viral peptides they become activated, proliferate, and kill virus-infected cells to help rid the body of the virus. Two pathways have been described for the origin of the peptides presented by professional antigen presenting cells. In cross-presentation, the antigen presenting cells acquire the proteins from other cells which, in the case of a viral infection, must be infected. In direct presentation, the antigen presenting cells synthesize the proteins themselves and, therefore, during responses to viruses must be infected. However, the participation of direct presentation in anti-viral responses has never been deliberately demonstrated experimentally. In this paper we demonstrate that direct presentation occurs and is the main pathway to induce CD8+ T cells during infection with vaccinia virus. These findings provide important insights to our understanding of how one of the most effective anti-viral vaccines induces immunity and should contribute to the development of novel vaccines."

There was little evidence of quantifiable associations between vector indices and dengue transmission that could reliably be used to predict outbreaks. Furthermore, appropriately designed studies are required to elucidate the relationship between vector abundance and dengue transmission. Recommendations include: standardizing study designs, particularly with respect to spatial heterogeneity; vector surveillance programs should sample adult mosquitoes; global values of the Breteau Index are not reliable universal dengue transmission thresholds; and better knowledge of vector ecology is required."

A transcriptional regulatory system (TRS) connects a cell's environmental cues to its genome and in turn determines which genes are turned “on” in response to these cues. Consequently, TRSs control which proteins of an intracellular biochemical reaction network are present. These systems have been mathematically described, often through Boolean expressions that represent the activation or inhibition of gene transcription in response to various inputs. We recently developed a matrix formalism that extends these approaches and facilitates a quantitative representation of the Boolean logic underlying a TRS. We demonstrated on small-scale TRSs that this matrix representation is advantageous in that it facilitates the calculation of unique properties of a given TRS. Here we apply this matrix formalism to the genome-scale Escherichia coli TRS, demonstrating for the first time the predictive power of the approach at a large scale. We use the matrix-based model of E. coli transcriptional regulation to generate novel findings about the system, including new functional motifs; sets of genes whose regulation is poorly understood; and features of the TRS structure."

In insects, symbiotic bacteria are able among other things to modulate the immune response and the development of the insect from larval stages to adult. Many bacteria first gain access to insect tissues, such as the gut, during larval development, and are acquired from the environment. Thus, depending on the insect ecology, aquatic vs. terrestrial, the bacterial gut flora found in insects can vary widely. Little is known about the events that follow bacterial infection in larval guts and the driving forces for colonization of the gut by such bacteria. We investigated the distribution of two bacteria, a Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) and a Gram-negative (Pantoea agglomerans) fed to sand fly larvae. Our results indicate that bacteria distribution in the larval gut is driven by their ability to multiply at a given pH, as pH in the gut also varies. Gut distribution by these bacteria lead to an immune response that the sand fly larva is able to modulate according to the bacterial species. Our findings can influence development of paratransgenic approaches that utilize bacterial symbionts to control vector population."

Among several mechanisms that may account for the suppression of T cell response, we here described the presence and role of T regulatory cells (also known as Tregs) in the human hookworm infection. Tregs are a minor subpopulation of CD4+ T-cells, which also express specific cell markers that allow its further identification (CD25 and FOXP3). Our results showed that hookworm infection induce an augmentation of Tregs in the peripheral blood, followed by the higher levels of circulating Treg cells expressing several markers and cytokines associated with cell regulation (CTLA-4, GITR, IL-10, TGF-β and IL-17). We also demonstrated that in vitro depletion of Tregs partially enhanced the naturally impaired cellular proliferation of lymphocytes from infected individuals after antigenic stimulation. Our results suggest that Treg cells may play an important role in hookworm-induced immunosuppression, contributing to the longevity of hookworm survival in infected people."

To define a murine model of persistent WNV renal infection, we characterized infection by WNV H8912, an isolate cultured previously from the urine of a persistently infected hamster. Our findings indicate that WNV strain H8912 is highly attenuated in both neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence for mice. The virus persisted preferentially in kidneys of the mouse, and less frequently in the spleen and the brain. Moreover, mice infected with WNV H8912 had a delayed induction of IFN- β and IL-1β expression and WNV- specific IgM response, but a constitutive production of serum IL-10. There was a lower proinflammatory response in mouse kidneys when compared to equivalent findings in the spleen. This response may lead to a reduced T cell response in kidneys, which could ultimately contribute to renal-specific WNV persistence. Defining a murine model of WNV persistence by using a well-characterized, hamster-derived WNV urine isolate should provide important insights into understanding the mechanisms of WNV persistence."

Viral RNAs are processed by Dicer-like proteins into small interfering (si) RNAs, which trigger the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly. Then siRNA loaded RISC inactivates cognate viral RNA. However, viral silencing suppressors evolved to counteract with RNA silencing targeting one or more key points in the silencing machinery. Here we show that in Sweet potato mild mottle virus, the role of silencing suppressor is played by P1 protein and it works by inhibiting si/miRNA-loaded RISC through targeting Argonaute 1 (AGO1). We confirmed using immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays that the interaction between P1 and small RNA loaded AGO1 is specific and direct. The suppression activity mapped to the N-terminal part of P1 containing three WG/GW motifs that resemble the AGO-binding linear peptide motif conserved in metazoans and plants. Site-directed mutagenesis proved that these three motifs are essential for both binding and suppression of AGO1 function. P1 protein is the only silencing suppressor identified so far that inhibits active RISC and this is the first demonstration of a WG/GW protein having negative effect on RNA silencing."

Leptospirosis diagnostic consideration febrile illness “ smear - negative malaria ” rural East Africa .","Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Despite its relatively common frequency, mild/moderate leptospirosis often goes unrecognized, due to its usually non-specific symptoms of fever, vomiting, and malaise. Knowledge of leptospirosis in Uganda is limited, and the disease may often be misdiagnosed as malaria. This study sought to define the percentage of healthcare seeking Ugandans in rural Western Uganda who have antibodies to Leptospira in their blood, suggesting prior exposure. We found 35% of study participants had antibodies to at least one Leptospira serovar, predominantly L. borgpetersenii sv Nigeria representing the Pyrogenes serogroup (20% of all participants). Individuals with increased odds of having antibodies to leptospires included participants who skinned cattle and those who reported monkeys near their home. Individuals who self-reported recent diagnosis of malaria were more likely to have leptospirosis antibodies. Antibodies to leptospirosis are not lifelong, typically lasting a few years. The high 35% seroprevalence suggests there is ongoing exposure. Further studies are needed to understand the burden of leptospirosis in rural Africa, the risk factors associated with exposure, and the public health opportunities to mitigate leptospirosis."

To respond to energetic demands and mitigate against mutational damage, cells control the mitochondrial populations within them. However, the character of these control mechanisms remains open. As experimental elucidation of these mechanisms is challenging, theoretical approaches can help us understand the general principles of cellular control of mitochondria in physiology and disease. Here, we use stochastic modelling to compare control strategies by studying their impact on the dynamics of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) populations as well as their energetic burden to the cell. We identify optimal strategies for the cell to control against mtDNA damage and preserve energy production and use this theory to explore the action of recently developed mitochondrial gene therapies, which reduce the fraction of mutant mtDNA molecules inside cells. We show how treatment efficiency may depend on pre-treatment distributions of mutant and wildtype mtDNA molecules: treatments are less effective for tissues consisting of cells with highly varying mutant levels, and long-term, rather than short intense, gene therapies should be favoured."

Using the frog embryo as a model system, we describe a mechanism of tissue separation that involves repeated cycles of cell attachment and detachment at the boundary between two adjacent tissues. Molecularly, this mechanism is based on a signal exchange across the boundary by a system of receptors and ligands—EphB receptors and ephrinB ligands—that are both integral cell membrane proteins, and thus require direct cell contact for signaling. In this way, cell attachment-dependent contact induces signaling which leads to a temporary detachment, followed by reattachment and a next round of signaling. Such an attachment-detachment mechanism allows for cell migration along the boundary, while at the same time preventing invasion of the stationary tissue by the migrating one."

Endemic to Central and South America, it affects over 10 million people and many more live in risk transmission areas. Although mostly asymptomatic at its initial acute stage in humans, damages can occur over the years in many tissues such as T. cruzi-hosting heart and digestive track. For over 40 years the chemotherapy of Chagas disease has relied on the use of two drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, though both are known to lead to severe side effects which often prompt to the discontinuation of the treatments. Despite having good efficacy against the acute stage of infection, its efficacy against the chronic stage is under question. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need of new anti-T. cruzi drugs. Several efforts have been made in the last years to establish reliable high throughput cell based in vitro assays to be used for drug discovery against Chagas.

Similarly, within the same task, we show that subjects initially only consider taking simple actions, but as training progresses the set of actions can expand to include useful action sequences that reach the goal directly by passing through multiple states. These results provide evidence that state-space and action representations are not static but are acquired and then adapted to reflect the structure of the world."

Protein N - terminal acetylation mediated NatC complex play evolutionarily conserved role regulating stress resistance .","What are the mechanisms used by animals to cope with stressful environments that inflict damage or restrict essential processes such as growth, development, and reproduction? One strategy is changes in physiology that increase stress resistance, and an extreme version of this strategy is diapause, an alternative developmental state that is enduring and stress resistant. In the nematode C. elegans, stress tolerance and entry into a diapause state called dauer larvae are mediated by the conserved insulin/IGF-1 pathway. Specifically, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 promotes stress tolerance and dauer larvae development. However, the targets of DAF-16 that mediate these processes remain largely elusive. Using an unbiased forward genetic screen to discover new mediators of stress tolerance, we identified natc-1, a novel target of DAF-16 and the insulin/IGF-1 pathway. natc-1 encodes a conserved subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase C (NAT) complex. The NatC complex modifies target proteins by acetylating the N-terminus. We demonstrated that natc-1 mediates diapause entry and stress tolerance. Furthermore, we elucidated regulation of NatC by demonstrating that natc-1 is a direct transcriptional target that is repressed by DAF-16. These findings may be relevant to other animals because both the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and the NAT system are conserved during evolution."

This organism contains a large genome, which varies greatly among strains due to a high frequency of genetic recombination.

Receptor transport between the plasma membrane and other cellular compartments regulates the number of accessible receptors at the plasma membrane that determines the strength of downstream pathway activation at a given ligand concentration. In cell populations, pathway activation strength and cellular responses vary between cells. Understanding origins of cell-to-cell variability is highly relevant for cancer research, motivated by the problem of fractional killing by chemotherapies and development of resistance in subpopulations of tumor cells. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is a characteristic example of a receptor system that strongly depends on receptor transport processes. It is involved in several cellular processes, such as differentiation or proliferation, regulates the renewal of erythrocytes, and is expressed in several tumors. To investigate the involvement of receptor transport processes in cell-to-cell variability, we quantitatively characterized trafficking of EpoR in individual cells by combining live-cell imaging with mathematical modeling. Thereby, we found that EpoR dynamics was strongly dependent on rapid receptor transport and turnover. Interestingly, although transport processes largely differed between individual cells, receptor concentrations in cellular compartments were robust to variability in trafficking processes due to the correlated kinetics of opposing transport processes."

In many situations, there is no explicit feedback or cue to indicate whether the decision is correct or not. Fortunately, our brain can evaluate decision uncertainty using the internal signals and subsequently make appropriate adjustments to initial decisions. The process of considering the outcome of a decision and whether a decision should be adjusted is called metacognition, and it tends to be automatically induced. Thus, decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, and the two processes are inevitably coupled. However, the neural systems supporting metacognitive processing remain unclear and have often been misattributed to the neural system of the decision-making process per se. Here, we have analyzed this process in several volunteers by imaging the brain activity in specific regions while they performed Sudoku and random-dot motion (RDM) tasks. Our results suggest the existence of a neural system located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) mainly involved in metacognition and independent from the neural system of decision-making."

Using the embryonic optic placode of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we identify basic genetic mechanisms of how distinct domains with different fates emerge from an early, seemingly uniform, neurogenic region. We show that the boundary between two transcription factors is critical to determine how many cells are incorporated in either domain. This is achieved by coordinated interaction of Hedgehog and Notch signaling, which control proliferation and regulate domain-specific transcription factors. The mechanisms employed here in an epithelial placode to determine photoreceptor precursors display similarities with the ones previously identified in the adult compound eye, further supporting the notion of a common developmental program for the larval eye and adult compound eye."

In particular, mycobacterium, the type of intracellular bacteria responsible for diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy, are very successful at establishing infection within macrophages. By studying Mycobacterium leprae, the etiological agent of leprosy, we describe an immune evasion mechanism whereby this bacterial pathogen utilizes our own antiviral immune response against the macrophage. Type I interferons (IFN) are a major part of our immune response to viral infections; however, this response will also suppress our ability to fight opportunistic bacterial infection. During infection of our macrophages, M. leprae induces an aberrant type I IFN response that subsequently suppresses our macrophage’s ability to activate the vitamin D-mediated antimicrobial pathway, a critical antimicrobial response for containment of mycobacterium. Thus, understanding how these pathogens can evade our immune response will be important for the development of new therapies against these chronic infections."

The female sand flea penetrates into the skin of animals and humans where it grows rapidly in size, feeds on the host's blood, produces eggs which are expelled into the environment, and eventually dies in situ. The lesions become frequently superinfected and the infestation is associated with considerable morbidity. Clearly, tungiasis is a neglected disease of neglected populations. We investigated the impact of a package of intervention measures targeted against on-host and off-host stages of T. penetrans in a fishing community in Northeast Brazil. These measures decreased disease occurrence only temporarily, but had a sustained effect on the intensity of the infestation. Since infestation intensity and morbidity are correlated, presumably the intervention also lowered tungiasis-associated morbidity. Control measures similar to the ones used in this study may help to effectively control tungiasis in impoverished communities."

The transition from the metabolically dormant spore form to the actively-growing, toxin-producing vegetative form is initiated by certain host-derived bile acids and amino acid signals. Despite near universal conservation in endospore-forming bacteria of the Ger-type germinant receptors, C. difficile and related organisms do not encode these proteins. In prior work, we identified the C. difficile bile acid germinant receptor as the CspC pseudoprotease. In this manuscript, we implicate the CspA pseudoprotease as the C. difficile co-germinant receptor. C. difficile cspA is encoded as a translational fusion to cspB. The resulting CspBA protein is processed post-translationally by the YabG protease. Inactivation of yabG resulted in strains whose spores no longer responded to amino acids or divalent cations as co-germinants and germinated in response to bile acid alone. Building upon this, we found that small deletions in the cspA portion of cspBA resulted in spores that could germinate in response to bile acids alone. Our results suggest that two pseudoproteases regulate C. difficile spore germination and provide further evidence that C. difficile spore germination proceeds through a novel spore germination pathway."
